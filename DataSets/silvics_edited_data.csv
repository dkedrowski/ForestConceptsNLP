"Florida maple has not been included as an associate in any of the published descriptions of forest cover types. It is often ranked as a major component of the understory stand, however (1). Associated overstory species include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), willow oak ( Quercus phellos), cherrybark oak (Q. falcata var. pagodifolia), winged elm (Ulmus alata), red maple (Acer rubrum), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), ash (Fraxinus spp.), water oak (Quercus nigra), and sugarberry (Celtis laevigata). Understory associates include American elm (Ulmus americana), dogwood (Cornus florida), possumhaw (hex decidua), winged elm, American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), red mulberry (Morus rubra), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), and white ash (Fraxinus americana). In Florida, associates are basswood (Tilia caroliniana), sweetgum, cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), water oak, willow oak, southern red oak (Quercus falcata var. falcata), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). Spruce pine (P glabra) is an associate in Alabama (6).",Associated Forest Cover,Acer barbatum Michx.,acer,barbatum,hardwood,1,0
"Across the range of Florida maple, average annual rainfall varies from about 1120 to 1630 mm (44 to 64 in). Precipitation is well distributed, with the driest months averaging no less than 50 mm (2 in). January normal daily temperatures across the species range vary from 11° to 18° C (52° to 64° F) maximum, and from -2° to 7° C (28° to 45° F) minimum. July normal highs are 29° to 33° C (84° to 91° F), and lows are 21° to 24° C (70° to 75° F). The average frost-free season is approximately 20° to 27° days (11).",Climate,Acer barbatum Michx.,acer,barbatum,hardwood,2,0
"There has been considerable confusion in the classification of Florida maple as a species distinct from sugar maple, and in the field, Florida maple is probably often confused with other maples (9). Florida maple has been variously recognized among authorities as southern sugar maple (Acer floridanum) and as a sugar maple variety (Acer saccharum var. floridanum). However; the distinction between (northern) sugar maple and Florida maple is based on the latter's smaller leaves with short, acute lobes, smaller samaras, andnd a more whitish bark (12). Numerous intergrades between the two species have been found in east Texas and in the zone from Maryland south to northern Florida (although Maryland is not included in the range of A. barbatum). It appears that genes of both taxa are present in this intermediate population from Mary land to Florida and limited gene exchange is still occurring where one or the other taxon comes in contact with the intermediates (7). The literature contains no specific information about Florida maple hybrids, but in view of its close association with sugar maple, and the intergrades between the two species already mentioned, it is not unlikely that hybridization between the two species may occur.",Genetics,Acer barbatum Michx.,acer,barbatum,hardwood,7,0
"Native Range The range of Florida maple (fig. 1) is discontinuous in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain from southeastern Virginia southwest across North and South Carolina and Georgia, into the Florida Panhandle. The range continues west across Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, into eastern Texas, and north across Arkansas into eastern Oklahoma. The species is also found in isolated spots halfway down the Gulf Coast of the Florida peninsula and at one location in central Oklahoma (8). -The native range of Florida maple.",Habitat,Acer barbatum Michx.,acer,barbatum,hardwood,8,0
"Reproduction and Early Growth Flowering and Fruiting- Florida maple is polygamo-dioecious. Flowers are small and are borne on long, puberulent pedicels in yellowish-green corymbs (12). They appear as small clusters at the ends of branches and mature in the early spring, before or with the leaves (3,13), usually in late March and April, about 2 weeks before sugar maple in the same vicinity. The fruit is a winged, green to reddish, double samara, smaller than that of sugar maple, and matures in early summer. There are no seed test records for Florida maple on file at the National Tree Seed Laboratory at Macon, GA (5). Seed Production and Dissemination- Florida maple has not been managed as a commercial timber species and no published reports of seed production, dissemination, or experience in forest or nursery regeneration are available. The method of propagating Florida maple from seed is similar to that for sugar maple (12). Germination is epigeal (10). Reproduction of Florida maple has been described as erratic and scattered, occurring singly and in small groups (9). Seedling Development- No information available. Vegetative Reproduction- No information available.",Life History,Acer barbatum Michx.,acer,barbatum,hardwood,10,0
"Growth and Yield- Because Florida maple (fig. 2) is primarily an understory tree, it is usually smaller and more spreading than sugar maple. A bottomland forest near Durham, NC, contained 23.5 percent Florida maple stems in the understory and 1.4 percent in the overstory (1). Recent inventories by the Southeastern Forest Experiment Station (2) show that in the five southeastern States, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, 91 percent of the Florida maple trees on commercial forest land are smaller than 13 cm (5 in) in d.b.h., and only 1 percent are 28 cm (11 in) in d.b.h. and larger. Total inventory of commercial Florida maple trees 13 cm (5 in) d.b.h. and larger in the 5-State area is 1,702,000 m³ (60,134,000 ft³) and of this volume 60 percent is in Georgia and Florida. Florida maple has a ""medium"" growth rate, meaning that dominant and codominant trees on better sites average 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) of diameter growth over a 10-year period (9). A composite of reports indicates that a mature Florida maple in the overstory may average 61 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. and 12.2 to 18.3 m (40 to 60 ft) in total height. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Florida maple is tolerant of shade (9). There are no reports of how Florida maple responds to release or other silvicultural treatments. Damaging Agents- Florida maple suffers no special damage problems (9), and perhaps it can be assumed that generally the same insects and diseases that attack sugar maple also attack Florida maple, because the two species are so similar (10). Special Uses Although Florida maple is not managed as a commercial species, it is used with associated commercial species for pulpwood, sawtimber, and veneer stock. It is included in the hard maple group and better trees may be used for furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts (12), although its scarcity, small size, and poor form limit it to occasional use for factory and box lumber (9). It has found considerable use in urban forestry as an ornamental or shade tree.

"Florida maple grows on fertile, moist but well-welldraineddrained soils on stream terraces, in coves, and on adjacent bluffs and ridgetops. It usually grows best on soils underlain by calcareous material such as limestone or marl. It also grows well on the Florida hammocks. Soils commonly are found in the orders Inceptisols, Entisols, and Ultisols.",Soils and Topography,Acer barbatum Michx.,acer,barbatum,hardwood,15,0
"Characteristic trees, shrubs, and herbs associated with bigleaf maple in five portions of its native range are listed in table 2. Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone, Pacific dogwood, swordfern, and prince's-pine grow with bigleaf maple in most environments. Bigleaf maple communities often present on moist sites include willow-black cottonwood-bigleaf maple and red alder-bigleaf maple/salmonberry. The bigleaf maple/snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) community is found on dry sites (5). Bigleaf maple is present but is not a dominant species in several other plant communities-western hemlock/western swordfern/ Oregon oxalis and Douglas-fir/oceanspray (western Washington and Oregon), Sitka spruce/devilsclubstink currant (Ribes bracteosum) (British Columbia), and white fir/Oregongrape (California), for example. Bigleaf maple is present in the following forest cover types (3): Red Alder (Society of American Foresters Type 221), Black Cottonwood-Willow (222), Sitka Spruce (223), Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce (225), Pacific Douglas-Fir (229), Douglas-Fir- Western Hemlock (230), Port-Orford-cedar (231), Redwood (232), Oregon White Oak (233), Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (234), Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (244), and Pacific Ponderosa Pine (245). Bigleaf maple supports several epiphytic plants in moist climates. This support is particularly evident in the ""rain forest"" on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, where epiphytes weigh nearly four times as much as the leaves of host bigleaf maples (19). Some of those maples, heavily laden with rain-soaked epiphytes, are more susceptible to windthrow than trees with less luxuriant epiphytic growth (32). A club moss (Selaginella oregana) and the mosses Hylocomium splendens, Leucolepis menziesii, Isothecium stoloniferum, and Neckera menziesii are the most abundant epiphyte species, but lichens (Cladonia, Nephroma, and Crocynia spp.) and the licorice fern (Polypodiuni glycyrrhiza) are also common (5,32).",Associated Forest Cover,Acer macrophyllum Pursh,acer,macrophyllum,hardwood,1,0
"Bigleaf maple grows over a wide range of temperature and moisture conditions, from the cool, moist, marine climate of coastal British Columbia to the warm, dry, growing seasons of southern California (table 1). Springs, streams, and other permanent sources of water are often associated with bigleaf maple in southern California, but it also grows on eastern and northern slopes in California where more than 600 mm (24 in) of annual rainfall occurs (15). It receives abundant moisture in the coastal redwood region of northern California (36). Bigleaf maple is not, however, limited to moist sites in southwestern Oregon, where it is found from moist stream bottoms to dry hillsides. Nocturnal moisture stresses of more than 2.0 M Pa (20 bars) have been recorded on some of those hillsides in southwestern Oregon. This maple also grows on hot, dry sites in the central-western Cascade Range in Oregon and does not seem to be limited by moisture deficiencies there (40). Moisture deficiencies seldom occur in western valleys of the Olympic Peninsula or in coastal British Columbia (25,32). Temperature probably limits the northern distribution of bigleaf maple (29). Table 1- Climatic variation in northern and southern portions of the native range of bigleaf maple",Climate,Acer macrophyllum Pursh,acer,macrophyllum,hardwood,2,0
"The native range of bigleaf maple extends from latitude 33°to 51° N., always within 300 km (186 mi) of the Pacific Ocean. This maple is not found in southeastern Alaska or on the Queen Charlotte Islands (34), but it does grow on Vancouver Island at least as far north as Port Hardy (25). On the mainland, the range is a continuous belt from near Sullivan Bay, BC, to within 16 km (10 mi) of San Francisco Bay, CA-a belt that includes the western slopes of the Coast Ranges of British Columbia, the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, the Coast Ranges of Oregon and California, and the western slopes of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington. The species is less common south of San Francisco Bay, but extensive stands are found in the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia Mountains. Isolated groves are scattered along the southern California coast to San Diego County. Bigleaf maple is common on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada north of the Yuba River and is present in less abundance as far south as Sequoia National Park (11). Most of the estimated volume of standing sawtimber is found in Washington (about 19.6 million m³ or 3.43 billion fbm) and Oregon (about 18.0 million m³ or 3.16 billion fbm). Almost half this timber is in Lewis and Whatcom Counties in Washington and Douglas and Lane Counties in Oregon (17). The estimated 1.1 million m³ (200 million fbm) of bigleaf maple in British Columbia is found on the south coast and Vancouver Island (16). -The native range of bigleaf maple.",Native Range,Acer macrophyllum Pursh,acer,macrophyllum,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Bigleaf maple begins to produce seed at about 10 years of age and continues every year thereafter (23). It is polygamous, and both staminate and perfect flowers are mixed in the same dense, cylindrical racemes. Flowers are greenish yellow and scented, and they appear before the leaves-from March, at low elevations and in the southern part of the range, to June, at high elevations and in the north. Pollination by insects usually occurs within 2 to 4 weeks after the buds burst (29). Pubescent double samaras result, with 3.5- to 5-cm (1.4- to 2-in) wings that diverge at less than a 90° angle. They ripen in September and October. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are abundant almost every year, but production by individual trees and stands can vary from year to year (7). Although most of the seeds are dispersed by the wind between October and January, some seeds can be found on trees as late as March. Bigleaf maple seeds are large and generally triangular or oval. They are 4 to 12 mm (0.16 to 0.47 in) long and 4 to 9 mm (0.16 to 0.35 in) thick. At field moisture content, filled-seed weights range from 5,200 to 7,900 seeds/kg (2,400 to 3,600 seeds/lb) for individual trees in the Oregon Coast Range. Seed coat comprises 60 to 70 percent of the seed weight (39). Seed moisture content reaches a minimum of 10 to 20 percent (dry weight basis) before the autumn rains begin in western Oregon. After the rains begin, seed moisture content varies among individual trees, but it increases by 140 to 200 percent. The pubescent seed coat appears to be effective in holding water and raising seed moisture content quickly. Seed collection and storage are best done when minimum moisture content is reached before the start of the autumn rains. Seeds in this condition can be stored without further drying for at least 1 year at 1° C (34° F) with only a slight loss in viability. Seeds collected after the moisture content has increased are usually killed by redrying, but they can be stored for up to 6 months at the field moisture content with a 30- to 40-percent reduction in viability Seeds stored in this way produce vigorous seedlings when planted in nursery beds (39). Table 2-Characteristic trees, shrubs, and herbs associated with bigleaf maple in five portions of its native range Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. It begins in late January or early February under field conditions and is usually completed by April or May in the Oregon Coast Range. Seeds germinate completely at 1° C (34° F) under laboratory conditions, beginning at about 60 days and completing their germination after 90 to 120 days (39). Because of this low temperature threshold for germination, seeds germinate early under natural conditions if moisture is not limiting. Germination during stratification can be used as a means of screening seeds before sowing. If seeds are stratified for 60 days and then germinated, the optimum temperature for germination is 15° C (59° F) (10). Exogenous gibberellin, cytokinin, or ethylene do not overcome the stratification requirement (10). A small number of seeds have been found germinating on trees in December before dispersal (39). Seed germination is excellent on mineral soil and organic substrates (7,25,39), and seedling establishment is best when those substrates do not dry excessively during the growing season. Bigleaf maple seedling emergence is not affected by Douglas-fir canopy density in coastal Oregon under conditions that vary from young-and-dense to old-and-open stands, but emergence is better under all of these stand conditions than it is in clearcut areas (7). An average 30 to 40 percent of the viable seeds germinate if they are protected from predators, and occasional seed lots attain 80 percent germination (7). All bigleaf maple seeds germinate during the late winter and spring after seed dispersal. Delayed germination does not occur in subsequent years (7). Bigleaf maple seedlings have a high juvenile growth potential, exceeding that of Douglas-fir and other conifers (38,39). When open-grown under conditions of adequate moisture and nutrients, seedlings reach heights of 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.6 ft) in one growing season. Competition affects growth, however; and first-season height is reduced by more than 50 percent when seedling density is increased from 1 to about 600 seedlings/m² (0.1 to 55.7 seedlings/ft²). Seedling weight is even more sensitive to competition than seedling height, and an increase in density from 1 to 60 seedlings/m² (0.1 to 5.6 seedlings/ft²) can result in a 50-percent decrease in seedling dry weight (39). The morphology of young seedlings is strongly influenced by density. At low density, branch development begins in the buds associated with the cotyledons and moves up the stem as height growth progresses. At high densities, branch development is suppressed and the few branches that develop soon die. Internode length is highly responsive to density, and the longest internodes are produced at intermediate densities during the first year of growth. The growth potential of bigleaf maple is rarely achieved in the field under normal conditions of light, moisture, competition, and browsing intensity (7). A survey of bigleaf maple seedlings in western Oregon showed that the tallest seedlings were 5 m (16.4 ft) tall and 20 to 30 years old. The height distribution of all seedlings in a stand most commonly resembled an inverted J, with 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) tall, 1- to 4-year-old seedlings, most numerous. Normal and bimodal height distributions were also observed in the western Oregon survey. Although these seedlings were all growing in the understories of Douglas-fir stands, shapes of the height-distribution curves did not seem to be associated with stand conditions. Few seedlings were found in clearcuts (7). Browsing by deer probably is the most important factor influencing the height and stem morphology of bigleaf maple seedlings (7). Temporary flooding is common on riparian sites, and the seedlings are able to survive short periods of inundation. Bigleaf maple is not as tolerant of flooding as red alder, Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), black cottonwood, Sitka spruce, and western red-cedar, however; flooding for 2 months during the growing season kills both maple seedlings and mature trees (35). Vegetative Reproduction- Bigleaf maple sprouts profusely after being cut. The large stumps produce more and taller sprouts, but all sizes regenerate vigorously. Sprout clumps have achieved heights of 5 m (17 ft) and crown diameters of 6.5 m (21.5 ft) in 3 years, with as many as 67 sprouts around a single stump (28). This sprouting vigor probably could be used in reproducing pure stands of bigleaf maple by the coppice method. It creates undesirable competition for the conifers being managed on most sites. Unlike vine maple (Acer circinatum), bigleaf maple does not appear to reproduce by layering. It can, however, be propagated from stem cuttings.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Acer macrophyllum Pursh,acer,macrophyllum,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Rapid height growth of bigleaf maple continues through the sapling stage, but it slows as the trees grow from pole to sawtimber size. Diameter growth is proportional to leaf area, and trees with large crowns develop more sapwood than trees with small crowns (37). The volume of individual trees ranges from 0.11 m³ (4 ft³) at 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. to 6.5 m³ (230 ft³) at 91 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. (24). The largest bigleaf maple known in 1977 grew in western Oregon and had a circumference of 1064 cm (419 in) at breast height, a height of 30.8 m (101 ft), and a crown spread of 27.4 m (90 ft) (26). The oldest attain ages of 200 years or more (2). Pure, 70-year-old stands of bigleaf maple have yielded about 315 m³/ha (4,500 ft³/acre). Under intensive management, rotations of 50 years or less could probably be used (16). Rooting Habit- Bigleaf maple has a shallow, widespreading root system well suited to the shallow or saturated soils on which it often grows. It probably has a competitive advantage over deeper-rooted species under such conditions. Reaction to Competition- Bigleaf maple is not a pioneer species that rapidly invades disturbed areas; however, it is often present in undisturbed stands and is able to respond with vigorous sprout growth after disturbance. Maple seedling establishment is most likely to occur in Douglas-fir stands after the start of natural thinning and before the dense understory characteristic of older stands develops. Light or other factors related to stand density apparently limit establishment. Increases in light from 0 to 20 percent of that in the open result in increases of from 0 to 60 percent in survival, but additional increases in light are not beneficial. Seedlings often occur in clusters, with various age distributions, suggesting that conditions favoring establishment vary from year to year (7). The presence of bigleaf maple in undisturbed stands and its potential for rapid growth suggest that it can respond quickly to gap formation or overstory removal. Maple seedlings often appear in intermediate or late seral communities. Bigleaf maple frequently follows willow (Salix spp.) or red alder in riparian seres (4,13), and sometimes it replaces oaks or Pacific madrone on upland sites. Silviculture of bigleaf maple usually involves control rather than culture. Bigleaf maple does not aggressively invade clearcut units, but vigorous stump sprouting is a problem when it occurs in the harvested stand. Sprouting can be control!ed by applying water-soluble amines or potassium salts of phenoxy herbicides around the sapwood perimeter on freshly cut stumps (21). Girdling the uncut trees is ineffective, for girdled bigleaf maples survive for several years and sprout. Aerial spraying of herbicides and other foliar applications are also ineffective-herbicide translocation is inadequate and the roots are not killed (22). Basal bark treatments overcome this problem. They are effective when ester-in-oil formulations of the phenoxy herbicides are applied (21). Dry sites with bigleaf maple overstories should not be clearcut if conversion to Douglas-fir is attempted. Seedling survival will be better if the Douglas-fir is underplanted, preferably after the overstory maples are killed with a basal spray of phenoxy ester in oil (20). When bigleaf maple is harvested as a crop rather than killed as a weed, often only trees that will yield a minimum log size (3.7 m by 25 cm, or 12 ft by 10 in) are harvested (16). Merchantable trees are usually scattered, limbing is laborious, and logs are short. Felling, yarding, and milling costs therefore tend to be higher for bigleaf maple than for conifers. Mill waste is also high-as much as 30 percent in slabs, sawdust, trim, and defect (16). Damaging Agents- Fungi are responsible for much of the defect in bigleaf maple. Decay is seldom a serious problem in young undamaged trees, but stem and branch wounds are invaded by wood-rotting fungi such as Heterobasidion annosum, Fomitopsis pinicola, Polyporus berkeleyi, and Inonotus dryadeus that can reduce the tree to a hollow shell. Overmature bigleaf maples are often decayed by root rot (Armillaria spp.) and butt rots (Ganoderma applanatum and Oxyporus populinus). Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum) occasionally kills forest trees, but it is most serious on ornamental bigleaf maples (14). The carpenter worm (Prionoxystus robiniae) may seriously damage living maples. It attacks trees of all sizes, particularly those that are open-grown. The resulting larval tunnels degrade the lumber cut from affected stems. Dead trees and maple products are damaged by powderpost beetles (Hemicoelus, Melalgus, Polycaon, Ptilinus, Scobicia, and Xestobium spp.), and a roundheaded borer (Synaphaeta guexi) makes large burrows in dead or dying trees (8). Bigleaf maple twigs and young stems are browsed by deer and elk. They are also clipped by mountain beavers. The roots are sometimes attacked by nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) (14). A high percentage of seedling mortality also results from predation by rodents and grazing by slugs and other invertebrates (7). Seed predation by small mammals is high, and it may be related to overstory condition. Seedling emergence on artificially seeded plots in the Oregon Coast Range is from 7 to 100 times greater on plots protected from birds and rodents than on unprotected plots. The highest rate of predation is in young (20- to 40-year-old) and old (80- to 250-year-old) stands with lower rates in clearcuts and in pole-size stands (40 to 80 years old) (7). Bigleaf maple is an excellent shade tree. Its wood is used in the furniture industry, but it is neither as hard nor as strong as the wood of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) (16). Like sugar maple, it has sweet sap that can be made into syrup. The flow of sap is adequate for syrup production in January and February, but the syrup is of a lower quality than that made from sugar maple (30). Bigleaf maple is a preferred wood for piano frames. It is excellent for decorative face veneer and makes good container material but is not suitable for flooring (16). The amounts of bigleaf maple being marketed for fuelwood are increasing as the use of wood stoves increases. Bigleaf maple has about 70 percent of the fuel value of Oregon white oak and 115 percent of the fuel value of red alder wood. Bigleaf maple is usually harvested in conifer stands along with the conifers. These trees generally originate from sprouts and are of poor quality. Higher quality trees could be produced by managing maple stands that originate from seed or planted seedlings. The Kimball maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh var. kimballi Harrar), a rare variety of bigleaf maple, occurs in the Washington counties of Snohomish, Cowlitz, and Pierce. It differs from Acer maerophyllum var. macrophyllum in having much more deeply lobed leaves, often tricarpellate flowers, and frequent triple samaras (12). Acer macrophyllum Pursh forma rubrum Murray is an even rarer form of bigleaf maple. First noticed at Berkeley, CA, in 1968 and later found in the Coast Ranges north of San Francisco, it has red leaves (18). The young leaves of an early German cultivar, 'tricolor,' are also red. Tricolor leaves are rose-red, however, and they later become marked with white.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Acer macrophyllum Pursh,acer,macrophyllum,hardwood,14,0
"Well drained alluvial and colluvial soils are well suited to bigleaf maple. Abundant moisture and a deep, gravelly profile produce the best growth-usually on river terraces, flood plains, and seepage sites (25). Growth is poorer on shallow, rocky soils, but bigleaf maple is frequently found on such soils. In the Coast Ranges of Oregon and the north Cascade Range in Washington, it even grows on steep talus slopes (1,5). Bigleaf maple is associated with many soil groups (5,25). On upland sites, these groups include the moist but well drained Brown Soils (Haplumbrepts and Dystrochrepts); Reddish Brown Lateritic soils (Haplohumults); Podzols (Haplorthods); both fine-and coarse-textured dry soils (Haploxerolls and Xeropsamments); and shallow, dry soils (Lithic Xerumbrepts). Soil groups associated with bigleaf maple in lowland areas include flood plain alluvium (Udifluvents); alluvial pumice deposits (Vitrandepts); wet, gley soils (Aqualfs); and cool, acid, well-drained soils (Boralfs). These soil great groups and suborders are found in the soil orders Inceptisols, Ultisols, Spodosols, Mollisols, Entisols, and Alfisols. Bigleaf maple does not require high concentrations of soil nutrients (36), but it is very sensitive to toxic concentrations of soil boron (9). Litterfall weights are greater under bigleaf maple than under Douglas-fir, and bigleaf maple leaves and litter contain high concentrations of potassium, calcium, and other macro-and micro-nutrients (6,33). Bigleaf maple is a soil-building species that benefits the sites on which it grows. Bigleaf maples grow at low elevations on the north side of Santa Cruz Island (27) but are usually found on riparian sites above 915 m (3,000 ft) in southern California, where the maximum elevation at which they grow is 2135 m (7,000 ft). Farther north in California, maximum elevations decrease to 1675 m (5,500 ft) in the Sierra Nevada and 1035 m (3,400 ft) in the Coast Ranges (29). In central and northern California, bigleaf maple becomes less riparian and more widely distributed (11), sometimes growing as shrubby clumps on the steepest north-facing canyon walls (15). This maple does not grow in the Central Valley of California (11). It is found above 310 m (1,017 ft) in steep-sided ravines and on mesic slopes in the Klamath Mountains (31) and at elevations of 1220 m (4,000 ft) on the Cascade Range in southern Oregon. The topography occupied by bigleaf maple in Oregon and Washington includes flat interior valleys, gently sloping stream bottoms, and moderate to steep slopes. It grows on both moist, fertile stream bottoms and arid, precipitous, south-facing rock outcroppings with slopes greater than 100 percent in the Coast Ranges of northwestern Oregon (1). On the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, the maximum elevation at which it grows is 455 m (1,500 ft). Bigleaf maple is seldom found above 305 m (1,000 ft) in coastal British Columbia, but it has been observed above 350 m (1,150 ft) on the east coast of southern Vancouver Island (25).",Soils and Topography,Acer macrophyllum Pursh,acer,macrophyllum,hardwood,15,0

At least two varieties appear to be confined to a definite geographic range: var. arizonicum Sarg. to central and southern Arizona and New Mexico and var. californicum (Torr. and Gray) Sarg. to the Central Valley, Coast Range, and San Bernardino Mountains of California (23).",Genetics,Acer negundo L.,acer,negundo,hardwood,7,0
"Boxelder is the most widely distributed of all the North American maples, ranging from coast to coast and from Canada to Guatemala. In the United States, it is found from New York to central Florida; west to southern Texas; and northwest through the Plains region to eastern Alberta, central Saskatchewan and Manitoba; and east in southern Ontario. Further west, it is found along watercourses in the middle and southern Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau. In California, boxelder grows in the Central Valley along the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in the interior valleys of the Coast Range, and on the western slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains. In Mexico and Guatemala, a variety is found in the mountains. Boxelder has been naturalized in New England, southern Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island; and in the Pacific Northwest in southeastern Washington and eastern Oregon. - Native range of boxelder",Native Range,Acer negundo L.,acer,negundo,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Boxelder is dioecious with imperfect flowers, although perfect flowers that appeared to be functional have been reported (12). The staminate flowers are fascicled, the pistillate flowers are drooping racemes and are wind pollinated (21,23). Flowers appear with or before the leaves from March to May, depending on the geographic location (13,28). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed crops are produced each year on individual boxelder trees beginning at 8 to 11 years of age. The samaras are borne on drooping racemes and average 29 500/kg (13,400/lb) (26). Ripening takes place from August to October and seeds are wind distributed continuously until spring. This extended period provides a variety of germination sites, moisture, and temperature combinations and may account for the prolific reproduction from seed that is common for the species (11). Seedling Development- Boxelder is capable of establishing itself on a variety of seedbeds. On southern Illinois bottom lands, it is among the most abundant species seeding in under cottonwood-willow and ""soft"" hardwood stands and invading old fields. On these sites, overstory density is apparently not a factor in early germination and survival, but seedlings begin to die off after 1 or 2 years unless openings are provided. The 1- and 2-year-old boxelder seedlings are also abundant in areas of ground vegetation ranging from light to heavy and in hardwood litter as much as 5 cm (2 in) deep (16). Methods of collecting, handling, storing, and testing boxelder seeds have been described (3,4,26). Germination is epigeal. Vegetative Reproduction- Reproduction by stump and root sprouts is common in boxelder from young, vigorous trees (8,18). Reports on propagation by cuttings indicate that best results are obtained from cuttings taken during the period of transition from softwood to greenwood and treated with an 8,000 ppm IBA-talc mixture (7). European nurserymen propagate some ornamental cultivars of boxelder using side grafts, whip and tongue grafts, or chip budding (7).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Acer negundo L.,acer,negundo,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Boxelder is a small to medium-size tree reaching 15 to 23 m (50 to 75 ft) in height and 60 to 120 cm (24 to 48 in) in d.b.h. The species is short-lived, attaining an average age of 60 years but rarely 100 years. Growth during the first 15 to 20 years is very rapid and may be as much as 2.5 cm (1 in) a year in d.b.h. (11). Poor sites bring a corresponding reduction in growth. In western Minnesota windbreaks, diameter growth averaged less than 5 mm (0.2 in) per year and height growth averaged less than 0.37 m (1.2 ft) per year during the first 13 years after planting (25). Boxelder typically forms a short, tapering bole and bushy, spreading crown. Because boxelder usually appears in mixed stands and has limited commercial value, no information is available about its potential yield. Equations are available, however, to predict volume of boxelder stems, and green and dry weights of stems, limbs, and leaves (24). After trees reach 15 cm (5.9 in) in d.b.h., the proportion of aboveground green components is relatively constant, with bole wood, 63 percent; bole bark, 8 percent; limbs, 22 percent; and leaves, 7 percent. Rooting Habit- Boxelder usually develops a shallow, fibrous root system. On deep soils it may form a short taproot with strong laterals (11). Reaction to Competition- In the area of its best development, the lower Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, boxelder usually follows the pioneer species of cottonwood and willow in colonizing new ground in alluvial bottoms. In some instances it is a pioneer species in the invasion of old fields (16). Boxelder may persist into the oak-hickory type but then begins to be eliminated, probably due to shading (18). The species is generally classed as tolerant of shade, although less so than the other soft maples (13). Damaging Agents- The chief rot-causing fungi attacking boxelder are Fomitopsis fraxinus, Perrenniporia fraxinophilus, Fomes geotropus, Fomitopsis scutellata, Inonotus glomeratus, and Ustulina vulgaris. Root rots caused by Rhizoctonia crocorum and Phymatotrichum omnivorum have been identified on boxelder, but Armillaria mellea has not been reported on the species, although it is common on other maples (14). Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum) is the only notable killing disease of boxelder. The species is also susceptible to a stem canker caused by Eutypella parasitica. A red stain in the wood of living trees caused by Fusarium reticulatum var. negundinis apparently is specific to boxelder. The stain regularly is associated with Cerambycid beetles and the galleries of other insects, but itself does no damage to the wood (14). Insect damage to boxelder is relatively unimportant, but a number of leaf-feeding and scale insects and borers attack it (1). The boxelder bug, Leptocoris trivittatus is a common associate of boxelder throughout most of its range. The nymphs feed mainly on pistillate trees in leaves, fruits, and soft seeds. Although the trees are not greatly damaged, the insect's habits of invading houses in large numbers with the onset of cold weather makes it an important pest. The boxelder aphid, Periphyllus negundinis, and the boxelder gall midge, Contarinia negundifolia, are also common. Other leaf feeders include the Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera castanea, the greenstriped mapleworm, Anisota rubicunda, a leaf-roller, Archips negundana, and the boxelder leafroller, Caloptilia negundella. The scale insects include cottony maple scale, Pulvinaria innumerabilis, and terrapin scale, Mesolecanium nigrofasciatum. Borers include the boxelder twig borer, Proteoteras willingana, and the flatheaded apple tree borer, Chrysobothris femorata. Ice and wind damage is common in older trees (11) and boxelder is quite susceptible to fire and mechanical damage due to its thin bark. Boxelder is highly sensitive to 2,4-D. In the northern Great Plains, drift from agricultural spraying operations produced distorted, blighted foliage up to 16 km (10 mi) from the source (20).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Acer negundo L.,acer,negundo,hardwood,14,0
"Boxelder has been found on virtually all types of soils, from heavy clays to pure sands of the orders Entisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, Ultisols, and Mollisols. It is most common on deep alluvial soils near streams, but it also appears on upland sites and occasionally on poor, dry sites (11,13). Through most of its range it grows in areas of little topographic relief, except for those features associated with stream valleys. In southern and central Arizona and New Mexico the species is found up to 2440 m (8,000 ft) (23) and in Mexico up to 2680 m (8,800 ft) (18), but even at these elevations it is confined to stream bottoms and wet draws.",Soils and Topography,Acer negundo L.,acer,negundo,hardwood,15,0
"Because of its drought and cold resistance, boxelder has been widely planted in the Great Plains and at lower elevations in the West as a street tree and in windbreaks. Although the species is not an ideal ornamental, being ""trashy,"" poorly formed, and short-lived, numerous ornamental cultivars of boxelder are propagated in Europe (7). Its fibrous root system and prolific seeding habit have led to its use in erosion control in some parts of the world (32). Seeds and other portions of boxelder are utilized by many species of birds and mammals as food (19). Because of the species delayed seeding habit, some seeds are available throughout most of the winter. The sap of boxelder has been used to a limited extent for syrup (9).",Special Uses,Acer negundo L.,acer,negundo,hardwood,16,0
"Black maple has been treated taxonomically as a species or as a subspecies in the sugar maple complex (20,25). In most practical forest treatments, because of its similarities in wood properties, black maple has been included with sugar maple and treated as a subspecies. Although their ranges overlap and black maple appears with sugar maple in a number of forest types, black maple is not usually listed as a component of these types. In some areas, black maple is found in large numbers; in others, sugar maple is found in nearly pure stands. Oak-hickory and maple-beech-birch are major forest types in which black maple is an associate (19). In the Mixed Mesophytic climax forests in the Eastern United States, black maple appears as a dominant member in the forest canopy in association with American beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), American basswood (Tilia americana), sugar maple, yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Q. alba), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) (5). The black maple-basswood association on north slopes in central Iowa represents a transition from a beech-maple climax centered in Ohio (18). On flood plains, the principal species in a transitional community are American basswood, slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), American elm (U. americana), and black maple (5). In five forest stands that were predominantly black maple, the proportion of commercially important species was as follows: black maple, 30.8 percent; American basswood, 14.9 percent; northern red oak, 8.5 percent; American elm, 7 percent; black walnut (Juglans nigra), 5 percent; white ash (Fraxinus americana), 3.5 percent; slippery elm, 3.5 percent; white oak, 3 percent; bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), 2.5 percent; eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana), 1.5 percent; bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), 0.5 percent; shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), 0 to 5 percent (unpublished data, North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN). In central Kentucky, on the lower slopes of ravines, black maple is well represented in mixture with American beech, white ash, blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata), yellow-poplar; white oak, northern red oak, and chinkapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii) (5). The understory vegetation associated with black maple is quite variable because of the variation in habitat over its range. On melanized loam soils in the Lake States area, the shrub understory consists mainly of Atlantic leatherwood (Dirca palustris) and species of Viburnum, blackberries and raspberries (Rubus), and elder (Sambucus). Ground cover commonly found in the area includes maidenhair fern (Adiantum pedatum), sweet jarvil (Osmorhiza claytonii), red baneberry (Actaea rubra), early meadowrue (Thalictrum dioicum), Dutchmansbreeches (Dicentra cucullaria), rue anemone (Anemonella thalictroides), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), and bristly greenbrier (Smilax hispidia) (30). In the unglaciated highland area of southern Indiana, where black maple is well represented, as many as 40 species have been listed in the herbaceous layer of the forest (5). Some of the most prominent plants in the understory are the common pawpaw (Asimina triloba), spicebush (Lindera benzoin), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and horsebrier (Smilax rotundifolia) (24).",Associated Forest Cover,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,1,0
"The important climatic factors within the range of black maple are as follows: normal annual total precipitation, 610 to 1420 mm (24 to 56 in); growing season precipitation, 300 to 510 mm (12 to 20 in); average annual snowfall, 15 to 150 cm (6 to 60 in) (28); average annual minimum temperature –120 to -340C (100 to -300 F); average length of frost-free period, 120 to 210 days; precipitation effectiveness index (effectiveness of precipitation at the temperature at which it fell), 48 to 127 (19,29). The factors limiting the distribution of black maple are a combination of temperature and moisture. A comparison of its range with that of closely related sugar maple shows that sugar maple extends about 4 degrees in latitude farther into the cooler north and ranges northeast into the mainland provinces of Canada, well into lower Quebec. But to the west, black maple extends into the warmer, drier; sub-humid grasslands 193 km (120 mi) farther than sugar maple, whose distribution ends at the western boundary of the humid forest zone. The importance of temperature and precipitation effectiveness is further reflected in only scattered appearances of black maple in predominantly sugar maple stands in Quebec, where they are considered relicts of a past warm, dry period (8).",Climate,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,2,0
"There appear to be two broad populations of black maple with respect to its hybridizing with sugar maple. One is in the western part of its range, where it maintains its identity and shows little tendency to cross with sugar maple (2,3,12,27). The second population is in the eastern section, where it hybridizes readily with sugar maple (9,11). Evidence of this has, in most cases, been based on studies of leaf characters, which are considered more useful in systematic studies than other characters such as flowers, fruits, and winter buds (12). In speculating on the hybrid origin of black maple, one of the parents advanced is sugar maple. On the basis of an ""average"" leaf constructed from numerous leaves of maple that were collected over its range, it has been hypothesized that the second parent is Rugel maple (Acer saccharum var. rugehii (Pax) Rehder) (6,25). The foliar stipules at the base of leaf petioles of black maples (fig. 4) are not found on either proposed parents and may represent a reversion resulting from gene interaction in the hybrid. In the Northeast, black and sugar maple are separate populations with distinct characters that are united by a large intermediate population which includes a variety of recombinations from the two taxa. Introgression by sugar maple occurs because of differences in ecological requirements. The cooler, more moist climate favors the survival of those hybrids and back-cross progenies that tend to be more like sugar maple than black maple (9). Systematic studies have been based mainly on observations of herbarium specimens of leaves collected over the range of black and sugar maple. Hybridization has been verified through intermediacy of leaf characters, but controlled pollinations have been successful between the two taxa using parents of Vermont origin (14). Crosses using sugar maple as a female parent were more successful than those using black maple as a female. Hybrid leaf shapes favored sugar maple in outline, but pubescence was intermediate. With a little practice, workers could easily distinguish hybrids between the two taxa among mixed 5-year-old stock-representing both straight sugar maple and black maple progenies and hybrids-by the intermediate pubescence and by differences in leaf lobules. In a provenance study of sugar maples, which included some black maples, height growth of the latter ceased earlier, fall foliage color developed sooner, and leaf fall occurred earlier than that of sugar maple (17). Exceptions were black maples from Iowa, which showed no differences from sugar maple. Young black maple trees showed less forking, or a higher degree of apical dominance, than sugar maples of the same age.",Genetics,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,7,0
"Black maple extends from New England, New York, and southern Quebec west through southern Ontario to central Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and southeastern Minnesota; south to northeastern Kansas and Missouri; and east in Tennessee to western North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. It was once found in Delaware but is now extinct there (20).",Native Range,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The yellowish-green flowers of black maple are borne on pendulous, hairy pedicels that are 3 to 7 cm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long, in subsessile corymblike inflorescences. Female flowers are found mainly in terminal buds; lateral buds usually contain male flowers with few or no female flowers. Like sugar maple, black maple is monoecious. Flowers are pseudohermaphroditic (flowers may be morphologically perfect but functionally they are unisexual) and occur in mixed buds. The rachis of the inflorescence results from the differentiation of the vegetative shoot. The latter is laid down first in the bud and consists of two pairs of leaves and a short stem. The leaves are arranged in an upright, protective manner about the lower part of the inflorescence. There is little difference in external morphology between vegetative and flower-containing buds when in deep dormancy The first expression of a break in dormancy is the swelling of the mixed buds, which take on a four-sided appearance. After budburst, the inflorescence develops more rapidly than the leaves. The time for full development of flowers depends on the air temperature but normally occurs in 3 to 4 days. Duration of stigma receptivity may range from 3 days during warm, dry periods to 8 days during cool, moist periods. The same dichogamous condition found in sugar maple is found in black maple. Protandry, or a male-female sequence in flower blooming, occurs in some trees while protogyny, or a female-male sequence, occurs in others (13). Pollination of female flowers is by wind and bees. In Vermont, the average flowering period is the first week in May. May is the average month for flowering in Indiana and Michigan (10), but over its entire range, April is considered the average month for flower blooming (25). Fruits that contain seeds are treated for germination as for sugar maple (7). After a 24-hour initial soaking in water, the seeds are stratified in a moist media. Germination is epigeal and starts with the appearance of a radicle about 6 weeks after stratification. Within a week to 10 days, a pair of cotyledons appears, followed by a pair of primary leaves. Two pairs of secondary leaves replace the primary leaves and a terminal bud is set, provided soil moisture is adequate. Second, and occasionally third, flushes of growth may occur during the growing season. Seed Production and Dissemination- Black maple fruits are paired samaras, fused at the pericarps and each with a papery wing ranging in length from 15 to 30 mm (0.6 to 1.2 in) and in width from 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in). Wings may be divergent or parallel in varying degrees. At seedfall, the fruits split apart and the peduncles remain on the tree. Fruit and seed size vary from tree to tree. Smaller fruits and seeds appear to be related to more divergent wings. Within trees, fruits and seeds are relatively uniform. In ripening fruits, the pericarp changes from green to brownish or reddish green. The outer integument of the seed changes from silver to brown. The seeds are exalbuminous, having no endosperm. Fruits of black maple ripen on schedule in the fall with sugar maple fruits. In New England, seedfall occurs in late September and early October, depending on latitude and altitude. Heavy seed crops usually occur in 4-year cycles in Vermont and surrounding States, with lighter seed production during intervening years. Although the fruits and seeds are moderately heavy, during high winds the papery wing of the fruits can carry the seed considerable distances from the seed tree. Size and weight of black maple fruits and seeds follow closely those of sugar maple, which averages 15,500 seeds per kilogram (7,030/lb) (28). Seedling Development- Black maple produces a sufficient quantity of seeds and subsequent seedlings to reproduce itself over its entire range but finds more optimum conditions for reproduction in the midwestern and western parts of its range. In a maple-basswood community located on a north slope in central Iowa, one seedling count was 40,150/ha (16,250/acre). On a western slope dominated by oaks and hickories, the count dropped to 8,400/ha (3,400/acre), and under floodplain conditions, 740/ha (300/acre) (1). Germination of black maple seeds is epigeal (26). In central Kentucky, black and sugar maple together with beech are successfully reproduced on limestone soils on lower slopes. On the upper slopes, a great increase in the abundance of black maple in the understory indicates a movement of black maple and other species from the lower to the upper slopes at the expense of oaks and hickories(5). The scattered growth of black maple in cooler, more moist southern Quebec and northern New England indicates it cannot compete successfully with sugar maple in these areas (9,11). The few stands in southern Quebec where black maple still can be found are considered remnants of an earlier warmer and drier period (9). Survival and growth of outplanted black maple seedlings in experimental plantings are similar to that of sugar maple (fig. 3). Seedlings of both taxa during the initial developmental stages in the plantation require protection from competing vegetation and gnawing rodents. Where deer are prevalent, protection must be provided or seedlings should be planted that are tall enough to extend beyond their reach. Vegetative Reproduction- No information available. Growth and Yield- The average height and diameter of black maple after six growing seasons in a transplant bed were 1.9 m (6.3 ft) and 21 mm (0.84 in), respectively. Among plantation-grown black maple, the average height and d.b.h. after nine growing seasons were 4.9 m (16.1 ft) and 6.4 cm (2.5 in), respectively. Mature trees reach heights of 21 to 34 m (70 to 110 ft) and more than 100 cm (40 in) in d.b.h. (4). In central Iowa, the average height of maple trees ranged from 14 to 23 m (43 to 75 ft). The median diameter class was 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. Black maples in maple-basswood communities were adversely affected when subjected to a severe drought (1). Total volume of all commercially important species in five stands dominated by black maple was 191 m3 (6,756 ft3), of which 73 m3 (2,564 ft8) or 39 percent was black maple (unpublished data, North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Black maple is classed as very tolerant of shade. Seedlings prosper under heavy forest cover and trees respond to release even after extreme and prolonged suppression. Damaging Agents-The damaging agents of black maple are considered to be the same as those for sugar maple.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,13,0
"Several general soil types lie within the range of black maple. In the cooler, more moist areas they are podzolic (order Spodosols), subject to mineral and organic losses through leaching and eluviation. In the warmer and more temperate sections are melanized, cryptorganic, and vadose soils of sialic substrata. In the drier, subhumid western areas of its range, the invasion of the prairies by forests has resulted in degraded chernozems or embryonic groods (30). These soils are included in the orders Mollisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, and Spodosols. In the part of the black maple range included in northwestern Ohio, northern Indiana, and southwestern Michigan, the soils are light in color and low in organic matter; there are dark-colored, poorly drained areas dispersed among them. These soils were developed from various types of glacial deposit and are variable in texture (23). In western Ohio, black maple increases in abundance as the soil type changes from a silty clay loam to a silt loam, indicating that poorer aeration and internal drainage react unfavorably with the taxon(26). In central Iowa, black maple is found on welldrained, moderate slopes with dark topsoils 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) deep, grading into a subsoil that is yellow-brown clay, changing to calcareous clay till at 75 cm (30 in) (18). In Quebec and New York, black maples are restricted to rich, low grounds with a limestone substratum (11). In central and northern Missouri, black maple in association with other species is found in rich woods, on slopes, in ravines and valleys, and near streams (27). In a study of black maple originating in glaciated and unglaciated areas of Ohio, it was concluded that the present-day population is a postglacial hybrid swarm between black and sugar maple, and that black maple had not been subjected to strong selection forces as the result of glaciation (22).",Soils and Topography,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,15,0
"The wood properties of black and sugar maple overlap in a narrow range and for all practical purposes are considered the same. A sampling of black maple trees showed that the average vessel segment length was 340 ~; the average fiber length was 845 ~. Sugar maple had 15 percent more uniseriate rays than black maple (21). Black maples are tapped for sap in the process of making maple syrup. Tests on unreplicated plots of black and sugar maple showed little differences between the two taxa in the sugar content of sap (16). In Marshall County, IN, individual volume tables were developed for both black and sugar maple. These were combined when statistical analysis indicated no significant differences (15).",Special Uses,Acer nigrum Michx. f.,acer,nigrum,hardwood,16,0
"In the Central Forest Region, Silver Maple-American Elm (Society of American Foresters Type 62) is a major eastern forest cover type (7). In addition to American elm (Ulmus americana), other major associates of silver maple are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), pin oak (Quercus palustris), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor), eastern cottonwood (Populus de/toides), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). Understory species commonly found with silver maple in the Central Forest Region are willow (Salix spp.), redberry elder (Sambucus pubens), red-osier dogwood (Corn us stolonifera) and greenbriar (Smilax spp.).

There is no information on specific climatic factors that may influence the natural range of silver maple. It is not found in the colder climate of high mountainous areas, and in the drier parts of its range it grows only along streams where ample moisture is available.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Silver maple is the first of the maples to bloom in North America, beginning as early as February and extending into May (38). Flowers are greenish yellow and bloom long before the leaves appear. They are borne on short pedicels in sessile, axillary fascicles on shoots of the previous year, or on short, spurlike branchlets developed the year before. Separate clusters of female and male flowers appear on the same tree or on different trees (19,37). Four types of trees, with respect to sex expression, have been observed: all male flowers; all female flowers but with rudimentary pistils; mostly male with a few females; and mostly male with a few females and a scattering of hermaphroditic flowers (19). Silver maples growing in Holland showed a tendency for the same tree to produce female flowers one year and both female and male flowers the next year. Trees that produced all male flowers did not show this type of change (6). Fruits and seeds of silver maple develop rapidly. Within 24 hours after pollination flower parts become withered and ovaries begin to swell. Fruits are about 6 mm (0.25 in) long 1 week after pollination. At the end of 3 weeks, when they become mature samaras, the fruits are about 5 cm (2 in) long. Fruit pedicels are short, ranging in length from 2.5 cm (1 in) to nearly 9 cm (3.5 in) (19). Ripening fruits change from a green or rose color to yellowish or reddish brown. Seeds to be placed in storage should be picked when their moisture content is more than 30 percent and should be maintained at this level. Seeds with less than 30 percent moisture content lose their viability quickly. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed ripening and dispersal over the range of the species begins in April and ends in June. The number of seed-filled fruits per kilogram ranges from 1,980 to 7,050 (900 to 3,200/lb), with an average of 3,920 (1,780/lb), making these the largest seeds of any maple species in the United States (38). Dissemination is mainly by wind and occasionally by water. The minimum seed-bearing age of trees is 11 years. Seedling Development- Silver maple seeds require no stratification or pretreatment. They are capable of germinating immediately at maturity. When seeds are covered, germination is hypogeal, the cotyledons remaining below ground. This is contrary to evidence reported previously which states that germination of all maples is epigeal (38), i.e., where the cotyledons are borne above the surface of the soil. When seeds germinate on bare soil, there is little development of the hypocotyl; the cotyledons shed their fruit coat and spread apart as in epigeal germination (6). Natural regeneration of young seedlings is most successful on seedbeds of moist, mineral soils with considerable organic matter (48). Seedlings that are established on bottomland sites are often stunted if the soil becomes saturated with water but generally recover when soil moisture drops. When growing in potassium-deficient soils, plants are stunted; young leaves are chlorotic and older leaves are necrotic (30). Initial growth of seedlings may be rapid, ranging from 30 to 90 cm (12 to 36 in) in the first year, but as they cannot compete with overtopping vegetation, first-year mortality is high if they are not released. Seedlings of silver maple require 2,000 to 2,500 hours of chilling to break dormancy. No differences were found in the time of first budbreak between cold-stored and nursery-lifted stock; there is a strong correlation between time of first budburst and root regeneration after the seedlings are transformed to environmental conditions suitable for growth. Maximum root regeneration takes place after 3,500 hours of chilling, but new roots can develop from November to May (47). The preferred size of seedlings for establishing plantations of silver maple in Ontario is 30 cm (12 in) in height and 6 mm (0.25 in) in root-collar diameter (43). Vegetative Reproduction-Silver maple can be propagated vegetatively. Softwood cuttings taken in July and again in October rooted 100 percent and 92 percent, respectively (34). Hardwood cuttings taken in early winter and stored in a cool place for 2 months rooted 84 percent when planted in moist sand (13). The treatment of silver maple cuttings with rooting hormones may be important to rooting success (18). Cuttings taken from young trees (5 years of age) root easily, but cuttings from mature trees (80 years old) root very poorly. Success in bud grafting is mixed. Graft-takes among clones may range from 0 to 40 percent when the branches from which bud sticks are collected have lateral, epicormic, and coppice origins. A high degree of success was recorded for bud grafts of the hybrid red maple x silver maple made on 4-month-old silver maple seedlings (48). Layering has been used successfully to propagate the species. Horizontally oriented stems have greater rooting success than vertical stems. Although layering occurs without hormone treatment, maximum results are obtained from treated stems. Prolific sprouting from the root collars and lower stems of living trees is characteristic of the species. Sprouts appear readily from stumps that are 30 cm (12 in) or less in diameter.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Acer saccharinum L.,acer,saccharinum,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Growth of young trees is seriously affected by competition from other vegetation. Height growth averaged 3.8 m (12.5 ft) after five growing seasons under plantation conditions where site preparation was intense and weed control was complete (44). With no site preparation, the average height of trees of the same age was only 0.5 m (1.6 ft). Seedling growth is increased by the application of 56 g (2 oz) in slow release packets of 19-5-17 (N-P-K) fertilizer at the time of planting (1). Growth in d.b.h. of pole-size trees increased from 6 mm (0.25 in) to 13 mm (0.5 in) following a stand thinning to a 5.2 m (17 ft) spacing. Basal area of the crop trees nearly doubled and wood volume tripled during a 10-year period following thinning. Unthinned stands had only one-third of the basal area and two-thirds of the volume of thinned stands during the period (18). Silver maple grows rapidly in both pure and mixed stands, some trees growing from 13 mm (0.5 in) to nearly 25 mm (1 in) in d.b.h. each year (18). Plantation silver maples (fig. 3) in southern Ontario averaged 25 m (81 ft) in height and 29.7 cm (11.7 in) in d.b.h. at 43 years of age (45). One tree in Vermont consistently grew 5 cm (2 in) in diameter each year. Mature trees have reached a height of 26 to 37 m (90 to 120 ft) with a trunk diameter of 91 to 122 m (36 to 48 in) (37). Since the species is usually found in mixed hardwood stands, data on yields for silver maple alone are not available. Rooting Habit- The species has a shallow, fibrous root system. Survival would be enhanced by this system rather than one that is deep and taprooted, since silver maple is primarily found on the more protected floodplain and bottom-land sites. Its prolific root system is notorious for invading and clogging underground drainage and water lines that are not tightly constructed. Reaction to Competition- The tolerance to shade of silver maple ranges from moderately tolerant to very intolerant, depending on site quality and location. In general, it is considered tolerant on good sites and almost intolerant on poor sites (48). Foresters, in general, class silver maple as tolerant of shade (2), but the species has been rated very intolerant on bottom-land sites in the South (48). Seedlings are intermediate in tolerance to water-saturated soils (12) but can tolerate prolonged periods of inundation. On upland soils silver maple grows well but is highly intolerant of competing vegetation. Damaging Agents- A number of diseases, insects, and other damaging agents attack the species. Their effect ranges from an unsightly appearance to the weakening and death of the tree. Chief among the foliage diseases on silver maple are gray-mold spot (Cristulariella depraedens); bull's eye spot (C. pyramidalis), which can cause severe defoliation of nursery stock; anthracnose (Gloeosporium apocrypturn and G. saccharinum); tar spots (Phyllosticta minima, Rhytisma acerinum, and R. punctatum); leaf blister (Septoria aceris and Taphrina carveri); and the powdery mildew fungi (Phyllactinia guttata and Uncinula circinata). Of less importance are the common spot fungi Venturia acerina and Cladosporium humile (10). Probably the most important stem disease in silver maple is Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum), which can cause sudden death. Other diseases of the stem that have either a secondary or parasitic effect are the target canker (Nectria galligena and N. cminabarina), the common mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum), crown gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens), and two that produce the brown felty covering over scale insects (Septobasidium burtii and S. pseudopedicellatum) (10). The Eutypella canker (Eutypella parasitica), formerly thought to attack only sugar and red maple, has been found on silver maple (9). A host of root and trunk rots attack silver maple. Seedlings are killed by Rhizoctonia solani and the imperfect stage of the charcoal root rot (Macrophomina phaseoli). Shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) is common on the species and kills trees that are already in a weakened state. A similar root rot (Armillaria tabescens) attacks silver maple in the South. A number of other decay fungi act on heartwood and inner sapwood. These are primarily in the Fomes and Hydnum genera. Flowers and seeds of the species are lost through the discomycete Ciboria acerina (10). There are no serious insect pests of silver maple, but the species is attacked by borers, leaf feeders, and scale insects. Among the borers are the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus); the flatheaded appletree borer (Chrysobothris femorata); the maple callus borer (Synanthedon acerni); and the pinhole borer (Xyloterinus politus). Leaf feeders are the fruittree leaf roller (Archips argyrospila); the cecropia moth (Hyalophora cecropia); and the white-marked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma). Bladder gall mites found on the species are Vasates quadripedes and V. aceris-crummena (3,4,46). An outbreak of the cottony maple scale (Pulvinaria innumerabilis) was controlled by treatment with large numbers of the coccinelid Hyperaspis signata (25). Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is not a significant pest of silver maple; the young larvae cannot become established on the species (27). Silver maple, because of its brittle wood properties, is highly susceptible to ice damage (5); when planted as an ornamental along streets it can be seriously affected by illuminating gas leakage from underground mains. It is known to react unfavorably to certain other air pollutants (14,15,16,17,41). The buds of silver maple provide a vital link in the food chain of squirrel populations (33). The early swelling and budburst characteristics of the species come during the critical late winter-spring period when stored food supplies of squirrels are exhausted. Local studies conducted on floodplains in the province of New Brunswick show that the species ranks far above other dominants on wet, mesic sites as nesting trees for wood ducks and goldeneye ducks (31). Silver maple ranks high as a food source for beavers in southeastern Ohio (29). According to availability, it is exceeded only by common alder in importance. The species is heavily planted as an ornamental in the urban areas of this country. Its widespread popularity is due to its early rapid growth and its pleasing appearance. Five ornamental subdivisions or forms are recognized in silver maple on the basis of leaf structure, coloration, and habit: (1) Acer saccharinum laciniatum-leaves are deeply cleft with leaf lobes that are dissected and narrow; (2) A. 5. tripartitum-leaf lobes are divided almost to the base of the leaf; (3) A. 5. lutescens-when the leaves unfold they are yellow-bronze; (4) A. s. pendulum-branches are pendulous, hanging or droopy in appearance; and (5) A. s. pyramidale-branches are acutely angled from the tree trunk, upright in habit, forming a crown that is narrow and pyramidal in shape (3Z37) The U.S. National Arboretum published a checklist of cultivars of silver maple based on the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (36) and included 58 names. In the fall of the year the leaves of silver maple change to a soft yellow. Silver maple has been planted as a farmstead windbreak in several locations in Minnesota. Its survival over a period of 38 years averaged 70 percent. Its height and diameter growth during the period averaged 11.6 m (38 ft) and 17.8 cm (7 in), respectively (39). In Ontario, tests of five maple species indicated that the quality of syrup from silver maple sap is satisfactory. Sugar content of silver maple sap ranked lowest of the five species tested (21). There have been no studies of population differences and racial variation in silver maple, possibly because of higher priorities currently given to other, more commercially important hardwoods. A program for the genetic improvement of the species for timber production is in progress in Ontario. Phenotypes with superior form, growth rate, and wood quality have been selected and are being evaluated (18). There are obvious differences in branchiness in seedlings from different silver maple trees within the same stand. These and other observations indicate that sometimes there is enough genetic variability to warrant selection (49). Because the blooming periods of silver and red maple overlap, there is a possibility of natural hybridization between them. Under controlled artificial conditions, the two species hybridize easily, producing prolific seed sets (8). The hybrids are intermediate between their parents in leaf characters. Their growth was much faster than that of red maple seedlings but did not equal that of silver maple. Hybrids first flowered at 6 years of age, but of several thousand flowers, only a few dozen fruit were produced, indicating incompatibility between hybrid females and existing pollen sources. Silver maple crosses readily with red maple when the latter is used as a female parent. But the reciprocal cross gives mixed results: some female silver maples set very few seeds when crossed to red maple while others apparently do very well (20,28). The species also is capable of setting viable seed to self-pollination. The basic chromosome count in silver maple is n = 26. Meiosis takes place in the fall, in contrast to other local maple species whose pollen matures in the spring (35,40). No serious abnormalities of meiosis resulting from hybridity between red and silver maple were reported, except in one cross where 2n = 71 and 72 instead of 2n = 78.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Acer saccharinum L.,acer,saccharinum,hardwood,14,0
"Within the range of silver maple the forest soils are predominantly brown and gray-brown podzols (orders Spodosols and Inceptisols) but the species is found most often on alluvial soils in the orders Inceptisols and Mollisols. Its best growth is in better-drained moist areas (11). On occasions silver maple may occupy low pH (2.2 to 3.3) muck or shallow peat soils (order Histosols), but is not generally found in soils where acidity is below 4.0 (26). In descriptions of forest vegetation, silver maple appears as a dominant species only in streamside communities or on the fringes of lakes or backwaters of streams. Occasionally it is found in swamps, gullies, and small depressions of slow drainage. Though it generally cannot compete with other species in upland environments, silver maple seedlings are adapted to survive long periods of inundation in bottom lands, where flooding is one of the factors that determine the makeup of individual stands (11,23).",Soils and Topography,Acer saccharinum L.,acer,saccharinum,hardwood,15,0
"The buckeye frequently have chromosome irregularity and pollen is often sterile (4). This has been considered as evidence of hybridization among the various buckeyes. One report indicated that in glaciated areas where Aesculus octandra is not found, its germ plasm has infiltrated the populations of A. glabra (4). A. octandra and A. glabra do hybridize, and intermediates showing the characters of both species occur as hybrid swarms. More often, individual plants of one species have one or more characters from introgression with the other species (3). Yellow buckeye hybridizes with Aesculus glabra (Ae. x marylandica Booth ex Dippel); Ae. sylvatica (Ae. x neglecta Lindl., Ae. x glaucescens Sarg.); Ae. pavia x sylvatica (Ae. x woerlitzensis Koehne, Ae. x dupontii, Sarg.) (7).",Genetics,Aesculus octandra Marsh.,aesculus,octandra,hardwood,7,0
"The range of yellow buckeye extends west from the mountains of southwestern Pennsylvania down the Ohio River Valley to extreme southeastern Illinois; south to Kentucky, central Tennessee, and northern Alabama; east to northern Georgia and extreme northwestern South Carolina; and north to western Virginia and West Virginia (7). - The native range of yellow buckeye. Yellow buckeye grows in a wide variety of climates. Average annual precipitation ranges from 2130 mm (84 in) per year in local mountainous areas of western North Carolina to 990 mm (39 in) in southern Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The average annual snowfall ranges from 102 cm (40 in) in the mountains to less than 13 cm (5 in) in the southern part of the range. Average annual temperature is 10° C (50° F) in southwestern Pennsylvania and 16° C (60° F) in northern Georgia; average annual minimum temperatures are no lower than -18° C (0° F), and average annual maximum temperatures do not exceed 38° C (100° F). The frost-free period ranges from 150 days in the mountains of West Virginia to 210 days in northern Alabama and Georgia. Distribution within the State of Ohio is influenced by climate which may be modified by topography (3). Yellow buckeye grows best in river bottoms, along stream banks, and in the deep soils of the North Carolina and Tennessee mountains (4), generally on soils of the orders Alfisols and Entisols. It is a bottom-land tree in the northern part of its range, but farther south it grows on high mountainous slopes. It attains its largest size and is most numerous in coves and on northern slopes in the mesophytic forests of the Appalachian and Cumberland Mountains, and it usually is found on deep dark soils with a crumb, mull humus. Yellow buckeye is a more mesophytic tree than Ohio buckeye (Aeseulus glabra) (4). Yellow buckeye is abundant in the mesophytic forests almost to the boundary of Wisconsin glaciation (4). It grows locally within the area of Illinoian glaciation in Ohio and Indiana but is seldom found within the area of Wisconsin glaciation. Buckeye is considered a climax tree whose northward range was abruptly reduced during Pleistocene glaciation. If this is true, a reextension of its range northward probably has not occurred because the present environment is unfavorable (4). The greatest concentration of yellow buckeye in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee is in mesic coves, canyons, and ravines. The tree is commonly found at elevations from 460 to 1860 m (1,500 to 6,100 ft), with the greatest numbers occurring between 1220 and 1520 m (4,000 and 5,000 ft) (4). In the higher Cumberland Mountains extending from about 460 or 610 m (1,500 or 2,000 ft) in elevation upward for about 300 m (1,000 ft), yellow buckeye may make up from 15 to 30 percent of the canopy trees in the sugar maple-basswood-buckeye forest. West of the Appalachians and in the Central States, it is found locally and is usually confined to mesophytic sites in coves, ravines, and bottoms. The mixed mesophytic forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains and in the Cumberland Plateau Region include many species of trees, and yellow buckeye is usually a constant member of these associations. It composes 15 to 23 percent of the upper canopy trees in the stands studied in that region. Yellow buckeye is a common associate in the Sugar Maple (Society of American Foresters Type 27) forest cover type of the central hardwood zone and the Appalachian highlands (5). It is a minor associate in five other types: Red Spruce-Yellow Birch (Type 30) and Red Spruce (Type 32) in the southern Appalachians, Red Spruce-Fraser Fir (Type 34) at the lower altitudinal range of this type, Northern Red Oak (Type 55) on moist sites in the eastern part of the type range, and Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 59) at higher elevations. The soil and topographic conditions that are good for yellow buckeye growth generally are also excellent for the growth of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana)~ and various oaks (Quercus spp.). Many of the herbaceous plants that indicate excellent oak sites in West Virginia are probably indicative of equally good sites for yellow buckeye (4).",Habitat,Aesculus octandra Marsh.,aesculus,octandra,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Yellow buckeye is polygamo-monoecious; the yellow or yellowish-white flowers on a single inflorescence may be either staminate or perfect. They appear from April to June after the leaves. Only those flowers near the base of the branches of an inflorescence are perfect and fertile. The others are staminate and infertile. The fruit of yellow buckeye is a rounded leathery three-parted capsule, 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) long. More than half of the capsules are one-seeded, although two-, three-, and four-seeded forms are found in decreasing frequencies. The fruit of buckeye is potentially six-seeded, so variation in seed number may be due to aborted ovules caused by incomplete fertilization (4). The ripe seed is dark chocolate to chestnut brown, smooth and shiny, with a large light-colored hilum so that it resembles an eye. The cotyledons are very thick and fleshy and contain no endosperm. The seeds ripen and are dispersed in September by gravity, animal activity, and sometimes water. Number of cleaned seed per kilogram ranges from 60 to 66 (27 to 30/lb). Almost all seeds are sound. Following collection, the seeds should be kept moist to avoid loss in viability. Seeds require about 120 days stratification or prechilling to induce prompt germination (8). Germination usually is complete 3 to 4 weeks after spring sowing. Seed Production and Dissemination- No information is available as to the age at which yellow buckeye trees begin bearing seeds, the number of seeds produced by individual trees, the conditions favoring seed production, or the frequency of seed years. Seedling Development- Germination is hypogeal. It occurs in early spring after the seeds have wintered on the ground. Yellow buckeye develops a large taproot following germination. No reports are available concerning germination and early growth and survival of yellow buckeye under natural conditions. The natural occurrence of the tree indicates that moist, deep soils are most favorable for the germination of seeds and survival of seedlings. Vegetative Reproduction- The sprouting ability of yellow buckeye is not known. As in most hardwoods, however, sprouting is probably more vigorous when trees are cut at a young age. Trees that have apparently originated from sprouts have been observed in southeastern Ohio. Growth and Yield- Yellow buckeye, like Ohio buckeye, is one of the first trees to leaf out and begin shoot growth in the spring. General observation indicates that it has an intermediate growth rate. Under forest conditions it attains large size, has a long clean trunk, and is the largest of all native buckeyes. A large tree found in the Smoky Mountains National Park had a d.b.h. of 155 cm (61 in), a height of 26 m (85 ft), and a crown spread of 16.5 m (54 ft) (4). The American Forestry Association's National Register of Big Trees in 1982 recorded the largest known living specimen, located near Bowers Creek, KY- as having a d.b.h. of 124 cm (49 in), a height of 42.7 m (140 ft), and a crown spread of 16.5 m (54 ft) (1). Yellow buckeye is probably long lived. It reaches relatively large size and maintains itself in the mixed mesophytic forest. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Yellow buckeye becomes established, survives, and grows in competition with its associates of the mixed mesophytic forest; thus, it must be classed as a shade-tolerant tree. The local occurrence and small number of yellow buckeye probably is due to limited seed dissemination and to the inability of the tree to establish itself on any but the most favorable sites. The critical period of competition for this species appears to be during germination and in the early life of the seedling. Yellow buckeye is not a pioneer species and is seldom found on old fields or on other open land. The loss of viability in seed exposed to drying limits germination on dry, exposed sites. Damaging Agents- No major insect enemies of yellow buckeye are known that consistently cause severe defoliation or damage to the woody parts of the tree. A buckeye lacebug (Corythucha aesculi) has been reported as a defoliator of buckeyes, and in southeastern Ohio the yellow buckeye frequently is infested by this insect (2,4). The insect damages the leaves during ovipositing, stomata are blocked by multitudinous flecks of fecal matter, and nymphs feed on the leaves. Foliage on the young trees and on the lower branches of older trees is attacked early in the spring, because yellow buckeye is one of the first trees in southeastern Ohio to leaf out. By the middle of July, leaves turn yellowish or brown and many young trees are nearly defoliated. This injury does not kill the trees, but it probably retards growth. The sapwood timberworm (Hylecoetus lugubris) tunnels under the bark and across the sapwood and causes pinhole defects. Derocrepis aesculi feed on buckeye leaves (2). Yellow buckeye is occasionally attacked by the walnut scale (Quadraspidiotus juglansregiae) (2). Yellow buckeye is relatively free of diseases. Leaf blotch,Guignardia aesculi, is the most destructive disease affecting the buckeyes and horsechestnut. Rainy seasons are especially favorable for the germination of the spores of this disease. When trees are severely affected, from a distance the foliage appears to have been scorched by fire, and the disease may cause much defoliation. A powdery mildew, Uncinula flexuosa, attacks the leaves of buckeye, and a leaf spot Cercospora aesculina, and other localized diseases of buckeye have been reported (4). A leaf scorch that first develops near the leaf center and extends outward mainly between the veins commonly appears on urban street trees and has been attributed to heat and drought; but air pollution should also be suspect (6). Yellow buckeye wood is relatively free from fungus defects. Only Polyporus squamosus (9) and Collybia velutipes (4) have been reported associated with rot in living trees, although other rot fungi probably attack dead wood.",Life History,Aesculus octandra Marsh.,aesculus,octandra,hardwood,10,0
"The abundant, large nuts of yellow buckeye contain much starch but are apparently not suitable for food because they contain a poisonous glucoside, aesculin. The American Indian ate yellow buckeye nuts but first they roasted the nuts among hot stones and then peeled and mashed them and leached them with water for several days. This treatment apparently removed the aesculin. Young shoots and seeds of buckeye have also been reported to be poisonous to livestock (4) and some landowners in Indiana have eradicated buckeye for this reason. Because the seeds of yellow buckeye are poisonous, wild animals do not use them for food and therefore animals probably do not limit the reproduction of this species. The wood is used for pulpwood, woodenware, and sometimes for lumber.",Special Uses,Aesculus octandra Marsh.,aesculus,octandra,hardwood,16,0
"In the two centuries since its introduction into North America, ailanthus has probably become differentiated into genetically different subpopulations based on seed traits. Seed characteristics of ailanthus have been identified as traits that differentiate varieties and geographical strains. Ailanthus with bright red samaras compared to the more common greenish yellow has been named Ailanthus altissima var. erythrocarpa (Carr.) Rehd. A study of 11 seed sources from California and Eastern States found that seed width and weight were correlated with latitude (6). Northern sources have wider, heavier seed than the more southern sources.",Genetics,Ailanthus,ailanthus,altissima,hardwood,7,0
"Ailanthus, a native of China, was first introduced into the United States from England to Philadelphia, PA, in 1784. Extensive plantings in cities during the 1800's has resulted in its naturalization across the United States. An eastern range extends from Massachusetts, west to southern Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and east to northern Florida. It is found in less abundance from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington. Because of its wide distribution, ailanthus grows under a variety of climatic conditions. Within the naturalized range of the species, the climate can be temperate to subtropical and humid to arid. In arid regions bordering the Great Plains, low precipitation, from 360 to 610 mm (14 to 24 in) annually with 8 dry months, can be tolerated (7), whereas in humid localities in the southern Appalachians rainfall can exceed 2290 mm (90 in) annually (15). Annual maximum and minimum temperatures are -9° and 36° C (15° and 97° F). Extreme cold and prolonged snow cover restricts the elevational range to the lower slopes of the Rocky Mountains and prolonged cold temperatures have reportedly caused dieback, but resprouting occurs (1,7). Ailanthus grows best in loamy, moist soils but tolerates a wide range of textures, stoniness, and pH. On the dry end of the moisture spectrum it is drought hardy, and on the wet end it cannot tolerate flooding. The species is widely recognized by the urban populace since it frequently occupies and covers untended areas in cities. The species' tolerance of harsh sites led to testing for strip mine reclamation; a study in eastern Kentucky found ailanthus better adapted to acid spoil than to calcareous spoil and capable of growing on spoils with low to moderate phosphorus (17). Soils on which ailanthus is most commonly found are within the orders Ultisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols. Because of ailanthus' scattered and disjunct occurrence over a wide geographical range, a listing of associated species would have little significance. Forest stands around cities are common areas of invasion and establishment, but it may be an occasional or minor component of forests following disturbance anywhere within its naturalized range.",Habitat,Ailanthus,ailanthus,altissima,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The yellowish-green flowers of ailanthus appear from mid-April to July, south to north, depending on latitude. The flowers are arranged in large panicles at the ends of new shoots. A dioecious species, it bears male and female flowers on different trees, with male trees producing three to four times more flowers than are usually found on female trees (11). Male flowers are more conspicuous than female ones, emitting a disagreeable odor that attracts numerous insects. The foul odor of the male flowers makes the tree less favored for ornamental plantings in cities. Seed Production and Dissemination- Pollination occurs in the spring and clusters of seed ripen from September to October. The fruit is a samara with the seed in the center of a thin, oblong wing, well adapted for wind dispersal. The ripe samaras are greenish yellow or reddish brown. The seed usually persists on the female tree through the winter, characterizing their appearance, but can be dispersed any time from October to the following spring. The species is a prolific seeder; the most abundant seed production is from trees that are 12 to 20 years. After collection, seeds should be spread to air-dry. Number of seeds per kilogram averages from 27,000 to 33,000 (12,235 to 14,970lb) and germination after cold stratification averages 65 to 85 percent (7,18). Seeds should be stored dry in sealed containers. The recommended cold stratification is 50 C (410 F) in moist sand for 60 days. Seedling Development- Seeds, can be sown immediately upon ripening or stratified until spring. In nurseries, seeds are usually sown in the spring and seedlings transplanted early the following spring. Germination is epigeal. Vigorous first-year seedling growth of 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.6 ft) has been reported (1,11). Average survival on 11 different plantings in Indiana strip mines was 74 percent after the first growing season and then decreased to 58 percent after the first winter (5). This illustrates the winter damage and mortality frequently reported (1,7). Because ailanthus is intolerant of shade, reproduction in natural stands appears sparse and erratic except by sprouting. Vegetative Reproduction- The dense thickets of ailanthus reproduction on disturbed soils of road cuts and city building sites develop from root sprouts. Prolific root and stump sprouting has discouraged use of ailanthus as an ornamental species. After death or injury of the main stem the wide-spreading shallow root system can give rise to an abundance of sprouts. Sprouts have shown first-year height growth of 3 to 4 m (10 to 13 ft) (19). Thus, the species can be easily propagated from either root cuttings or from coppicing. Growth and Yield- Information on the growth and yield of ailanthus in the United States at this time is lacking. Maximum heights are often reported as 17 to 27 m (56 to 90 ft) and a maximum d.b.h. as 100 cm (40 in) (10,12). A short-lived species, it lives 30 to 50 years (20). On arid sites, 15 m (50 ft) or more of height growth can be reached in 25 years, with a straight bole for 10 to 12 m (33 to 40 ft) (7). At a New England location, trees reached a 10 to 15 m (33 to 49 ft) height and 9 to 11 cm (3.7 to 4.3 in) d.b.h. in 30 years (11). Rooting Habit- Ailanthus roots are shallow spreading, often apparent at the soil surface, and roots near the trunk thicken into enlarged storage structures. These large rounded structures are assumed to be for water storage, contributing to the drought hardiness of the species (4). There is a general absence of a taproot with most roots present in the upper 46 cm (18 in) of soil. Within this zone, the deeper roots send numerous small roots to the surface. Adventitious shoots may arise from any of the surface roots. Reaction to Competition- Ailanthus is a successional pioneer species, intolerant of shade (8). It competes successfully in mixed stands of hardwoods throughout its range, indicating that it was present at the start of stand establishment. Allelopathic effects on over 35 species of hardwoods and 34 species of conifers have been demonstrated for water extracts of ailanthus leaves (14). Only white ash (Fraxinus americana) was not adversely affected. Germination and growth of slash and Monterey pines (Pinus elliottii and P radiata) were inhibited by scattering leaves of ailanthus collected in June and July on the seed bed surface, while leaves collected in October stimulated germination and growth (22). Such studies point to a strong allelopathic role for ailanthus in forest succession. Damaging Agents- The species is relatively resistant to insect predation (7). Three insect species are known to feed on ailanthus foliage, however (2). Most noted of the foliage feeders in the eastern range, especially in the South, is the ailanthus web-worm (Atteva punctella). Larvae from this insect feed on leaves enclosed in a frail, silken web. Another larval feeder, imported from Asia, is the cynthia moth (Samia cynthia). Ailanthus is the preferred host for this insect, but wild cherry and plum can also become infested. The Asiatic garden beetle (Maladera castanea) feeds on numerous plants during night flights, including ailanthus. Although many fungi have been reported on the leaves and twigs of ailanthus, the tree suffers little from disease, and its pathology need rarely be a consideration in its culture (9). If ailanthus can be said to be subject to a major disease it would be Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum). Many trees were killed by this soil-borne wilt in Philadelphia in 1936. Shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) has been reported in trees in New York (16). While this tree is rated moderately susceptible to Phymatotrichum root rot (Phymatotrichum omnivorum) in Texas, it is considered most satisfactory for planting in the southern parts of Texas root rot belt (20,23). In Texas, seeds are eaten by a number of birds, including the pine grosbeak and the crossbill (21). Occasional browsing by deer has also been reported. Wind, snow, and hard freezes are damaging to tops of seedlings, while mature trees are resistant to ice breakage (3). Resprouting usually occurs, although repeated damage leads to a reduction in seedling survival.",Life History,Ailanthus,ailanthus,altissima,hardwood,10,0
"Ailanthus's main importance remains in urban forestry, the original purpose of its importation into the United States. The species, tolerance of noxious emissions of gases and various dusts assures its continued use for plantings in industrial environments. Tolerance of poor soils and low soil moisture dictates its selection for city plantings in arid climates as well as shelterbelt plantings and on strip mine reclamation projects, although its unfavorable traits (odor and root sprouting) have decreased city plantings. Root sprouting into fields is also a problem in shelterbelt plantings. Pollinating insects are attracted by the male flowers. Honey from ailanthus has been reported as having an initial foul taste that disappears with aging, resulting in an exceptionally good tasting honey (13).",Special Uses,Ailanthus,ailanthus,altissima,hardwood,16,0
"Alaska-cedar occasionally grows in pure stands but is usually found singly or in scattered groups mixed with other tree species. Associated species change with latitude. In California, Alaska-cedar may be found with California red fir (Abies magnifica), Brewer spruce (Picea breweriana), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), and western white pine (Pinus monticola); in Oregon and Washington, with mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), noble fir (Abies procera), western white pine, and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla); in British Columbia, with Pacific silver fir, western white pine, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), mountain hemlock, western hemlock, and shore pine (Pinus contorta); in Alaska, with western redcedar, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), and shore pine. Alaska-cedar is a component of the following Society of American Foresters forest cover types (5): 205 Mountain Hemlock 223 Sitka Spruce 224 Western Hemlock 225 Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce 226 Coastal True Fir-Hemlock 227 Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock 228 Western Redcedar Shrubs commonly associated with Alaska-cedar in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia are: big whortleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), ovalleaf whortleberry (V. ovalifolium), Alaska blueberry (V. alaskaense), rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), Cascades azalea (Rhododendron albiflorum), and copperbush (Cladothamnus pyroliflorus). These shrubs, except Rhododendron albiflorum and Vaccinium membranaceum, are associates in Alaska as well. Other plant associates include fiveleaf bramble (Rubus pedatus), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), queenscup (Clintonia uniflora), ferny goldthread (Coptis asplenifolia), deerfern (Blechnum spicant), claspleaf twistedstalk (Streptopus amplexifolius), rosy twistedstalk (S. roseus), and skunkcabbage (Lysichitum americanum). Recognized vegetative communities from British Columbia south are Chamaecyparis nootkatensis/Lysichitum americanum and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis/Rhododendron albiflorum (7).

Alaska-cedar is notable within the cypress family for its tolerance of cool and wet conditions. The climate of its natural range is cool and humid. Climatic conditions at elevations where Alaska-cedar grows in the Cascade Range of Washington are somewhat comparable to those at sea level in coastal Alaska (table 1). Growing seasons are short.,Climate,Alaska-Cedar,chamaecyparis,nootkatensis,conifer,2,1
"Information on genetic variation of Alaska-cedar is not available (10); however, 15 horticultural varieties of Alaska-cedar are recognized. An intergeneric hybrid, Cupressocyparis x leylandii (Cupressus macrocarpa x Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), has been described in Great Britain (16). This hybrid can be propagated from cuttings and has been planted at numerous locations in temperate regions with good results. Other intergeneric hybrids include Cupressocyparis x notabilis Mitchell (Cupressus glabra x Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) and Cupressocyparis x ovensii (Cupressus lusitanica x Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) (19).",Genetics,Alaska-Cedar,chamaecyparis,nootkatensis,conifer,7,1
"Alaska-cedar grows from northern California to Prince William Sound, AK Except for a few isolated stands, it is found within 160 km (100 miles) of the Pacific coast. Isolated stands in the Siskiyou Mountains, CA, near the Oregon border mark its southern limit (2). In Oregon and Washington, Alaska-cedar grows in the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains; scattered populations are found in the Coast Ranges and in the Aldrich Mountains of central Oregon (8). In British Columbia and north to Wells Bay in Prince William Sound, AK, it grows in a narrow strip on the islands and coastal mainland. An exception in British Columbia is an isolated stand near Slocan Lake about 720 km (450 mi) inland. - The native range of Alaska-cedar.",Native Range,Alaska-Cedar,chamaecyparis,nootkatensis,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Alaska-cedar is monoecious. Flowering occurs from April in the southern part of the range to June in the north. The tiny inconspicuous yellow or reddish male pollen-bearing strobili and green female cones are borne on the tips of branchlets. Pollination occurs from mid-April to late May in cones that were initiated the previous summer. Cones generally mature in 2 years, but in the southern part of the range they may mature in I year. Both first- and second-year cones occur on the same branch and may easily be confused. Mature cones are about 12 mm (0.5 in) in diameter and globe-shaped. Mature and immature cones are nearly the same size, so care must be taken to collect only mature cones for seed. Immature cones are green and soft, often with purple markings, and are home near the tips of branchlets. Mature cones are yellow-green and hard, often with brown markings, and are borne farther from the branch tips. Seed Production and Dissemination- Large crops of Alaska-cedar seed occur at intervals of 4 or more years (12). The proportion of filled seeds from mature cones is generally low and extremely variable. One study in British Columbia showed that the number of seeds per cone averaged 7.2; the proportion of filled seeds was only 29 percent (21). Cleaned seeds average 240,000/kg (109,000/lb) (12). Information is not available on the distance seeds are disseminated by wind. Seeds of Alaska-cedar are heavier than seeds of the closely related Port-Orford-cedar and probably are not disseminated beyond the 120 m (400 ft) reported for that species. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal, and the rate tends to be low. Warm stratification followed by cold stratification greatly improves germination, but optimum stratification schedules have not been developed. In British Columbia and Alaska, seeds ripen from mid-September to late September and are shed during dry periods in the fall and early winter. Empty cones remain on trees for 1 year or more. Formation of both pollen cones and seed cones can be induced in juvenile trees by foliar application of gibberellin-A3 under conditions of long day length. Cones induced by gibberellin-A3 yield higher percentages of filled seeds with higher rates of germination than cones that develop under natural conditions. Seed orchards should offer the opportunity for treatment and thereby provide a practical means of increasing cone production (22). Vegetative Reproduction- Alaska-cedar reproduces vegetatively under a variety of natural conditions from low-elevation bogs to krummholz at tree line (1,3,20,23). In southeast Alaska, layering is common on low-elevation bog sites, less common on better drained sites (14). In contrast, from Mount Rainier, WA, southward to California, layering is most common on drier, high-elevation sites (2). The species can also be reproduced from cuttings. Container stock suitable for planting has been produced in the greenhouse in 1 year by potting young cuttings treated with indolebutyric acid (17).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Alaska-Cedar,chamaecyparis,nootkatensis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Alaska-cedar is slow growing and long lived. In Washington, dominant trees on better sites are typically 30 to 38 m (100 to 125 ft) tall; in British Columbia, they are 90 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. and 23 to 30 m (75 to 100 ft) tall; and in Alaska, dominant trees are often 60 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. and 24 m (80 ft) tall, although larger trees are common. The largest tree on record, located in Olympic National Park, WA, has a d.b.h. of 3.7 m (12.0 ft), a height of 37 m (120 ft), and a crown spread of 8.2 m (27 ft) (13). Growth rates of 16 to 20 rings per centimeter (40 to 50/in) are common. In Alaska, suppressed trees 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. are frequently more than 300 years old; dominant and codominant trees 60 to 90 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. are from 300 to more than 700 years old. Trees that are extremely old have been reported; a hollow tree 180 cm (70 in) in d.b.h. had 1,040 growth rings in the 30-cm (12-in) outer shell (1). Rooting Habit- In bogs, roots of prostrate clumps of Alaska-cedar often tend to be shallow and to develop in complex patterns associated with a long history of branch layering (14). Root systems of krummholz Alaska-cedar-apparently the result of root sprouting and layering-have been observed to extend 100 feet (3). Understory trees have shown adventitious rooting the year after partial burial by volcanic tephra (26). Information is not available on the rooting habit of mature trees on well drained sites. Reaction to Competition- Alaska-cedar is considered tolerant of shade in the southern part of its range but less tolerant toward the north. Overall, it is classed as shade tolerant. South of Mt. Rainier, WA, Alaska-cedar establishes some seedlings and is shade tolerant enough to survive under moderately dense canopies, but forest-grown seedlings fail to develop a strong upright trunk. Most trees on forest sites appear to have been established after disturbance (2). In Alaska, young stands are often even aged, and mixed or nearly pure stands of Alaska-cedar rarely contain seedlings or saplings in the understory. Reproduction of western hemlock is abundant, however, indicating that Alaska-cedar is less tolerant than hemlock (1). Most Alaska-cedar timber has come from logging mixed old-growth stands in which the species is a minor component. Because of its slow rate of growth in relation to other commercial species, there has been little interest in management of Alaska-cedar for timber on the more productive sites. It may be well suited for planting on cold, wet sites, however, especially at high elevations where other species are less likely to thrive. It survives heavy snow loads because of its narrow, flexible crown and drooping branches, and its flexibility allows it to survive on avalanche tracks. Interest in management of Alaska-cedar is relatively new, and information on growth and yield of young stands is not available. Volume tables are available for old-growth trees (6). Damaging Agents- Alaska-cedar is relatively free from damage by insects. No infestations of defoliating insects are known (1). Both Phloeosinus sp. and the bark-boring, round-headed beetles of the genus Atimia are often found under the bark of dead, dying, or weakened trees and occasionally on healthy trees (9). Phloeosinus cupressi is a secondary agent that only attacks trees in advanced stages of decline (14). A total of 78 taxa of fungi have been reported on Alaska-cedar throughout its range, including 50 in Alaska (14). The wood, however, is very durable and resistant to fungal attack, partly because of naturally occurring chemicals-nootkatin, chamic acid, and chaminic acid-in the heartwood that inhibit fungal growth at low concentrations (4). Certain ""black-stain"" fungi are capable of degrading nootkatin, thereby increasing the susceptibility of the heartwood to decay (24). Living trees often attain great age, and over time heart-rotting fungi cause considerable loss and defect in standing trees (15). Since at least 1880, Alaska-cedar has suffered advancing decline and mortality on more than 100 000 ha (247,000 acres) of bog and semibog land in southeast Alaska. Abiotic factors appear to be responsible, but the primary cause remains unknown (14). In southeast Alaska, brown bears (Ursa arctos) frequently cause basal scarring by biting and stripping bark. Scarring is most common on well drained sites. This wounding results in fungal attack, which in time reduces volume and value of butt logs (14).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Alaska-Cedar,chamaecyparis,nootkatensis,conifer,14,1
"Alaska-cedar grows most commonly on Histosols and Spodosols. Best growth and development are on slopes with deep, well-drained soils. It is seldom found on the better sites, however, because of competition from faster growing associates. More frequently, it is found on thin organic soils over bedrock and is able to survive and grow on soils that are deficient in nutrients. It grows well on soils rich in calcium and magnesium and frequently on Lithosols developed from andesite, diorite, gabbro, or basaltic rocks (18). It is a common component of ""scrub"" stands on organic soils at low elevations in Alaska, and on organic subalpine soils. At high elevations and on half-bog sites, it often develops a shrublike or prostrate form. Alaska-cedar grows at elevations from 600 to 2300 m (2,000 to 7,500 ft) in the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington and occasionally down to sea level on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington and the west coast of Vancouver Island. In Oregon, most Alaska-cedar grows on ridges and peaks from 1500 to 1700 m (5,000 to 5,600 ft) high in the western Cascades between the Clackamas and McKenzie rivers, but it can grow throughout much of the moisture conditions present at high elevations in the Cascade Range from central Oregon north (2). On the southern British Columbia mainland, it usually grows between 600 and 1500 m (2,000 and 5,000 ft) but is found at lower elevations northward until it reaches sea level at Knight Inlet. From there, north and west to Prince William Sound in Alaska, it is found from sea level to tree line, up to 900 m (3,000 ft) in southeast Alaska and 300 m (1,000 ft) around Prince William Sound.",Soils and Topography,Alaska-Cedar,chamaecyparis,nootkatensis,conifer,15,1

"Alpine larch grows in pure stands and also in association with whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) near their upper limits. Alpine larch stands are primarily considered a variant forest cover type within Whitebark Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 208) (26). The species is also associated with the upper elevations of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206), especially in the Canadian Rockies. Near the crest of the Cascades, alpine larch is often associated with mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) and subalpine fir. In Montana, stands above forest line (where subalpine fir is severely stunted) make up the Larix lyallii-Abies lasiocarpa habitat types classified by Pfister and others (20). Alpine larch stands below forest line (in the subalpine fir zone) are classified generally as an edaphic (rock substrate) climax within the broader Abies lasiocarpa/Luzula hitchcockii habitat type, Menziesia ferruginea phase. Four species dominate in the undergrowth of most alpine larch stands throughout the Pacific Northwest: grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium); smooth woodrush (Luzula hitchcockii); mountain arnica (Arnica latifolia); and red mountain heath (Phyllodoce empetriformis) (2). But undergrowth beneath larch stands on bogs, recent moraines, alpine tundra, or rockpile sites, is distinctively different. Often shrublike (krummholz) subalpine fir and whitebark pine form an undergrowth layer beneath the larch on relatively cold or wind-exposed sites.",Associated Forest Cover,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,1,1
"Alpine larch grows in a very cold, snowy, and generally moist climate. The following description is based on weather records from several sites in and near alpine larch stands (2). For more than half of the year, mean temperatures are below freezing. The cool ""growing season,"" as defined by mean temperatures of more than 6° C (42° F) (6), lasts about 90 days, and occasional frosts and snowfalls occur during the summer. July mean temperatures range from about 9° to 14° C (48° to 58° F). Long-term record low temperatures for late June through mid-August are near -5° C (23° F), whereas corresponding record highs are near 27° C (80° F). January mean temperatures range from about -14° C (7° F) in Alberta to -7° C (20° F) in the northern Cascades. Long-term record low temperatures have undoubtedly reached -50° C (-58° F) in some stands near the Continental Divide in Alberta and Montana. Mean annual precipitation for most alpine larch sites is between 800 and 1900 mm (32 and 75 in), the larger amount being more prevalent near the crest of the Cascades. Most stands in the Montana Bitterroot Range evidently receive 1000 to 1500 mm (40 to 60 in). About 75 percent of this precipitation is snow and sleet. Typically, the new snowpack begins to accumulate by late October. By mid-April, it reaches a maximum depth averaging about 2.1 m (7 ft) in stands near the Continental Divide and 3.0 to 3.5 m (10 to 11 ft) farther west. Maximum water content of the snowpack is attained in May and reaches about 75 cm (30 in) in stands near the Continental Divide and 100 to 125 cm. (40 to 50 in) farther west. The snowpack does not melt away in most stands until early July. Average annual snowfall is probably about 1000 cm (400 in) in most stands west of the Continental Divide. Small amounts of stunted alpine larch grow on wind-exposed ridgetops and other microsites where snow accumulation is much less than the averages indicated above. The inland Pacific Northwest often has a droughty period for a few weeks in late summer. This drought effect is minor in most alpine larch sites; however, dry surface soils may prevent seedling establishment in certain years. A modest quantity of rain falls through July and August, averaging 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) per month in the United States, much of it associated with thunderstorms. In the Canadian Rockies summer precipitation is greater, 50 to 90 mm (2.0 to 3.5 in) per month, and more of it comes in Pacific frontal systems. Summertime relative humidity in alpine larch stands remains consistently higher than that recorded at lower elevations. Most alpine larch stands annually experience winds reaching hurricane velocity, 117 km/h (73 mi/h) or more, during thunderstorms or during the passage of frontal systems. Ridgetop stands are exposed to violent winds most frequently.",Climate,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,2,1
"Races, varieties, or subspecies of alpine larch are not known. The species' restricted environmental tolerances and geographical and altitudinal distributions may have limited the opportunity for development of genetic variation. Apparent natural hybridization of alpine larch and western larch has been documented in western Montana (8,9,10). Although these species occupy a similar geographic area, they inhabit different altitudinal zones and are usually separated from each other by 150 to 300 m (500 to 1,000 ft) of elevation at their closest proximities. Nevertheless, their distributions occasionally overlap slightly in north-slope snowslide chutes or talus rockpiles. Apparent natural hybrids have been identified in two overlap areas using a hybrid-index formula. The two species were also artificially cross-pollinated and the resulting seed and that from control species was planted. Distinct morphological differences were noted among the two species and the putative hybrid. The two species also vary in external and internal characteristics even when they grow side by side, confirming their genetic difference (8,9). An interesting mixture of both larch species and various intermediate (hybrid) forms occurs on a rocky site in the Carlton Ridge Research Natural Area in the Lolo National Forest south of Missoula, MT (10). The chromosome complement of subalpine larch is 2N=24, similar to that of most other trees in the pine family (Pinaceae) (7).",Genetics,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,7,1
"Alpine larch occupies a remote and rigorous environment, growing in and near the timberline on high mountains of the inland Pacific Northwest. Although alpine larch is found in both the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades, the two distributions are separated at their closest points by 200 km (125 mi) in southern British Columbia. This and smaller gaps in the species' distribution generally coincide with an absence of suitable high mountain habitat. In the Rocky Mountains alpine larch extends from the Salmon River Mountains of central Idaho, latitude 45° 28' N. northward to latitude 51° 36' N. several kilometers past Lake Louise in Banff National Park, AB. [A fossil larch, probably of this species, grew between 1000 and 1250 A.D. near the Athabasca Glacier (Columbia Icefield) 90 km (56 mi) northwest of today's northernmost known isolated alpine larch tree (18).] Within this distribution, alpine larch is common in the highest areas of the Bitterroot, Anaconda-Pintler, Whitefish, and Cabinet Ranges of western Montana. It is also found in lesser amounts atop numerous other ranges and peaks in western Montana and northern Idaho (4). In British Columbia and Alberta, alpine larch is common along the Continental Divide and adjacent ranges, and in the Purcell and southern Selkirk Ranges. In the Cascade Range alpine larch is found principally east of the Cascade Divide and extends from the Wenatchee Mountains (47° 25' N.) in central Washington northward to about 21 km (13 mi) inside British Columbia (49° 12' N.). Within this limited distribution covering a north-south distance of only 193 km (120 mi), alpine larch is locally abundant in the Wenatchee, Chelan, and Okanogan ranges. - The native range of alpine larch.",Native Range,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Alpine larch is monoecious; male and female flowers (strobili) are borne separately on short, woody spur shoots scattered among the leaf-bearing spur shoots. Strobili are normally monosporangiate. Buds producing the strobili begin to swell by the end of May, and the wind-dispersed pollen is shed from the small yellowish male strobili in June, when there is still several feet of snow on the ground in most stands (2,21,30). Female strobili develop into purplish cones 4 to 5 cm (1.5 to 2.0 in) long by September. Frost damage, especially to female strobili, may account for low seed production in most years. The importance of other factors limiting pollination, fertilization, and seed development is unknown. Seed Production and Dissemination- Large seed crops are infrequent. In Montana they occur about 1 year out of 10, and even modest-sized crops occur in about the same frequency. Appreciable quantities of seed are not produced until trees are at least 80 years old. Dominant trees, several hundred years of age, produce the largest crops. Most of the relatively light, winged seeds fall from the cones in September and are wind disseminated (30). Cleaned seeds number between 231 500 and 359 500/kg (105,000 and 163,000/lb). A heavy seed crop in one area of the Washington Cascades was largely consumed by larvae of an unidentified fly (Diptera) (2). Seedling Development- Germination of alpine larch seed has been poor in several tests but is improved by soaking the seeds for 24 hours in 3 percent hydrogen peroxide solution (8,21,24,30). Such treatment may inhibit root development, however (25). There are usually five cotyledons, although four or six may appear; they are narrow, pointed, and 1.0 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long. Germination is epigeal. First-year germinants of alpine larch are seldom found in natural stands. In one area the smallest seedlings observed were 4 cm (1.6 in) high and proved to be about 10 years old (4). Several cotyledon-stage seedlings were found on an Alberta site in 1977 following a good seed year (21). Small openings in cirques often contain dense, even-aged groves, termed ""reproduction glades,"" of alpine larch seedlings or saplings. This suggests that successful reproduction occurs rarely, and only under ideal conditions. The location of reproduction glades suggests that germination is most successful on a moist mineral soil surface, on northern exposures or in cirques not fully exposed to afternoon sun. Germination probably takes place in July soon after snowmelt. Seedlings and basal branches of saplings have juvenile leaves that last through two summers. Until the plants are 20 to 25 years old, this evergreen, or ""wintergreen,"" foliage constitutes 25 to 30 percent of the total leaf biomass (21,22). Physiological studies suggest that this wintergreen foliage is important for tree establishment because it is less susceptible to drought stress in summer. Height growth is exceedingly slow for the first 20 to 25 years but accelerates rapidly thereafter (21,22). This pattern of early growth apparently allows the seedlings to become well established and develop an extensive root system while still being protected from winter and spring desiccation by the snowpack. This species is very difficult to cultivate even in the relatively cool climates at lower elevations in the Pacific Northwest or in England. Seedlings have been raised at Kew Gardens (12), but they have not grown well, leading to the conclusion that a colder climate than that of Britain is required for alpine larch. Apparently, daytime high temperatures and surface drought are lethal. The species seems to require full light, but low temperatures. Bud dormancy is thought to influence the lack of adaptation to lower elevations (17). Vegetative Reproduction- Subalpine larch does not reproduce from sprouts. Techniques for reproduction from rooted cuttings have not been reported. Layering (rooting of lower branches that are compressed against moist ground) has long been known in some other species of Larix (11) and in its associate, subalpine fir, but alpine larch is known to spread by layering only in a few severely stunted trees or krummholz (4).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Alpine larch is a very slow-growing, long-lived tree. Vigorous saplings 1.2 m (4 ft) tall are about 30 to 35 years of age. Dominant trees attain small to moderate dimensions, depending upon site conditions, in a typical 400- to 500-year life span. Average ages for dominant alpine larch of different diameters are as follows (2): The largest diameter shown is not attained on ""average"" sites. Although from four to five centuries is a common life span for dominant trees, many individuals attain 700 years, and the oldest are estimated to be about 1,000 years (2). Complete ring counts are not possible on the oldest trees because of extensive heart rot. On average sites (high on north-facing slopes) the dominant trees grow 12 to 15 m (40 to 50 ft) in height and 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h. In moist cirque basin sites on granitic or quartzite substrates, dominant trees reach 23 to 29 m (75 to 95 ft) in height and 61 to 124 cm (24 to 49 in) in d.b.h. The largest recorded alpine larch, in the Wenatchee National Forest of Washington State, is 201 cm (79 in) in d.b.h. and 29 m (95 ft) tall (1). The tallest reported alpine larch is an exceptional 46 m (152 ft) in Montana's Cabinet Range (3). Alpine larch typically grows in open, parklike groves, less than 0.2 ha (0.5 acre) in size, interspersed with natural openings of various sizes. Stocking within the small groves is at the rate of 125 to 200 mature trees per hectare (50 to 80/acre) (2). No site index or yield data have been developed for alpine larch stands; however, data from other Montana forest habitat types (20) suggest that annual yield capability would be only about 0.7 to 1.4 m³/ha (10 to 20 ft³/acre) on sites having better than average productivity. Defect is very high for all species in alpine larch communities. Essentially no commercial timber harvesting has been done, even in the best developed stands, nor does any seem likely in the future. ""Poor"" alpine larch sites produce stunted larch generally 5 to 11 m (16 to 36 ft) tall at maturity. Many of these sites lie above the tree line for evergreen conifers and would be classified as alpine tundra were it not for the occurrence of this unusual tree. Rooting Habit- Alpine larch roots extend deep into fissures in the rocky substrate. Trees are well anchored by a large taproot and large lateral roots and are very windfirm. The crown and trunk of old trees may break off in violent winds, but the tree itself is seldom uprooted. Richards (21) found that subalpine larch ""seedlings"" 16 to 25 years old and only 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) tall had taproots penetrating 40 to 60 cm (16 to 24 in) and laterals descending 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24 in) at about 45° from the horizontal. Mycorrhizal development was found on all trees, but shallow roots had a higher degree of mycorrhizal association than deep roots. Cenococum graniforme has been identified as an ectotrophic mycorrhiza of subalpine larch (29). Reaction to Competition- Alpine larch is the most shade-intolerant conifer growing at these high elevation sites and is classed as very intolerant. Its evergreen associates attain their best development in forests below the lower limits of larch. An exception is whitebark pine, another timberline inhabitant, which, however, is most abundant on warm exposures and microsites and thus tends to complement rather than compete with larch (4). Alpine larch foliage requires higher light intensities than its evergreen associates to maintain active growth through photosynthesis (21,22). Thus it is unable to compete with a vigorous growth of evergreens. Instead, alpine larch owes its existence to its superior hardiness, especially on cool exposures. At the highest elevations alpine larch fills a vacant niche and represents the potential climax. The larch's ability to grow at higher elevations than evergreen conifers on certain sites is partly related to its superior resistance to winter desiccation-dehydration of foliage during warm, sunny periods when the roots are still frozen or chilled (21,22). Winter desiccation in conjunction with lack of summer warmth are thought to be primary factors limiting the ascent of tree growth on high mountains (5,28). Above the limit of trees, the growing season is so short that new growth cannot adequately harden-off (fully developed cuticle), and thus it succumbs to desiccation in winter. Alpine larch is less vulnerable to winter desiccation than its associated conifers because its leaves are deciduous and its buds are woody and protected (2,21). Thus there is little tendency for larch to grow in a shrubby or krummholz form, unlike its evergreen associates. Its deciduous foliage requires a large amount of moisture throughout the summer compared to the evergreens; consequently, it occupies relatively moist sites. In the middle of its zone of occurrence [between ""forest line,"" the general upper limit of contiguous forest, and ""tree line,"" the general limit of erect evergreen conifers (5)], natural openings and severe climate allow alpine larch to share climax status with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and whitebark pine. These evergreens often develop in the shelter of a large ""patriarch"" larch, sometimes growing up through the larch crown as if it were a trellis. On the better sites where alpine larch grows, subalpine fir is the potential climax dominant. Engelmann spruce is usually a minor component of stands containing subalpine larch; it often attains large size but, unlike subalpine fir, seldom regenerates abundantly. Occasionally alpine larch seeds in and regenerates on a burned area within the subalpine forest, 100 to 150 m (330 to 490 ft) below its usual elevational limits. But the species grows more slowly than the accompanying lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and is crowded out by that species and by subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. Damaging Agents- Violent winds in alpine larch stands often damage crowns in conjunction with loads of clinging ice or wet snow. Nevertheless this tree's deciduous habit and supple limbs make it more resistant to wind damage than its associates. Death usually occurs when advanced heart rot has so weakened the bole that high winds break off the trunk. The quinine fungus (Fomitopsis officinalis), which causes brown trunk rot, produces the only conks commonly found on living trunks. This fungus is evidently the source of most heart rot. Other diseases and insects generally cause little damage to alpine larch. Needle blight fungi, Sarcotrochila alpina, has severely infected trees on Mount Frosty in Manning Provincial Park, BC (33). Needle cast fungi, Lophodermiurn laricinum, have also been reported on alpine larch. Alpine larch is listed as a host of two fungi, Lachnellula occidentalis and L. suecica (13), which may be capable of causing stem cankers, but neither has been noted as a serious disease problem. Isolated witches'-brooms (dense branch-clusters with associated branch swelling) are found widely scattered in alpine larch stands. These could be caused by dwarf mistletoe, fungal infection, or perhaps even genetic aberration. The western larch dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium laricis was reported in two early 1900's collections on alpine larch, but its status on this species is poorly known (14). Snow avalanches and snowslides are an important source of damage in many stands, but again this species is better adapted to survive these disturbances than its evergreen associates. Alpine larch poles up to 13 cm (5 in) thick and 6 m (20 ft) tall can survive annual flattening by snowslides only to straighten again when the snow melts in summer (4). As larch poles exceed this size their strong trunks and lack of dense foliage make them resistant to breakage in snowslides. Because of this superior resistance, alpine larch often occupies snowslide sites (forming a ""disclimax"" because of disturbance) within the subalpine forest proper. Fire is an occasional but quite localized cause of injury or death in alpine larch stands. Large fires are infrequent in these cool, moist, and rocky sites where fire spreads poorly because of the light and discontinuous fuels. Unlike its thick-barked, fire resistant relative, western larch (Larix occidentalis), alpine larch has thin bark and has low resistance to surface fire.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,14,1
"Although soil development in alpine larch stands varies, most soils are immature. Generally alpine larch sites have undergone intense alpine glaciation during the Pleistocene and have been deglaciated for less than 12,000 years. Chemical weathering is retarded by the short, cool summer season. Also, nitrogen-fixing and other microbiotic activity that might enrich the soil is apparently restricted by low soil temperatures and high acidity. Throughout its distribution, alpine larch commonly grows on slopes covered with granite or quartzite talus (boulders), which have not been previously occupied by vascular plants. The species also grows in cracks in massive bedrock. These undeveloped soils would probably be classified (31) as fragmental and as loamy skeletal families within the order Entisols (Cryorthents). Such substrates have been referred to as azonal soils, and more specifically as Lithosols in earlier classifications. On sites that have appreciable soil development or fine material (including recent moraines), the soils are still rocky and immature. These would be classified as Inceptisols-usually Typic Cryochrepts (17). On some sheltered slopes, deposits of volcanic ash in soil profiles are sufficiently thick to require recognition as Andic Cryochrepts, in a medial over loamy skeletal family (15). Some of the best-developed ash-layered soils beneath alpine larch stands are Typic Cryandepts, which nearly fit the description of zonal Brown Podzolic soils in high elevation forests given by Nimlos (19). These soils are strongly acidic and have a distinct, well-developed cambic B horizon. Throughout the range of alpine larch, pH values were found to be very acidic, ranging from 3.9 to 5.7 in the mineral soil (B horizon) (2). Bitterroot Range sites had an average pH of 4.6. Such strongly acid, shallow, rocky, and cold soils are extremely infertile. Alpine larch grows on several types of geologic substrates but has an affinity for acidic rock types, being most abundant on granitic and quartzite substrates and absent or scarce on nearby limestone or dolomite (4,21). This distribution contrasts markedly with that of several other cold-climate conifers, including Siberian larch (L. sibirica) and tamarack (L. laricina), which often grow on basic, calcium-rich sites (16,23). Alpine larch achieves its best growth in high cirque basins and near the base of talus slopes where the soils are kept moist throughout the summer by aerated seep water. It can also tolerate boggy wet-meadow sites having very acidic organic soils. The species is most abundant on cool, north-facing slopes and high basins where it forms the uppermost band of forest. It also covers broad ridgetops and grows locally under relatively moist soil conditions on south-facing slopes. In the Canadian Rockies, where summer rainfall is more abundant, it is often found on south slopes. The extreme lower and upper altitudinal limits of subalpine larch, over its entire geographic range, are apparently 1520 and 3020 m (5,000 and 9,900 ft). The lowermost individuals are found in shady cirques and canyons in the North Cascades, while the highest limits apply to scattered stunted trees on Trapper Peak in the Montana Bitterroot Range (2). In the Bitterroot Range, alpine larch is abundant above 2290 m (7,500 ft) on northern exposures. It extends lowest on north-facing talus slopes, free from other competing conifers. But, even when moist, open, boulder-covered slopes extend down the mountainsides to the 1370 m (4,500 ft) canyon bottoms, alpine larch rarely colonizes them below 1980 m (6,500 ft). In the Anaconda-Pintler Range of southwestern Montana, alpine larch forms a narrow band between elevations of about 2560 and 2800 m (8,400 to 9,200 ft). Northward in the Rockies, the elevation of its timberlines decreases gradually. Stands in northwestern Montana, Alberta, and southeastern British Columbia are generally found between 1980 and 2380 m (6,500 and 7,800 ft) and in the northern Cascades, between 1830 and 2290 m (6,000 and 7,500 ft).",Soils and Topography,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,15,1
"Alpine larch's primary values seem to be in watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and outdoor recreation and esthetics. The ability of this larch to occupy steep north slopes and snow chutes where other trees scarcely grow suggests that it helps to stabilize snow loads and reduce the severity of avalanches (27). Scientists from several countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Japan, and New Zealand) who are interested in avalanche control or forest establishment on cold sites have obtained alpine larch seed from the USDA Forest Service. A diverse assemblage of birds and mammals is associated with alpine larch communities (2). Grizzly bears often dig winter dens in alpine larch stands in Banff National Park (32). The greatest use of these habitats by most wildlife species is as summer range, when timberline vegetation is succulent, temperatures cool, and water abundant. Mountain goats, bighorn sheep, hoary marmots, pikas, mule deer, elk (wapiti), black and grizzly bears, red squirrels, and snowshoe hares are among the mammals that feed in alpine larch stands. Blue grouse apparently feed heavily on alpine larch needles. The trees provide some concealment and thermal cover in an otherwise open habitat. Woodpeckers and other cavity-nesting birds and mammals nest in the larger, hollow-trunk trees. Hikers and photographers are attracted by the natural beauty of alpine larch stands. The tree's foliage is a translucent bright green in summer and turns lemon yellow and finally golden in September before it falls in October. The unusual hardiness of this species, its adaptations to survival in a harsh climate, on rugged topography and sterile substrates, should make it of special interest for scientific study and for reclamation plantings on high-elevation sites.",Special Uses,Alpine Larch,larix,lyallii,conifer,16,1
"American basswood grows in mixture with other species and only rarely forms pure stands. It is dominant in a single forest type, Sugar Maple-Basswood (Society of American Foresters Type 26). This cover type is most common in central Minnesota and western Wisconsin but is represented elsewhere from central Illinois, northward to southern Ontario and Quebec, eastward to northwestern Ohio, and westward along valley slopes of the prairie-forest transition (15). Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) dominates both overstory and understory layers, with basswood achieving the position of second dominant in the tree layer. Common associates are white ash (Fraxinus americana), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), red maple (Acer rubrum), and American elm (Ulmus americana). Although not a dominant species, basswood is also found in the following forest cover types: 21 Eastern White Pine 23 Eastern Hemlock 20 White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple 24 Hemlock-Yellow Birch 27 Sugar Maple 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 28 Black Cherry-Maple 60 Beech-Sugar Maple 39 Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple 42 Bur Oak 58 Yellow-Poplar-Eastern Hemlock 62 Silver Maple-American Elm Basswood is one of the major species, with sugar maple, beech (Fagus), ash (Fraxinus), hickory (Carya), and oak (Quercus), in the Deciduous Forest Region of southern Ontario. It is a minor component of the sugar maple-yellow birch-hemlock-white pine climax forest type in the southern districts of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence regions of Ontario (32). In the Mixed Mesophytic forests of the southern Appalachians, Tilia americana is replaced by T. heterophylla (9).

The northern limit of basswood approximates the -18° to -17° C (0° to 2° F) isotherm for mean daily minimum January temperature. Basswood reaches its maximum development in areas averaging 18° to 27° C (65° to 80° F) in July and receiving 250 to 380 mm (10 to 15 in) of precipitation during the growing season.

"The number of native taxa in the genus Tilia has been debated for some time. As many as 15 native species and 13 varieties are named in early taxonomic work. Only three species of Tilia are now recognized in the United States, T.americana L., T. caroliniana Mill., and T. heterophylla Vent. (24). Recent studies, however, suggest that the genus Tilia in eastern North America should be considered a single, but highly variable, species.

"Flowering and Fruiting- The fragrant, yellow-white, perfect flowers are borne on loose cymes on long stalks attached to leafy bracts. Flowering generally occurs in June but can begin in late May or early July, depending on latitude and annual variations in temperature. Flowering follows initial leaf-out and lasts approximately 2 weeks. During this period, all stages of floral development are present on a single tree or even in a single inflorescence (4 to 40 flowers per inflorescence). The flowers attract a number of insect pollinators. In a study of the pollination biology, 66 species of insects from 29 families were identified as pollinators of Tilia flowers. Bees and flies were the most common diurnal pollinators; moths were the primary nocturnal visitors (2). The fruit, a nutlike drupe 5 to 10 mm (0.2 to 0.4 in) in diameter, usually contains one seed but in collections from both open- and forest-grown trees, 12 percent of the fruit contained two seeds and less than 1 percent contained three seeds. The seeds have a crustaceous seed coat (testa), a fleshy yellowish endosperm, and a well-developed embryo. A variety of forms of fruit and seed have been noted, including egg-shaped, round, onion-shaped, conical, and pentagonal (34). Individual trees tend to consistently produce fruit of a particular form and size. Seed Production and Dissemination- Fruits ripen in September and October and are soon dispersed by such mechanisms as wind, gravity, and animals. Although the flower bracts are reported to aid in wind dispersal, fruits rarely are carried more than one or two tree lengths from the parent (24). In addition to their limited role in seed dispersal, bracts may act as ""flags"" to attract pollinators (especially nocturnal ones) to the inflorescences (2). Animals probably increase the seed dispersal significantly. The seed-bearing age for basswood generally ranges from 15 to 100 years, but seed production at age 8 years (10 years from seed) has been noted (45). The number of ripened fruits averages 9,700 to 13,200/kg (4,400 to 6,000/lb); green fruit averages 5,070 to 5,950 seeds per kilogram (2,300 to 2,700/lb) of fruit (17,33,35). Based on a number of collections, seed weights varied from 12 to 38 mg (0.18 to 0.59 gr) and averaged 31 mg (0.48 gr) (4). In a study for 26 years of 19 species in northern Wisconsin, basswood was one of the most consistent fall-maturing seed producers (18). It produced good seed crops 62 percent of the time from 1949 to 1974. When crown-released, basswood that were about 50 years old did not increase their fruit production during the 5-year period following release. Moreover, the quality of fruit remained poor throughout this period. In the third year after release, for example, only 5 percent of the fruit collected from the ground contained sound seed (37). The production of fruit without seed (parthenocarpy) and seed infestation by a lepidopterous larva are two common defects that affect seed viability. A pin hole in the pericarp indicates the presence of the larvae. The percentage of fruits with the pin hole was 3 percent in a September collection and 7 percent for an October collection in southeastern Ontario (35); 30 percent of fruits were insect infested in 45 collections from various parts of the natural range of basswood (4). In the same collections, the percentage of fruits with seed ranged from 0 to nearly 100, but the lack of sound seed on the forest floor seems to be the rule. Only 2 percent were sound out of more than 7,400 identifiable basswood seeds found in the litter in a northern Wisconsin stand. Seeds covered by leaves had rotted and most of the seeds lying on or in the upper litter layers had been destroyed by rodents (18). Seedling Development- Basswood seeds show a pronounced dormancy and generally germinate poorly regardless of seedbed conditions. The primary cause for the lack of quick germination is an impermeable testa. Using organic acids to digest the pericarps of the fruits and to render the testas permeable improves germination (17). Correctly treated seeds commonly average from 20 to 30 percent germination following stratification at 2° to 5° C (36° to 41° F) for 110 to 130 days. Germination is epigeal. Early harvesting followed by immediate sowing has also been suggested for overcoming dormancy of basswood seeds. Collections should be made when seed coats turn brown but before they become dry and hard, or more specifically, when the moisture content is 20 to 40 percent of the green weight (7,29). Shading aids the establishment and initial survival of basswood seedlings but heavy shade limits subsequent growth and development, and vigorous growth is unlikely under the forest canopy. Likewise, higher soil temperatures found in forest openings are suitable for greatest growth of basswood seedlings (3). Basswood seedlings first develop a long taproot, which is soon supplemented by lateral roots. First-year seedlings had a root penetration of 20.3 cm (8 in) with a lateral spread of 7.6 cm (3 in), and second-year seedlings had a root penetration of 21.3 cm (8.4 in) and a lateral spread of 18.3 cm (7.2 in) (30). Stem height was 5.6 cm (2.2 in) the first year and 9.4 cm (3.7 in) the second year. Cold storage of autumn-lifted basswood seedlings maintains root growth capacity and overall seedling vigor for spring planting. Autumn-lifted stock should be stored at a temperature of 5° C (41° F) and a relative humidity of 70-85 percent (46). Basswood has been successfully planted in Ontario on cutover land and abandoned farmland. On cutover land, survival was best when a light overhead canopy (8.0 m/ha or 35 ft/acre of residual basal area) controlled competing vegetation (36). Release of the seedlings from the residual overstory and undergrowth was recommended after three growing seasons. Fall plantings failed to survive. Early failures of hardwoods planted on old-field sites in Ontario have been attributed to the absence of mycorrhizal fungi (30), insufficient site preparation, and insufficient postplanting weed control (42,44). Fertilization at the time of planting had little effect on seedling survival or growth (43). Vegetative Reproduction- Basswood sprouts prolifically, and this vegetative regeneration can be managed for sawtimber. Sprouts commonly originate on the stump at the ground line, and vigorous sprouts occur over a wide range of diameter classes (31). Almost all trees 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and smaller will produce sprouts and more than half of sawlog-size trees can be expected to produce stump sprouts (23). However, early thinning of stump sprouts (preferably before they reach 5 cm (2 in) d.b.h. or about age 10) is needed to ensure both good quality and rapid growth. Clumps should be thinned to not more than two stems; such thinnings will reduce the incidence of stem degrade due to decay, seams, and sweep (23,38). Because an extensive root system already exists, a basswood sprout has a higher probability of replacing a parent stem than does a sugar maple seedling. Thus, the ability to produce abundant stump sprouts allows basswood to maintain itself in a stand with the more shade-tolerant maple despite the much larger numbers of sugar maple in the subcanopy (13).",Reproduction and Early Growth,American Basswood,tilia,americana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- This species reaches a height of 23 to 40 m (75 to 130 ft) with a d.b.h. of 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in). Under favorable conditions, trees sometimes attain a height of 43 m (140 ft) and a d.b.h. of 137 cm (54 in). Estimates of maximum longevity generally exceed 200 years. Basswood grows faster than most other northern hardwood species. On the same site, basswood often exceeds sugar maple and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) in site index by 1.5 rn (5 ft) and beech by 3 rn (10 ft) (11). Diameter growth for basswood averaged 3 mm. (0.11 in) per year in three unmanaged stands in northeastern Wisconsin (site index at base age 50 years for basswood of 21.3 m or 70 ft). The same site under managed conditions produced substantially higher growth rates. Annual diameter growth average for a crop tree release was 4.6 mm (0.18 in); for a 20.7 m² and 17.2 m² /ha (90 ft² and 75 ft² /acre) (residual sawtimber) selection cut, it was 3.8 and 4.8 mm (0.15, 0.19 in); and for a group selection cut, it was 3 mm (0.12 in). Relatively narrow bark ridges and V-shaped fissures, with new light-colored inner bark visible in the fissures, represent a high-vigor basswood. In contrast, low-vigor trees have scaly bark with wide bark ridges and shallow, short fissures, frequently producing a rather smooth surface (12). Two phases can be noted in the renewal of cambial activity for basswood. The first phase is the reactivity of cambium that occurs independently of the initial meristematic activity within the overwintering buds. The second phase, accelerating cambial activity after bud-break, is presumably under the influence of primary growth (14). Winter stem contraction for basswood often exceeds stem expansion from the previous growing season. The amount of winter shrinkage in basswood stems was greater than that of yellow birch, sugar maple, or hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) (49). The period of shoot elongation for basswood in northern areas is shorter than that for other hardwoods-only red oak and sugar maple had shorter periods of terminal shoot elongation among seven species studied in northern Wisconsin. Based on an average of three growing seasons, shoot elongation for basswood began in May and was completed by the first of June (10). Longer periods of shoot elongation have been noted for open-grown basswood in Illinois and basswood plantations in Ontario (mid-May to mid-August). Chlorophyll is found in xylem rays and primary xylem of basswood twigs (47). Although the photosynthetic contribution is not large, it may have seasonal significance when leaves are absent. Rooting Habit- The initial taproot observed in basswood seedlings gives way in saplings to a system of lateral roots (5). This early root development is gradually obscured by the intensive development of oblique roots in the central mass, and surface lateral roots extend out from this mass (16). Adventitious roots have developed on the lower stem of basswood engulfed by dune sand (4). Reaction to Competition- Although basswood is less shade tolerant than its common associate, sugar maple, vigorous sprouting and rapid sprout growth allow it to persist under the selection system. Overall, American basswood is most accurately classed as tolerant of shade. This great sprouting vigor also helps it compete with the abundant regrowth following clearcutting. On an excellent site in the central Appalachian hardwoods, basswood was second only to sugar maple in number of stems 7 years after clearcutting. On a good site and a fair site, however, basswood was not among the five most numerous species during the same period (39). For reproduction from seed, the shelterwood system should provide the partial shade necessary to control competing vegetation, and to create a microclimate suitable for germination. After basswood is established, the overstory should be removed. Closely spaced, forest-grown trees develop straight, columnar trunks and narrow crowns, but open-grown trees have short stems and many large branches. Damaging Agents- Basswood plantations established on weed-infested old-field sites are susceptible to girdling by mice and voles, and completely girdled trees die. In a southern Ontario plantation, 44 percent of the basswood stems were completely girdled and 39 percent were partially girdled (41). The species responsible for the girdling, the meadow vole, does most of this damage feeding beneath the snow. Rabbits also feed heavily on seedlings and small saplings in both plantations and natural stands. Basswood seeds are eaten by mice, squirrels, and chipmunks, thus reducing the chances of seedling establishment. Many different insects attack basswood, but few serious insect problems exist. The linden borer (Saperda vestita) makes long, irregular tunnels, particularly at the base of the tree, and may damage weak, very young, or overmature trees. Local infestations of defoliators may occur. The primary ones include the linden looper (Erannis tiliaria), basswood leafminer (Baliosus nervosus), spring cankerworm (Paleacrita vernata), fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), whitemarked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) (1,22). In New England, American basswood is a highly preferred host for gypsy moth (21), while in southern Quebec, it was classified as intermediate in susceptibility to gypsy moth defoliation (27). The foliage is host to various diseases-anthracnose (Gnomonia tiliae), black mold (Fumago vagans), and leaf spot (Cercospora microsora)-but none seem to do serious damage. The wood of basswood decays easily and once exposed can be host to many of the common hardwood decay organisms such as the yellow cap fungi (Pholiota limonella) and Collybia velutipes. Phellinus igniarius, Ustulina deusta, and nectria canker (Nectria galligena) also are found on basswood. Little defect is encountered in basswood when harvested before it reaches 120 years of age. Beyond this age, the chances of losses due to decay are greatly increased. Cull studies in the forests of Ontario indicate that yellow-brown stringy rot was the most common bole defect encountered; brown stain, some incipient yellow rot, and green stain were also found (8). The thin bark of this species is easily damaged by fire (13). Basswood is one of the hardwoods least susceptible to late spring frosts (40).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,American Basswood,tilia,americana,hardwood,14,0
"Studies relating to the presence of basswood to soil characteristics in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan indicate that stands in which basswood shared dominance were generally confined to sandy loams, loams, or silt loams, with basswood obtaining maximum development on the finer textured soils. Most soils were classified as Hapludalfs within the Alfisols order, although some Eutrochrepts (Inceptisols), Cryandepts (Inceptisols), mesic families of entic Fragiorthods (Spodosols), and Haplorthods (Spodosols) were noted. Basswood grows best on mesic sites, but it is also found on coarse soils such as the sand dunes near Lake Michigan (17) and on dry, exposed rock ridges in Ontario and Quebec (25). The species grows on soils ranging in pH from 4.5 to 7.5 but occurs more often in the less acidic to slightly basic part of this range. In fact, calcareous soils have been associated with the presence of basswood (9,17). The importance of aspect and edaphic factors to local distribution is reflected by the restriction of basswood throughout much of its range to moist sites on north- and east-facing slopes. Maple-basswood forests in southern Wisconsin are largely restricted to northerly exposures (19). Basswood is restricted to more mesic sites in southern Illinois and in northern Kentucky (5). At the western limit of its range, basswood frequently grows on the eastern side of lakes and along major drainages. This localized growth is often ascribed to fire protection. Although lack of fire may be a reason for the persistence of a fire-sensitive species such as basswood, presence and distribution are controlled more by soil moisture and the ameliorating effects of water on the local climate. Basswood is classified as a nitrogen-demanding species because it grows poorly on sites deficient in nitrogen. With increasing nitrogen supplies, basswood growth increases markedly, approaching a maximum radial increment when 560 to 670 kg/ha (500 to 600 lb/acre) of nitrogen are added. Basswood leaves have high contents of nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, and potassium at the time of leaf fall and they contribute most of these nutrients to the forest floor (13,28).",Soils and Topography,American Basswood,tilia,americana,hardwood,15,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- In the Northern and Central States, beech flowers appear in late April or early May when the leaves are about one-third grown; the species is monoecious. The flowers are quite vulnerable to spring frosts. Male flowers occur in long-stemmed heads; female flowers in clusters of two to four (40). Beechnuts require one growing season to mature and they ripen between September and November. Two or (rarely) three nuts may be found within a single bur. The first nuts to fall are usually wormy or aborted. Seed fall begins after the first heavy frosts have caused the burs to open and is completed within a few weeks. Some empty burs remain on the trees throughout the winter. Seed Production and Dissemination- Beech ordinarily begins to produce a substantial amount of seeds when about 40 years old, and by the time it is 60 years old may produce large quantities. Good beech seed crops are produced at 2- to 8-year intervals (40). Beech seeds, averaging about 3,500/kg (1,600/lb), are relatively heavy. Most of the seeds simply drop to the ground under the parent trees. Rodents may carry some of them short distances and on steep terrain a few may roll down slopes, but dispersal is quite restricted. Bluejays may transport many beech seeds several kilometers (16,17). Seedling Development- Beech seeds germinate from early spring to early summer. Germination is epigeous and chilling is required to break dormancy. On either mineral soil or leaf litter, germination is good, but on excessively wet sites it is poor. Both germination and survival tend to be better on mor humus than on mull humus soil (39,40). Beech seedlings develop better under a moderate canopy or in protected small openings than they do on larger open areas where the surface soil may dry out below the depth of the shallow roots. Height growth of seedlings is about the same in dense (87 percent) or moderate (55 percent) shade, but total dry weight and root development are greatest under moderate shade. Height growth, dry weight, and root development in the open are less than in shade (25). Seedlings are found in large numbers beneath even the densest stands, but under such conditions their growth is slow. Beech reproduction can start under, and come through, fern and raspberry cover. Dormancy of beech seedlings can be broken in spring and growth can be prolonged in fall by supplemental light. Decreasing day length plays the major role in inducing dormancy in the fall, but day length may be secondary to temperature in controlling resumption of growth in the spring. That is, day length probably becomes adequate for growth to resume in the spring before temperatures are high enough for growth to occur. Temperature, therefore, exerts the final control over growth resumption. Beech continues growing all winter in a greenhouse when daylight is supplemented by continuous artificial light. The height of beech seedlings growing in the intense competition of a virgin hemlock-hardwood stand in northern Pennsylvania (39) was as follows: When forest stands are heavily cut, beech reproduction tends to grow more slowly than that of most associated hardwood species. This is especially true in clearcuttings. Here the beech reproduction may be overtopped by less tolerant species, such as the birches and white ash (Fraxinus americana), that respond vigorously to increased light. A number of studies have shown that heavy cutting or clearcutting results in fewer beech in the new stand than in the old (39). Repeated clearcutting on short rotations may nearly eliminate beech. Under partial cuttings, especially single-tree selection cuttings, intolerant species offer little competition and the tolerant beech reproduction is able to develop. The beech may be further favored by its virtual immunity to deer browsing. Vegetative Reproduction- Beech sprouts well from the stumps of young trees, but this ability diminishes after trees reach 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. Sprouts from stumps 25 cm to 38 cm (10 to 15 in) in diameter usually are short lived and do not attain tree stature. Numerous sprouts may develop on the trunk of beech immediately below a wound, and from the tops of stumps; here adventitious buds develop in callus tissue of the cambial region. Beech trees may develop large numbers of root sprouts or suckers. Studies (30) have shown that reproduction is almost exclusively by suckering in the ""beech gaps"" and is abundant in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, in Maine (13), and in many other areas, often those near the northern and western limits of its range (11,42) where environments are severe (27). Suckering is stimulated only slightly by removal of the stem (18). Injury to roots appears to be necessary for the initiation of root sprouts in beech (19). Root sprouts arise from adventitious buds that form within callus tissues associated with wounds. Experimental injuries to roots in November resulted in fewer sprouts than did injuries inflicted in spring (20). Sometimes root sprouts develop where no apparent injury has occurred (39). There were relatively more root sprouts on southerly slopes in areas where freeze-thaw action tended to injure shallow or exposed roots and stimulate sprout formation, and where late spring frosts tended to injure or kill young seedlings. In Ohio, seedling regeneration was positively associated with northerly exposures and root sprout regeneration with southerly exposures (11). In an undisturbed stand of mature beech in the Adirondacks, 1,730 to 2,220 root sprouts per hectare (700 to 900/acre; 7 to 12/tree) were counted (39). Casual observations elsewhere indicate that the number per tree may greatly exceed this figure. Root sprouts can develop into desirable trees. Isozyme genetic studies have shown that some groups of overstory beech trees with similar phenotypic traits are clones (14). Sometimes root sprouts are ephemeral. In one reproduction study, made after a 60-year-old stand of beech was cut, all of the root sprouts died within 4 years. On the other hand, the trees in a 40-year-old beech stand of sprout origin averaged 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. and 11.6 in (38 ft) in height. Beech limbs root in a single year when layered. Interspecific root grafting is common.",Reproduction and Early Growth,American Beech,fagus,grandifolia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Beech's period of radial growth may continue for 80 to 89 days in the Georgia Piedmont and for approximately 60 days in Indiana (39). Annual height growth of beech saplings is complete in about 60 days; 90 percent of this growth occurs between May 10 and June 10, American beech has a lower site index than any associated hardwood in the northern Lake States. The radial growth period is influenced by available soil moisture. Under normal conditions, it may end in the middle of July, but drought may end it in mid-June. A few individual trees may continue their growth into August and September. In dry years, annual rings may not grow in the basal sections of some beech trees. In general, radial growth of beech begins when the leaves are fully expanded. The annual diameter increment of beech of pole and small saw-log size averages from around 1.8 to 2.3 mm (0.07 to 0.09 in) in undisturbed second-growth stands to 3.8 to 4.8 min (0.15 to 0.19 in) in trees released by partial cuttings (35,39). Annual growth of poles for 5 years after heavy release, leaving from 1.1 to 4.6 m/ha (5 to 20 W/acre) of basal area, ranged from 5.6 mm (0.22 in) to 7.6 min (0.30 in); growth was better in the most heavily stocked stands and on trees with good crown development (26). Under optimum conditions, beech trees may become 37 in (120 ft) high; however, they generally average 18 to 24 in (60 to 80 ft). Growth data for beech in the Lake States are shown in table 1. Among 12 broad-leaved species rated according to their longevity, beech was exceeded only by white oak and sugar maple. Beech trees older than 366 years have been found in Pennsylvania. The distribution of numbers of trees by age is ""J"" shaped, typical of tolerant long-lived species (21). One of the largest beeches on record, growing in Michigan, is 135 cm (53.2 in) in d.b.h., 49 m (161 ft) tall, and has a crown 32 in (105 ft) wide. Beech trees prune themselves in well-stocked stands. Open-grown trees, however, develop short, thick trunks with large, low, spreading limbs terminating in slender, somewhat drooping branches that form a broad, round-topped head. Beech trees that have been injured or suddenly exposed by stand cuttings often develop epicormic branches. In one stand where 65 percent of the basal area had been cut, 40 percent of the remaining beech trees had epicormic branches 5 years later, whereas in a similar but uncut stand, only 17 percent of the trees had such branches (39). Epicormic branching of beech trees has also been observed after glaze damage and after low-temperature injury (27). One report on winter injury showed epicormic branches to be restricted largely to trees with d.b.h. of 10 cm (4 in) or less (2). Rooting Habit- Young seedlings have a taproot that gives way to a heart root system as the tree matures (41). The root system is generally shallow but may penetrate to 1.5 m (5 ft) or more in deep soils. The fine roots form a dense mat in our soil types. Beech root systems are more shallow than the associated yellow birch and sugar maple. Few tree species are less tolerant of flooding during the growing season than American beech. Root exudates of beech contain more organic acids than those of sugar maple or yellow birch. Reaction to Competition- Beech is classed as very tolerant of shade. In some parts of its range, beech is the most tolerant species. Its tolerance is partly due to its very low respiration rate (24) and the quick response of the stomata, which open when light suddenly increases and rapidly close when light intensity diminishes. Beech stomata are more responsive than those of red maple, red oak Quercus rubra), or yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), which are less tolerant (43). On very poor soils or in very cold climates, beech may be less tolerant. The tolerances of beech and associated sugar maple are about the same (25), although locally one species or the other may predominate in the forest understory. Factors other than the ability to endure shade appear to govern the relative success of beech and its common tolerant competition, sugar maple, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Beech may be more competitive under somewhat adverse site and climate conditions (39). Beech and sugar maple are recognized as climatic climax species in the northern hardwood types of the Northeast, Lake States, and Appalachian Mountains. In the Southeast, relict areas of beech suggest that an original maple-beech association has been displaced by the once subclimax oak-hickory community. Damaging Agents- In regions with low winter temperatures, long frost cracks often appear in the tree trunks. These cracks are sometimes superficial but sometimes extend deep into the bole. In the Northeast, beech has been damaged or killed by temperatures of -40° to -45° C (-40° to -50° F) preceded by severe droughts (39). Injured trees died the following summer and winter. Beech can be severely damaged by late spring frosts. In a Kentucky study of effects of flooding, beech was one of the more sensitive species. Beech trees were killed by 2 weeks of submergence of their root crowns in summer. An 18-day period of flooding in winter had no apparent adverse effect, however. Beech's susceptibility to glaze-storm breakage is no greater than that of its associated hardwoods and may be somewhat less than the average for a mixed stand (39). Except on shallow soils, beech is rather windfirm. The thin bark of beech renders it highly vulnerable to injury by fire (large shallow roots are especially vulnerable), sunscald, logging, pruning, or disease. When large branches are broken they heal comparatively slowly (38) and serve as entrance courts for a host of decay fungi (12,32). More than 70 decay fungi (a record for a hardwood species) have been reported for beech (12). The most important include Daedalea unicolor, Ganoderma applanatum, Fomes fomentarius, Phellinus igniarius, Hericium erinaceus, H. coralloides, Steccherinum septentrionale, Inonotus glomeratus, and Ustilina vulgaris. The shoestring fungus, Armillaria sp., the most important root pathogen, attacks and girdles roots of weakened trees. Beech roots are also parasitized by the broomrapes, Conopholis americana and Epifagus virginiana. The latter, beech drops, is specific to beech (8,34). The thinness of beech bark also makes it vulnerable to an unusually large number of sucking insects, including the beech blight aphid, Fagiphagus imbricator, and the giant bark aphid, Longistigma caryae. Continuous heavy outbreaks of the oystershell scale, Lepidosaphes u1mi, have resulted in severe crown dieback and even in the death of entire stands (1). Xylococculus betulae, another scale, causes roughened spots on stems of young trees and is especially devastating to the sprout thickets that have emerged in the aftermath of beech bark disease , the most serious problem of this species (13,31). Beech bark disease is initiated when yet another scale insect, the beech scale, Cryptococcus fagisuga, attacks the bark of beech trees and renders it susceptible to bark canker fungi of the genus Nectria (3,33). The insect component of this scale-Nectria ""complex"" was introduced to Nova Scotia from Europe around 1890 and is now found throughout New England, New York (15) and northern Pennsylvania (37). In 1981, a 70,000-acre infestation was detected in northeastern West Virginia, many miles south of the nearest previously known infestation (28). More recently, the disease has been reported as far west as Toronto, Ontario, and the scale is now present in northeastern Ohio and northwestern Virginia (29). In North America, Nectria coccinea var. faginata is the fungus most commonly associated with the disease in the Maritime Provinces, New England, and northern New York. In western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and some New York stands however, N. galligena is the predominant associated species. As the disease and forest interact for the first time, mortality may be so severe that a large proportion of the big, mature beech trees are killed. Mortality is now especially high in some southern and western areas of the Adirondack Mountain region. The percent stocking of beech was reported (7) to remain the same after the killing front of the beech bark disease moved through a managed stand; the disease mainly affected the larger trees. Although such mortality is rare in stands emerging in the aftermath of the disease, severe defect may be caused by the now-endemic causal complex together with Xylococculus betulae (13). Defoliation by insects can occasionally be a serious problem (1). The most damaging is the saddled prominent, Heterocampa guttivitta, although the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), fall cankerworm. (Alsophila pometaria), and the Bruce spanworm. (Operophtera bruceata) occasionally cause heavy defoliation in local areas. Insect defoliation often renders trees susceptible to attack by the shoestring root fungus. Beech is seldom severely browsed by white-tailed deer. When other, more desirable tree species are available, beech is usually nipped only sparingly (36).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,American Beech,fagus,grandifolia,hardwood,14,0
"Beech is found generally within two principal soil groups: the gray-brown podzolic (Hapludalf) and the laterite (Acrorthox) and is prevalent on podzols; it is seldom found on limestone soils except at the western edge of its range. These soils are contained in the orders Alfisols, Oxisols, and Spodosols. Soils of loamy texture and those with a high humus content are more favorable than lighter soils (39). The largest trees are found in the alluvial bottom lands of the Ohio and the lower Mississippi River valleys, and along the western slopes of the southern Appalachian Mountains. Beech populations frequently are higher on coarse-textured, dry-mesic soils in the northern part of its range (38). In Indiana, beech is more sensitive to reduced soil moisture than is white oak (Quercus alba), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American elm (Ulmus americana), and slippery elm (U. rubra). It will grow on poorly drained sites not subjected to prolonged flooding and may grow where the water table is within 15 cm to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) of the surface. It is markedly less tolerant of such conditions than are red maple (Acer rubrum) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). Beech trees on poorly drained sites have shallower root systems than those on better drained sites (39). 'Ember stands containing considerable numbers of beech are found on soils ranging from pH 4.1 to 6.0 (39), but seldom where pH exceeds 7.0. Beech is found at low elevations in the North and relatively high elevations in the southern Appalachians. Local soil and climatic factors probably determine whether beech grows at the higher elevations. In the Adirondacks of New York, low temperatures and wind keep beech below 980 m (3,200 ft), in contrast to the southern mountains where on the warmer slopes it grows at elevations up to 1830 m (6,000 ft). At latitudes in the middle of its range, however, beech is more abundant on the cooler and moister northern slopes than on the southern slopes (39).",Soils and Topography,American Beech,fagus,grandifolia,hardwood,15,0
"Beech mast is palatable to a large variety of birds and mammals, including mice, squirrels, chipmunks, black bear, deer, foxes, ruffed grouse, ducks, and bluejays. Beech is the only nut producer in the northern hardwood type. Beech wood is used for flooring, furniture, turned products and novelties, veneer, plywood, railroad ties, baskets, pulp, charcoal, and rough lumber. It is especially favored for fuelwood because of its high density and good burning qualities. Creosote made from beech wood is used internally and externally as a medicine for various human and animal disorders. (It is important to note that coal tar creosote, the kind used to protect wood from rots, is highly toxic to humans.)",Special Uses,American Beech,fagus,grandifolia,hardwood,16,0
"Throughout its range, American elm seldom grows in pure stands and is usually found in mixture with other species. It is a major component of four forest cover types: Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Society of American Foresters Type 39), Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62), Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93), and Sycamore-Sweetgum-American Elm (Type 94). It is a minor component in 20 other forest types. Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39) appears throughout the Northern Forest and into the Boreal Forest in Canada, and throughout the Lake States and into the northern edge of the Central Forest. In this type the most common associates, other than the type species, are as follows: In the Lake States and Canada, balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis); in Ohio and Indiana, silver maple (Acer saccharinum), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), pin oak (Quercus palustris), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides); in New England and eastern Canada, sweet birch (Betula lenta), paper birch (B. papyrifera), gray birch (B. populifolia), silver maple, and black spruce (Picea mariana); and in New York, white ash (Fraxinus americana), slippery and rock elms (Ulmus rubra and U. thomasii), yellow birch, black tupelo, sycamore, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), swamp white oak, and silver maple. Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62) is common throughout the Central Forest and extends into Canada. Major associates in this type are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), pin oak, swamp white oak, eastern cottonwood, sycamore, green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and other moist site hardwoods. Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93) is found throughout the Southern Forest within the flood plains of the major rivers. Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) replaces sugarberry (C.laevigata) in the northern part of the range. Major associates are water hickory (Carya aquatica), Nuttall (Quercus nuttallii), willow (Q. phellos), water (Q. nigra), and overcup (Q. lyrata) oak, sweetgum, and boxelder (Acer negundo). Sycamore-Sweetgurn-American Elm (Type 94) appears as scattered stands throughout the Southern Forest region and lower Ohio River Valley. Common associates include green ash, sugarberry, hackberry, boxelder, silver maple, cottonwood, black willow (Salix nigra), water oak, and pecan (Carya illinoensis).",Associated Forest Cover,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,1,0
"Within the natural range of American elm, the climate varies from warm and humid in the southeast to cold and dry in the northwest. Average temperatures are as follows: January, from -18° C (0° F) and below in Canada and 16° C (60° F) in central Florida; July, from 16° C (60° F) in Manitoba to 27° C (80° F) in the Southern States; annual maximum, 32° C (90° F) to 35° C (95° F) in the Northeast and 38° C (100° F) to 41° C (105° F) in the South and West; annual minimum, from -40° C (-40° F) to -18° C (0° F) in the North and -18° C (0° F) to -1° C (30° F) in the South. Average annual precipitation varies from a scarce 380 min (15 in) in the Northwest to a plentiful 1520 mm (60 in) on the gulf coast. Over the central part of the species range there are about 760 to 1270 min (30 to 50 in) per year. Throughout the range most of the precipitation comes during the warm (April-September) season. Average annual snowfall generally varies from none in Florida to about 200 cm (80 in) in the Northeast. A few areas, mainly around the Great Lakes, get 254 to 380 cm (100 to 150 in) of snow per year.

"The study of genetics in American elm has been primarily directed toward combining resistance to Dutch elm disease with desirable growth Characteristics. Only a few selections from American elm look promising at this time. Noteworthy is the ""American Liberty"" elm, a multiclonal variety selected from second-generation crosses of the most resistant parents. Despite high selection intensity, their resistance is still inferior to resistant cultivars derived from Asian or European sources. A few horticultural forms have been recognized. These are Ulmus americana columnaris, a form with a narrow columnar head, U. americana ascendens, with upright branches, and U. americana pendula, with long pendulous branches. Hybridization within the genus Ulmus has been aimed primarily at breeding for Dutch elm disease and phloem necrosis resistance. Because of the difficulty of hybridizing American elm, which has a chromosome number twice that of all the other elms (56 versus 28), most of the breeding and selection work does not include American elm. Thousands of attempts to cross the American with the Siberian elm have failed. Reports of successful artificial hybridization and verification of hybridizing American elm with other elms are rare.",Genetics,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,7,0

The native range of American elm.",Native Range,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The process of flowering, seed ripening and seed fall in American elm takes place in the spring throughout the range. The glabrous flower buds swell early in February in the South and as late as May in Canada. The flowers appear 2 to 3 weeks before leaf flush. Soon after wind pollination occurs, the fruit ripens, and seed fall is usually complete by mid-March in the South and mid-June in the North. American elm flowers are typically perfect and occur on long, slender, drooping pedicels, about 2.5 cm (1 in) long, in 3- or 4-flowered short-stalked fascicles. The anthers are bright red, the ovary and styles are light green, and the calyx is green tinged with red above the middle. With controlled pollinations, floral receptivity is greatest when stigma lobes are reflexed above the anthers. The trees are essentially self-sterile. A test in Canada showed only 1.5 percent viable seed from self-pollinated flowers. Pollination may be hampered in a wet spring since the flower anthers will not open in a saturated atmosphere (9). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production in American elm may begin as early as age 15 but is seldom abundant before age 40. When mature, American elm is a prolific seed producers Trees as old as 300 years have been reported to bear seeds. In closed stands, seed production is greatest in the exposed tops of dominant trees. The winged seeds are light and readily disseminated by the wind. Although most seeds fall within 91 in (300 ft) of the parent tree, some may be carried 0.4 kin (0.25 mi) or more. In river-bottom stands, the seeds may be waterborne for miles. Cleaned but not dewinged seeds average 156,000/kg (70,900/lb). Adverse weather may reduce the seed crop. Spring frosts can injure and kill both flowers and fruit. Observations in Minnesota showed that while nearly ripe seeds were not injured by night temperatures of -3° C (27° F) for several successive nights, most were killed a week later when the temperature dropped to -7° C (19° F) and remained below freezing for 60 hours. Mammals and birds also may reduce the seed crop. The flower buds, flowers, and fruit are eaten by gray squirrels. The seeds are also eaten by mice, squirrels, opossum, ruffed grouse, Northern bobwhite, and Hungarian partridge. Seedling Development- Germination in American elm seed is epigeal. It usually germinates soon after it falls, although some seeds may remain dormant until the following spring. While germination may extend over a period of 60 days, most of the seeds germinate in 6 to 12 days. Germination is best with night temperatures at 20° C (68° F) and day temperatures of 30° C (86° F). However, germination is almost as good when daily temperatures range between 10° C (50° F) and 21° C (70° F). Seeds can germinate in darkness, but germination increases in light. Seeds also can lie on flooded ground for as long as 1 month with little adverse effect on germination, except possibly where siltation occurs in flooded bottoms. American elm seedlings can become established on moist litter, moss, and decayed logs and stumps, but do best on mineral soil. Although they do grow in full sunlight, seedlings perform best with about one-third of full sunlight during the first year. After the first year or two, they grow best in full sunlight. Seedlings that develop in saturated soils are stunted and characterized by early yellowing and loss of the cotyledons, extremely short internodes, and small leaves. American elm can withstand flooding in the dormant season but dies if the flooding is prolonged into the growing season. Compared with other bottomland species, American elm is intermediately tolerant to complete inundation. Some may be killed by early fall frosts, but those that survive soon are hardened by temperatures alternating between 0° C (32° F) and 10° C (50° F). A constant temperature of 0° C (32° F) for 5 days also hardens the seedlings enough to avoid frost killing (7). Studies in Iowa and southeastern Michigan on wet lowland and upland mesic sites show that despite high mortality from Dutch elm disease, the next generation will be much like the last. Although American elm has been essentially eliminated from the overstory, it is a significant part of the understory and seedling layers. Some observations suggest that there will be a shift toward more intolerant species under the dead elms. American elm may be perpetuated for generations, even though the average life span of the trees is likely to be reduced. Where seeds are available, American elm is a prominent early invader of abandoned fields. On upland sites in the Midwest, fire, as a natural component of the environment, has kept American elm from invading the prairies (1,2,12,13). In determining vegetational patterns and succession, allelopathy is apparently not as important for species coming in under American elm as it is for species coming in under sycamore, hackberry, northern red oak, and white oak. In a test in Missouri, there was lower productivity and higher percent soil moisture under all test species but American elm. This apparently was due to toxic leaf leachate present from the four test species, but not present in leachate from American elm (11). Vegetative Reproduction- Small American elm trees produce vigorous stump sprouts. Although not documented, some observations suggest that replacement in dense, undisturbed bottom-land stands in Minnesota may be by root suckers of mature trees. American elm can be propagated by softwood cuttings taken in June and treated with indolebutyric acid or by leaf bud cuttings. In a test, greenhouse-grown stock rooted easier than field-grown stock. Propagation by dormant root cuttings has not been effective.",Reproduction and Early Growth,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- American elm seldom grows in pure stands and there is no information on stand yields. On good sites in dense forest stands American elm may reach 30 to 38 m (98 to 125 ft) in height and 122 to 152 cm (48 to 60 in) in d.b.h., with a 15 m (49 ft) clear bole. On medium sites, heights of 24 m (80 ft) are common. On very wet soils or on the very dry soils of the Plains, however, the species is often only 12 to 18 m (40 to 60 ft) tall at maturity. In open-grown or sparse stands, the trees usually fork near the ground and form wide arching crowns. American elm is a long-lived species, often reaching 175 to 200 years, with some older than 300 years. Rooting Habit- The depth of rooting varies with soil texture and soil moisture. In heavy, wet soils the root system is widespread and within 0.9 to 1.2 m (3 to 4 ft) of the surface. On drier medium-textured soils, the roots usually penetrate 1.5 to 3.0 m (5 to 10 ft). In deep, relatively dry sands in the Dakotas, American elm may develop a taproot reaching 5.5 to 6.1 m (18 to 20 ft) down to the water table. Reaction to Competition- American elm is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance among the eastern hardwoods. Usually it responds well to release, often growing more rapidly than its associates at advanced ages. Once it becomes dominant in a mixed hardwood stand, it is seldom overtaken by other species. It can persist in the understory of pioneer species such as eastern cottonwood, black willow, and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) but dies if suppressed by tolerant sugar maple or American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Damaging Agents- Since 1930, when Dutch elm disease reached the United States in a shipment of elm logs from Europe, it has spread to 41 States from coast to coast. The causal fungus, Ceratocystis ulmi, is introduced into the sap stream of twigs or small branches during feeding by the smaller European elm bark beetle, Scolytus multistriatus, and the native elm bark beetle, Hylurgopinus rufipes. Dutch elm disease is characterized by a gradual wilting and yellowing of the foliage, usually followed by death of the branches and eventually the whole tree (5,14). In addition to Dutch elm disease, several other diseases also are responsible for losses in shade and forest elms. Phloem necrosis, caused by a virus (Morsus ulmi) is detected by flagging or browned leaves and butterscotch-colored phloem with a wintergreen odor. It is transmitted by the whitebanded elm leafhopper (Scaphoideus luteolus) and through root grafts. Trees usually die within a year after symptoms appear. Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum) is soil borne and usually enters host plants through the roots. Trees show dieback symptoms similar to Dutch elm disease (10). Other diseases include diebacks caused by Cephalosporium spp. and Dothiorella ulmi; a leaf black spot (Gnomonia ulmea); twig blight (Cytosporina ludibunda); cankers (Nectria spp., Sphaeropsis ulmicola, and Phytophthora inflata); elm wetwood (Erwinia nimipressuralis); and elm mosaic virus (3,4). Some of the common wood rot fungi are Pleurotus ulmarius, P. ostreatus, Armillaria mellea, Ganoderma applanatum, Phellinus igniarius, and numerous species of Polyporus. American elm is attacked by hundreds of insect species including defoliators, bark beetles, borers, leaf rollers, leaf miners, twig girdlers, and sucking insects. The carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robinae) bores into the sapwood and degrades the wood. Among the insects that defoliate elm are the spring cankerworm (Paleacrita vernata), the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the elm leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta luteola), the whitemarked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), the elm spanworm (Ennomos subsignaria), and many other leaf-eating insects that attack elm and other hardwoods. The elm cockscombgall aphid (Colopha ulmicola) forms galls on the leaves but does little damage to the tree. Several scale insects attack elm and may cause damage. Both the elm scurfy scale (Chionaspis americana) and the European elm scale (Gossyparia spuria) are widely distributed. Among the leafhoppers, the whitebanded elm leafhopper is classed as a serious pest since it is the vector for phloem necrosis (15). Besides insect and disease losses, animal damage, and fire, climatic factors also can have an impact on survival and growth of American elm. Young forest trees may sunscald when exposed by harvesting or thinning operations. Open-grown American elm forks and develops a widespread crown that is susceptible to injury by heavy, wet snows and glaze storms. Of 37 tree species examined after an ice storm in Illinois, American elm ranked fourth in susceptibility to ice damage. In dense stands, such injuries are less severe and are not generally a management problem. Although American elm is shallow rooted in wet soils, it is fairly windfirm because the roots are widespread. The species is reasonably drought resistant, but prolonged drought reduces growth and may cause death. During the drought of 1934, in the Midwest prairie region, losses of American elm and associated species ran as high as 80 to 90 percent. The 1951-54 drought also caused severe losses in the bottom lands of the South where American elm was more susceptible to drought than the lowland red oaks. Prolonged spring floods may cause death or growth loss. Despite suitable temperatures, in Minnesota bottom lands root elongation does not begin until the spring floods recede and soil aeration increases. On these sites and where trees are planted between street and sidewalk, buttress roots often are a result of inadequate soil aeration. Fire damage is not a major management problem in the North; however, in southern bottom lands, fall and sometimes early spring fires are extremely damaging. Fires can kill seedling- and sapling-size trees and wound larger trees, thus admitting heartrot fungi. Animal damage to American elm, from the sapling stage to maturity, is not a serious problem except for sapsucker injury that degrades the wood.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,14,0
"American elm is most common on flats and bottom lands throughout its range but is not restricted to these sites. On the southern bottom-land region, it is found widely in first bottoms and terraces, especially on first bottom flats, but not in deep swamps. At higher elevations in the Appalachians, it is often limited to the vicinity of large streams and rarely appears at elevations above 610 in (2,000 ft). In West Virginia, however, it does appear in high coves at elevations of 760 in (2,500 ft). In the Lake and Central States, it is found on plains and morainal hills as well as on bottom lands and swamp margins. Along the northwestern edge of the range, it is usually restricted to valley bottoms along watercourses. Although American elm is common on bottom-land soils, it is found on many of the great soil groups within its range. The soils include well-drained sands, organic bogs, undifferentiated silts, poorly drained clays, prairie loams, and many intermediate combinations. American elm grows best on rich, well-drained loams. Soil moisture greatly influences its growth. Growth is poor in droughty sands and in soils where the summer water table is high. In Michigan, on loam and clay soils, growth is good when the summer water table drops 2.4 to 3.0 in (8 to 10 ft) below the surface, medium with summer water table at 1.2 to 2.4 in (4 to 8 ft), and poor when topsoil is wet throughout the year. On sandy soils underlain with clay, growth is medium to good where the summer water table is 0.6 m (2 ft) or more below the soil surface. Organic soils are usually poor sites, but those with a summer water table at least 0.6 m (2 ft) below the surface are classed as medium sites for American elm. In the South, American elm is common on clay and silty-clay loams on first bottoms and terraces; growth is medium on wetter sites and good on well-drained flats in first bottoms (8). In the and western end of the range, it is usually confined to the silt or clay loams in river bottoms and terraces. In shelterbelt plantings on the uplands, however, survival is generally best on sandy soils where the moisture is more evenly distributed to greater depths than in fine-textured soils. American elm most commonly grows on soils of the orders Alfisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Ultisols. Soil acidity under stands of American elm varies from acid on some of the swamp margin sites in the Lake States to mildly alkaline on the prairie soils. A soil reaction considered suitable for this species ranges from pH 5.5 to 8.0. Leaf litter of American elm decomposes more rapidly than that of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), white oak (Quercus alba), and northern red oak (Q. rubra). Under Missouri conditions, the leaves crumble readily after 18 months on the ground. They have a relatively high content of potassium and also of calcium (1 to 2 percent). Because its litter decomposes rapidly and contains many desirable nutrients, American elm is considered a ""soil-improving"" species.",Soils and Topography,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,15,0
"Before the advent of Dutch elm disease, American elm was prized for its use as a street tree. It was fast growing, hardy, tolerant to stress, and appreciated for its characteristic vaselike crown. Beautiful shaded streets in many cities attested to its popularity. The wood of American elm is moderately heavy, hard, and stiff. It has interlocked grain and is difficult to split, which is an advantage for its use as hockey sticks and where bending is needed. It is used principally for furniture, hardwood dimension, flooring, construction and mining timbers, and sheet metal work. Some elm wood goes into veneer for making boxes, crates, and baskets, and a small quantity is used for pulp and paper manufacture.",Special Uses,American Elm,ulmus,americana,hardwood,16,0
"In longleaf pine-slash pine (Pinus palustris-P. elliottii) forests of the coastal plain, frequent prescribed fires are more limiting to the presence of American holly than site. Within that timber type, therefore, association is mainly with trees of bottom lands, swamps, or other sites not subject to burning. In the loblolly pine-shortleaf pine and upland hardwood types where fire is not so common, holly, as well as numerous other hardwoods, is found beneath the pines on a wide range of sites. Because of its slow growth and relatively short stature, holly is seldom dominant. It is an understory component of a number of forest cover types (10). Common associates of holly in various parts of its geographic range are shown in table 1.",Associated Forest Cover,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,1,0
"Like the southern pines, American holly is primarily a plant of the humid Southeast. Annual precipitation throughout its range is 1020 to 1650 mm (40 to 65 in) with over 2030 mm (80 in) in the southern Appalachians. Growing season varies from about 150 days in the Appalachian Mountains, the northeastern limit of the range, to almost yearlong in the central Florida peninsula. Average minimum temperature in the coastal plain portion of its range is above -18° C (0° F) but in the mountains of West Virginia, holly grows where the average low temperature is below -23° C (-10° F) (20). Holly cultivars in a northern Ohio arboretum, north of its natural range, have survived -29° C (-20° F) (12). American holly is the hardiest known broadleaf evergreen tree (23).",Climate,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,2,0
"Topel holly (I. x attenuata Ashe) is a hybrid of I. opaca and dahoon holly (I. cassine), with long spiny-pointed leaves, that grows in South Carolina and northwestern Florida (21,34). Several cultivars registered under flex opaca, such as Foster, Hume, Savannah, and East Palatka, are actually I. x attenuata (9). Crosses have occurred between American holly and myrtle dahoon (I. myrtifolia), which, like dahoon holly, is an evergreen, red-fruited shrub or small tree found on wet sites of the coastal plain (24).",Hybrids,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,9,0
"From the maritime forests of Massachusetts, holly is scattered along the coast to Delaware. It grows inland into several Pennsylvania counties and abundantly southward throughout the coastal plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian system. The range extends south to mid-peninsular Florida, west to eastern Texas and southeastern Missouri (20). It corresponds roughly to the combined ranges for loblolly and shortleaf pines. -The native range of American holly.",Native Range,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,11,0
"American holly has 36 chromosomes, differing from the basic number for the genus Rex of 9 or 10 (24). Although leaf spininess and fruit colors vary, the coastal-dune hollies are usually smaller than those on the rich bottom lands of the Mississippi River Delta. Only one botanical variety other than the typical variety is recognized (21). Dune holly (Ilex opaca var. arenicola) grows on deep sandy soils in north and central Florida. It has lanceolate or oblanceolate leaves with forward-pointing teeth and oval, shallowly grooved nutlets. Yellow-fruited holly, once named a variety, is now considered only the expression of the recessive yellow color gene present in nearly all red-fruited hollies. Spineless leaves were once the basis for segregating another variety but the trait is highly variable; spiny and spineless leaves often grow on the same plant (34). More than 1,000 cultivars of American holly have been named, although not all have been registered with the International Registration Authority. These do not necessarily represent different forms of Ilex opaca; many were selected because of unusual growth habit, fruit color, size or shape, or degree of leaf spininess (9).",Population Differences,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Hollies are dioecious; male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers, similar in appearance, with four to six small white petals, are produced on separate plants on the current season's growth. The male-to-female ratio for 1,930 seedlings from 10 randomly chosen, open-pollinated pistillate trees was 1.03 to 1.00 after 9 years had elapsed and all seedlings had produced flowers. Flowering began as early as age 3 and the latest bloomed at age 9, staminate plants flowering somewhat earlier on the average than pistillate. For this reason, the male-to-female ratio at age 5 was about 5 to 1 (5). Flowering begins in April in the southern part of the range of American holly, and in June at the northern limits. Pollination is accomplished by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, yellowjackets, and night-flying moths (3). Staminate trees should be planted close to fruit-producing trees (34). Although some female hollies are apparently isolated by distance from pollen-bearing trees, good fruit crops are produced regularly. The fruit, commonly called ""berries,"" are technically four-seeded drupes or pyrenes. They ripen from September through December and remain on the tree through most of the winter unless consumed by birds or other wildlife. The fruit is round to ellipsoid, about 6 to 12 mm. (0.25 to 0.50 in) in diameter, and bright-but not shiny-red, orange, or occasionally yellow in color. The four seeds in each fruit are bony with a coarsely reticulated, ridged surface (34). Seed germination is very slow, requiring from 16 months to 3 years in nature. Germination tests over a 2.5-year period indicated only 33 to 56 percent germination capacity. Overwinter storage or cold, moist stratification improves germination. Sowing immediately after collection has been recommended although complete germination does not occur until the second or third spring (4). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production may be low in years of heavy spring rain, as rain can diminish the wide dissemination of pollen. A late frost can kill the spring flowers, eliminating a fruit crop. Frequent prescribed burning also drastically reduces fruit production. Such crop failures are rare and localized, however, and an abundance of seed can be found each year (19,24). Clean seeds average approximately 61,730/kg (28,000/lb) and about four units (by weight) of fruit yield one unit of clean seeds (4). Seeds are dispersed mainly by birds and small mammals. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Following germination, holly seedlings rapidly develop a taproot and numerous lateral roots. American holly is very shade tolerant and may become established from bird droppings in the understory of upland pine plantations or bottom land hardwoods. It is very susceptible to fire and may be completely lacking in regularly or even occasionally burned forests (35). Initial growth is slow, averaging about 1.8 in (6 ft) in 16 years under medium shade (32). The bark is easily injured by fire and even large trees may be killed by light fires in the understory. Fastest growth of American holly was probably achieved in a North Carolina holly plantation; after 9 years of cultural practices such as mowing, mulching, and fertilizing, 10-year-old hollies averaged about 6.7 in (22 ft) in height and 3.7 in (12 ft) in crown spread and produced abundant fruit (24). Vegetative Reproduction- Young holly trees usually sprout if the tops are removed by cutting or burning. Because of a taproot and a profilic lateral root system, young hollies can be transplanted without much difficulty (6). Transplanting should be done during the dormant season, usually November through March. Small plants may be dug bare-rooted if roots are kept moist, but larger plants should be balled and burlapped (34). When wild hollies are transplanted from the woods, tops should be severely pruned and most of the remaining leaves removed (16). Small trees should be allowed to flower before transplanting to ensure the selection of fruit-bearing individuals. Root pruning to a depth of 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft), a year before lifting, improves transplanting success (27). In Ohio, outside the natural range of American holly, better outplanting success has been obtained with plants 60 to 120 em (24 to 48 in) tall than those 30 cm (12 in) or less, because of winterkill of the younger plants (11). Holly can be produced from cuttings taken in August or September and December. Cuttings should be taken from the current season's ripened wood, with a small section of 2-year-old wood including several leaves. Cuttings should be set slanting in about 15 cm (6 in) of peatmoss and soil moisture, with the leaves lying flat on the surface. Treating with indolebutyric acid (IBA) and growing under high humidity with bottom heat is also recommended (6,24). ""Quick dips"" in IBA at high concentrations (up to 20,000 p/m) are recommended for cultivars that are normally hard to propagate (27). Root cuttings are unsatisfactory.",Reproduction and Early Growth,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Because of its intolerance of fire, holly is found as scattered trees, even on good holly sites. Its slow growth and limby habit detract from its timber value. American holly under intensive culture is capable of 0.9 to 1.2 m (3 to 4 ft) of height growth per year (3). Holly dominates some of the maritime forests of the Atlantic coast near the northern limit of its range, associated with salt-intolerant species such as black cherry (Prunus serotina), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis). One of the best developed coastal stands reported was at Sandy Hook in New Jersey, where 97 percent of the tree basal area of a 30-ha (74-acre) forest was American holly. The oldest holly was 144 years old and 62 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. Height of holly trees in these sandy coastal forests ranges from 4.6 to 9.1 m (15 to 30 ft). Older trees or those on better sites may reach 15.2 m (50 ft) (28). The ""national champion"" American holly, in the Congaree Swamp of South Carolina, is 30.2 m (99 ft) tall, with a circumference of 248 cm (98 in), a trunk diameter of 79 cm (31 in), and a crown diameter of 12.2 m (40 ft) (2). Hollies 30 to 90 cm (24 to 36 in) in diameter measured near the ground are common in the Mississippi River Delta (24). Trees 30.5 m (100 ft) tall and 122.0 cm (48 in) in d.b.h. have been recorded (18), but such trees were over 100 years old. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Holly is classed as very shade tolerant and can survive in the understory of most forest canopies, but growth may be slowed and flowering and fruit set reduced under shade (22). Leaf area increased and leaves were greener under shade (30). In a mesic pine-hardwood forest of east Texas, dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), white oak (Quercus alba), and water oak (Q. nigra), holly was the principal understory species (15). Its slow growth allows faster growing species of the same age to overtop it. Shade and root competition in natural stands reduced average height of hollies at age 16 by about 0.3 m (1 ft) in medium shade and 0.61 m (2 ft) in heavy shade, compared with those growing in full sunlight. Crown area was reduced by one-third under medium shade and by more than one-half under heavy shade (32). Damaging Agents- The greatest damage to holly trees is indiscriminate harvesting of foliage with berries for Christmas decorating. Before laws were passed in Maryland and Delaware to protect the holly, there was a ""roadside"" market for holly vandalized from trees that did not belong to harvesters. Trees were left mutilated and many died (17). Fire is another deadly enemy of American holly. Most commercial pine timberland is burned often enough to eliminate holly seedlings or sprouts, especially where livestock graze. Burning where hollies are in the midstory can seriously damage the bark and kill trees. Three annual fires in a southern pine forest reduced the number of fruit-producing holly trees by 95 percent (19). The thick evergreen leaves, which remain on the trees until the spring of their third year (18), are year-long hosts to many foliage diseases and insects. Few threaten the health of the trees, but many may reduce the esthetic and commercial value of the foliage. Diseases include 14 species of leaf spot fungi, six species of black mildews, two powdery mildews, and one rust. The most common and widespread of the leafspots are caused by the fungi Cercospora pulvinula, Phacidium curtissii, Phyllosticta opaca, and Physalospora ilicis. The rust Chrysomyxa ilicina is known only from the southern Appalachian area. Hollies of the northeast are subject to a serious leaf and twig blight caused by Corynebacterium ilicis (16). Although nearly 30 species of insects are known to attack holly, only a few are serious pests. The southern red mite (Oligonychus ilicis) causes a reduction in leaf and twig growth and undesirable foliage color. The native holly leafminer (Phytomyza ilicicola) can damage foliage severely, causing leaves to drop prematurely. The holly midge (Asphondylia ilicicola) feeds on the berries causing them to remain green in color. Several species of scale insects feed on holly, including the holly scale (Asterolecanium puteanum) (1,24). Strong winds cause spines of mature leaves to puncture other leaves, rendering the foliage less valuable for decoration (24). In northern portions of its range, twigs and branches can be killed during extreme cold periods (12), although holly is quite hardy (23). Holly is more resistant to damage from salt spray than associated woody species in the maritime forests of New England, enabling it to dominate coastal stands (29). Hollies are intolerant of flooding and may die if their roots are inundated for a period of several weeks (31).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,14,0
"Holly survives on a wide variety of soils from near sterile Inceptisols of Atlantic sandy beaches to fertile but thin mountain Ultisols to an elevation of approximately 915 m (3,000 ft) (8). Largest trees are found in the rich bottom lands and swamps of the coastal plain. Growth is best on moist, slightly acid, well-drained sites such as upland pine sites and hammocks. Trees will not survive flooding or saturated soils for more than 17 percent of the growing season (31). In the northeastern portion of its range, holly is found on sandy coastal soils or dry gravelly soils farther inland (16).",Soils and Topography,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,15,0
"The attractiveness of its foliage is American holly's principal value, whether as a forest tree, planted ornamental, or Christmas decoration. The development of commercial holly orchards and the education of landowners in the value and harvesting of holly foliage have lessened the exploitation of wild hollies (13). The wood of American holly is tough and hard but not strong. It is close-grained and moderately heavy, weighing about 640.7 kg/m³ (40 lb/ft³). Specific gravity is 0.61 (oven-dry) and about 0.50 green. It is one of the whitest woods known, with white sapwood and ivory-white heartwood. Growth rings are almost indistinct. The wood is used for veneer and to a limited extent as pulpwood and lumber. Greatest use of the wood is for specialty items such as fancy cabinet inlays, small pieces of furniture, brush backs, handles, novelties, wood engravings, scroll work, woodcuts and carvings, and measuring scales and rules for scientific instruments; when dyed black to resemble ebony, it is used for piano keys, violin pegs, and fingerboards (6,18,33). Birds are the principal consumers of the fruit, although deer, squirrels, and other small mammals also eat them. Cattle sometimes browse the foliage. At least 18 species of birds including songbirds, mourning doves, wild turkeys, and the bobwhite are known to eat the fruit (14,34). Perhaps the most important in seed dispersal, however, are the large winter-migrating flocks of small birds such as the cedar waxwing and American goldfinch. The complete stripping of all berries from a 10.7 m (35 ft) tall holly in a few seconds by a flock of cedar waxwings has been observed. Despite the presence of saponins in the leaves and berries, American holly is not considered poisonous to man or animals (36). Although not as well known as gallberry (Ilex glabra) as a honey plant, its nectar makes excellent honey (24).",Special Uses,American Holly,ilex,opaca,hardwood,16,0
"An American hornbeam, variety virginiana, is recognized by some authorities but its validity is questionable. It replaces the typical form in the northern half of the species range with some overlapping in the Central States. The two forms are separated by features of the bract of the fruiting ament and the leaves, but in Ohio the two characteristics do not necessarily vary at the same time, resulting in confusion (8). American hornbeam exhibits clines (from north to south) in several physiological and morphological properties. Fruit weights increase northward (62); the length of cold preconditioning required for bud bursting varies latitudinally (56), and the specific gravity of the wood is higher for trees growing north of latitude 36°N. than for trees growing at latitudes 31° to 36° N. (55). The species has eight pairs of chromosomes (63).",Genetics,American Hornbeam,carpinus,caroliniana,hardwood,7,0
"American hornbeam is native to most of the eastern United States and extends into Canada in southwest Quebec and southeast Ontario. Its western limit is just beyond the Mississippi River from north-central Minnesota to the Missouri River, where it ranges southwestward into much of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains and eastern Texas. It grows throughout much of the South but is absent from the Mississippi River bottom land south of Missouri, the lowermost Gulf Coastal Plain, and the southern two-thirds of Florida. Northward along the east coast, it is not found in the New Jersey pine barrens, much of Long Island, Cape Cod, northern and eastern Maine, and the White and Adirondack Mountains. It is found in central and southern Mexico, Guatemala, and western Honduras. -The native range of American hornbeam. The climate varies greatly from north to south in this species habitat. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 mm. (28 in) in Minnesota to 1570 mm (62 in) along the Gulf Coast. Most precipitation occurs during the growing season, April through September. Mean January temperatures range from -13° C (8° F) to 16° C (60° F) and the mean July temperatures range from 16° C (60° F) to 29° C (84° F). Frost-free periods are from 80 to 320 days. Best growth and development of American hornbeam occurs on rich, wet-mesic sites, but it is not restricted to such sites and can tolerate a wide variety of conditions. Habitat requirements and tolerances of the species are similar across its range. Soils primarily associated with the species are in the orders Alfisols, Ultisols, and Inceptisols but American hornbeam also occurs on Entisols, Spodosols, Histosols, and Mollisols. The best sites may be characterized as having abundant soil moisture but sufficient drainage to prevent saturation and poor aeration of the soil during the growing season (4,51). Typically, the best sites are alluvial or colluvial soils in the transition zone between mesic and wet areas (46), as near lakes and swamps (35), on well-drained terraces of rivers (32,45), terraces or steep slopes of minor streams with some gradient (39), coves, ravine bottoms (33), and rises in lowlands (40). Surface soil layers are somewhat poorly to well drained but the subsoil may not be as well drained, may have a high fluctuating water table, or may be of heavier texture. Soil water-holding capacity usually is high (15,49). Upper soil horizons are primarily loams or of loam-influenced textures. Nutrients and organic matter tend to accumulate on these sites (36), and calcium and magnesium in particular are normally more abundant than in surrounding soils (13). Soil pH tends to be acidic-normally from 4.0 to 5.6-but can be as high as 7.4 (35). The species also grows well on wetter sites, such as hardwood swamps on mineral soils or mucks (3,37). The key appears to be improving soil moisture conditions through the growing season because the species is only moderately tolerant of flooding (14). It is eliminated from sites inundated more than 25 percent of the time (24). Accordingly, it is absent or rare on the wettest sites, such as lower floodplain terraces, permanently inundated areas, and swamps with peat soils. American hornbeam also grows, to a lesser extent, on mesic to xeric sites (5,19). In Florida and Ontario the species occurs more often on dry-mesic than on mesic or xeric sites. The dry-mesic sites in Ontario have a higher soil moisture retaining capacity than the others (35). In hilly terrain it is found most frequently on north aspects but also grows on ridge tops and on south aspects where subirrigation of the site improves soil moisture (51). The upper altitudinal limit of American hornbeam is 910 m (3,000 ft) in the Great Smoky Mountains ' but it is much more common at about 490 in (1,600 ft) (59). Concentrations of potassium, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus in the foliage of the species are low in comparison to those of other species (2). American hornbeam leaf litter, on the other hand, has high concentrations of these nutrients in relation to other species (57). American hornbeam is typically an understory species and only rarely occurs in the overstory or dominates a stand. It is present in the following forest cover types (Society of American Foresters) (22): Northern Forest Region, Black Cherry-Maple (Type 28), Beech-Sugar Maple (Type 60); Central Forest Region, White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), White Oak (Type 53), Northern Red Oak (Type 55), River Birch-Sycamore (Type 61), Pin Oak-Sweetgum (Type 65); Southern Forest Region, Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91), Sweetgum-Yellow-Poplar (Type 87). American hombeam is found in a wide variety of forest communities and with many tree species because its habitat frequently is an ecotone in which species from wet and mesic sites intergrade. In the North, it is a minor component of many different types, infrequently becoming the first or second most abundant tree species in the subcanopy layer (32). It is associated with northern hardwoods and their wet site variants. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and/or American beech (Fagus grandifolia) are dominant in many situations but may be replaced by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), red maple (Acer rubrum), American elm (Ulmus americana), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and black ash (Fraxinus nigra) on wetter sites. In the central portion of its range, American hornbeam also is a minor component of stands. Species dominant in northern stands also dominate here along with white (Quercus alba), black (Q. Velutina), northern red (Q. rubra), scarlet (Q. coccinea), pin (Q. palustris), and chinkapin (Q. muehlenbergii) oak; bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis); black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica); sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua); yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera); river birch (Betula nigra); and basswood (Tilia americana). The species attains its greatest prominence in southern stands, yet remains a member of the understory. In a number of areas it is the most numerous of all tree species in the stand (36,40). It is found in southern mixed hardwood and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests. Overstory species that frequently dominate these stands are sweetgum, water Quercus nigra), white, laurel (Q. laurifolia), willow (Q. phellos), cherrybark (Q. falcata var. pagodifolia), and swamp chestnut (Q. prinus) oak, American beech, black tupelo, red maple, loblolly pine, southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), and yellow-poplar. The species is also an important member of some nonforest vegetative types in the Northeast. It is an early migrant and forms pure stands in moist old fields (61) and grows in persistent shrub communities in old pastures on hilltops and more exposed hilltops (20). Understory tree species associated with American hornbeam throughout much of its range include eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), the serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), and speckled alder (Alnus rugosa). Northern associates are striped (Acer pensylvanicum) and mountain maple (A. spicatum). Red mulberry (Morus rubra), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis) are common associates from the Central States southward. In the South, associated species include sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), possumhaw (Ilex decidua), American holly (Ilex opaca), winged elm (Ulmus alata), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), water-elm (Planera aquatica), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), riverflat hawthorn (C. opaca), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and Carolina laurelcherry (Prunus caroliniana). Shrub species associated with American hornbeam throughout its range include spicebush (Lindera benzoin) and southern arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum). In the northern half of its range, American hombeam is associated with mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium), redberry elder (Sambucus pubens), common winterberry (Ilex verticillata), and alternateleaf dogwood (Cornus alternifolia). In the southern half of its range it is associated with devils-walkingstick (Aralia spinosa), beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), Virginia-willow (Itea virginica), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), sweetleaf (Symplocos tinctoria), and tree sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum).",Habitat,American Hornbeam,carpinus,caroliniana,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The species is monoecious, with male and female catkins borne separately on the same tree and first appearing in the spring concurrently with leaf-out. Catkins are green to brown with red on the scales. Staminate catkins are pendant from lateral, short branches and 3 to 4 cm (1.25 to 1.5 in) long. Pollen matures and is wind disseminated in the spring (63). Pistillate catkins are 13 to 19 mm. (0.5 to 0.75 1) long and occur in spikelike groups at the terminus of leafy shoots. Flowering occurs between March 20 and May 6 in the Southeast and during April through May in the North. Seed Production and Dissemination- The fruit is an ovoid, ribbed, 5 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long nutlet. It matures in one season, changing from green to light-greenish-brown or brown on maturity. The nutlet is borne at the base of a distinctive three-lobed involucre, about 2.5 cm (I in) long; these occur in clusters 5 to 10 cm. (2 to 4 in) long. The averages reported for nutlets per kilogram range from 66,000 to 88,000 (30,000 to 40,000/lb), while the range is between 33,000 and 143,000 (15,000 and 65,000/lb) (48,62). Large seed crops occur at 3- to 5-year intervals. Seeds are primarily dispersed by birds but are also dispersed short distances by wind. Germination is epigeal. Germination capacity of stratified seed is low-usually less than 60 percent and occasionally as low as 1 to 5 percent-but 100 percent germination was obtained using immature green seed (54). Dormancy occurs in both the embryo and endosperm (48). Stratification at 4° C (40° F) for 18 weeks, stratification plus gibberellic acid treatment, and scarification of the seed coat plus gibberellic acid treatment all improve germination (9). Seedling Development- The types of seedbeds and environments favorable to establishment under natural conditions has to be surmised from nursery experience and the habitat preference of established plants. The optimum nursery seedbed has soils that are rich, loamy, and continuously moist and the site is free of extreme environmental change (48). This approximates natural conditions where the species is most frequently found. Abundant natural reproduction in undisturbed forests indicates the species ability to become established on leaf litter seedbeds under deep shade and with competition from other species (12,50). The species also becomes established on sites that are wetter and drier than optimum, as well as on open sites. American hornbeam responds well to various degrees of overstory removal in regeneration harvests. In two hardwood seed-tree harvest areas in southeastern Arkansas, the proportion of American hornbeam in the reproduction increased during the 18 years after cutting (30). Regeneration of the species consisted of advance reproduction, new seedlings, stump sprouts, and root suckers. Sprouts grew from 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) in the first year. By the 18th year, American hornbeam was becoming subordinate in diameter to sweetgum and the red oaks. The species also responded well to release after clearcutting hemlock-hardwoods in southern New England (34). However, density and basal area stocking of American hornbeam in relation to other species were unaffected after a partial harvest of a pine-hardwood stand in Louisiana (6). Vegetative Reproduction- No information available. Growth and Yield- American hornbeam is unsuited for commercial timber production because it is usually small, twisted, and multi-stemmed. In undisturbed stands, from 70 to 93 percent of the American hornbeam. were saplings less than 13 cm (5 in) d.b.h., and less than 1 percent were 25 cm (10 in) d.b.h. or larger (21,40), which is a common minimum diameter for saw logs. Heights of mature individuals generally range from 5 to 6 m (15 to 20 ft) in Canada and from 8 to 11 m (25 to 35 ft) in the South. The largest individual was found in New York. It has a diameter of 70 cm (27 in), a height of 20 m (65 ft), and a crown spread of 20 m (66 ft) (29). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- American horn beam is a very shade-tolerant species, capable of persisting in the understories of late seral and climax communities. Tolerance is greatest among seedlings and declines as the trees age, requiring an opening in the canopy for the species to reach maturity. It is one of a few species in both northern and southern forests whose abundant reproduction assures its replacement in stands across a wide spectrum of sites (27,35). This is evidenced by an inverse-J-shaped diameter distribution for the species in many stands. On certain southern sites the species is so aggressive that it will replace overstory species lost through logging or catastrophe and prevent larger species from reproducing (17,30). Ecologists consider American hombeam a member of near-climax to climax communities. In Wisconsin where climax species are assigned a climax adaptation number of 10, American hombeam is rated 7 and 8 on uplands and 8 and 9 on lowlands for the northern and southern parts of the State, respectively (16). Similarly the species is rated 7 in New Jersey (11). It is ranked fifth highest among 79 Central States species on the basis of a multivariate analysis of various species characteristics that favor establishment and growth under climax forest conditions (58). American hornbeam first appeared in seral communities developing on old fields about 12 to 18 years after the sites were abandoned in North Carolina (41) and about 25 to 40 years after the sites were sapling-sizeabandoned in New Jersey (26). It enters these communities as a minor component when a sapling-size tree-shrub community is dominant. In much older stands in North Carolina it is more abundant. In maturing second-growth hardwood stands in Connecticut, hornbeam had initially been an important species, the most abundant one, in fact, on moist sites. But, over a 50-year period it declined in density, basal area, and ingrowth, eventually becoming a minor component of all stands (53). In forests managed for commercial timber production, American hornbeam is considered a weed and is discriminated against in stand improvement. Although hornbeam is considered difficult to kill, herbicides have been effective. Mistblowing a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and injecting 2,4-D, Tordon 101, and Tordon 144 have killed 90 percent or more of the tops (43,44). Prescribed burning is used to control the understory hardwoods, including American hornbeam, that become established under southern pines. Damaging Agents- Insect and disease damage is not a serious problem with American hornbeam. The species is resistant to frost damage; its succulent foliage can withstand temperatures as low as -8.5° C (17° F) (1). The tree is very windfirm. Recreational use in forested campgrounds disposes it to increased disease infection, insect infestation and decline; it is the tree least capable of withstanding such use of the 22 hardwood species evaluated (47). American hornbeam is susceptible to fire. Wildfires severe enough to kill the hardwood component of white oak stands in Rhode Island eliminated American hornbeam (10). Normally, the species made up 6 percent of the understory stems. However, neither a crown fire nor a ground fire affected the status of American hornbeam in the ninth year after burning a loblolly pine stand in North Carolina (42).",Life History,American Hornbeam,carpinus,caroliniana,hardwood,10,0
"American hornbeam is an important food of gray squirrels in southern bottom-land hardwoods; otherwise it is of secondary importance to wildlife (25). Seeds, buds, or catkins are eaten by a number of songbirds, ruffed grouse, ring-necked pheasants, bobwhite, turkey, and fox and gray squirrels. Leaves, twigs, and larger stems are consumed by cottontails, beaver, and white-tailed deer (18,25). Reproduction is browsed by white-tailed deer throughout the species range but it is not a preferred food (7,28). The species is heavily used by beaver because it is readily available in typical beaver habitat (38). The orange and scarlet coloration in the fall make this an attractive ornamental tree. It is not widely used, however, because it is difficult to transplant and does not do well on exposed sites (60). The wood of American hornbeam is not important in commerce because the tree is too small, but its tough, dense, and close-grained wood is used for tool handles, levers, wedges, and mallets.",Special Uses,American Hornbeam,carpinus,caroliniana,hardwood,16,0
"Because Atlantic white-cedar grows characteristically in pure stands it is found mostly in one forest cover type, Atlantic White-Cedar (Society of American Foresters Type 97) (5), but is listed as an associate in six other types: Pitch Pine (Type 45); Slash Pine-Hardwood (Type 85); Baldcypress (Type 101); Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103); Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102); Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Type104). Over its great latitudinal range, however, several other species of trees have been found growing with it. These include red maple (Acer rubrum), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), gray birch (Betula populifolia), pond pine (Pinus serotina), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus). Many non-arborescent plants also grow with white-cedar. In a study of sixteen 0.04-hectare (0.1-acre) plots in southern New Jersey, the most common species of 25 shrubs associated with it were sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum), highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), dangleberry (Gaylussacia frondosa), and sweetbells leucothoe (Leucothoe racemosa). In a North Carolina study, fetterbush lyonia (Lyonia lucida) was the most common shrub, but sweetbells leucothoe, highbush blueberry, and sweet pepperbush were also present (6).",Associated Forest Cover,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,1,1
The climate throughout most of the range of white-cedar is classed as humid but varies widely in other respects. Average annual precipitation is 1020 to 1630 mm (40 to 64 in) and is well distributed throughout the year. The frost-free season is from 140 to 305 days. Temperature extremes range from -38° C (-36° F) in Maine in winter to highs of over 38° C (100° F) during the summer in most sections (6).,Climate,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,2,1
"In some taxonomic treatments of white-cedar, the southern element in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi has been named as a separate variety, Chamaecyparis thyoides var. henryae (Li) Little.

"Atlantic white-cedar grows in a narrow coastal belt 80 to 210 km (50 to 130 miles) wide from southern Maine to northern Florida and west to southern Mississippi. Atlantic white-cedar forests, however, have always been of minor importance because the scarcity of suitable sites makes distribution of the species within the coastal belt exceedingly patchy. White-cedar is most important commercially in southeastern New Jersey, southeastern Virginia, eastern North Carolina, and northwestern Florida (1,3,8,9,11). - The native range of Atlantic white-cedar.",Native Range,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- White-cedar is monoecious, but the staminate and pistillate flowers are produced on separate shoots. The flower buds are formed in the summer and, though minute, are discernible in the fall or winter. In New Jersey, the brownish staminate buds are only about 1 mm (0.04 in) long or wide in February. The greenish pistillate buds at the ends of short shoots are about the same size. When mature, the four-sided, oblong, staminate flowers are about 3 mm (0.1 in) long, and the pistillate flowers are about that wide. Pollen shedding usually occurs in early April in southern New Jersey. The cones mature at the end of the first growing season. Full-grown cones are spherical, about 6 mm (0.2 in) in diameter and contain 5 to 15 winged seeds (6). Seeds are rounded, slightly compressed, about 3 mm (0. 1 in) long, and have winged margins about as broad as the seeds. There are about 1,014,000 seeds per kilogram (460,000/lb) (12). Seed Production and Dissemination- Under favorable conditions, some 3-year-old Atlantic white-cedars bear mature cones. In one planting of 1,300 2-year-old seedlings, 2 percent of the trees had mature cones at the end of the first growing season in the field. In another planting, 20 percent of the 3-year-old seedlings produced one or more cones, and one tree had 64; but these seedlings were relatively large, 28 cm (11 in) tall. Seedlings only 10 cm (4 in) tall produced no cones (6). Natural reproduction in open stands starts bearing seed at 4 or 5 years, in dense stands at 10 to 20 years (6). Cone production varies appreciably with tree size and crown class. Intermediate or crowded stems produce markedly fewer cones than open-grown or dominant trees of the same size. In one comparison of clumped and open-grown trees, the larger, mostly dominant trees in the clumps were fully as productive as open-grown trees of the same size; but the intermediate and smaller clumped trees were much less productive than their open-grown counterparts (4). Average numbers of cones per tree for some selected sizes were as follows: White-cedar usually produces fair to excellent seed crops each year. Under one mature stand the catch in seed traps was 19.77 million seeds per hectare (8 million/acre) in 1 year and 22.24 million/ha (9 million/acre) the next year (6). Natural seed dissemination begins in October in New Jersey and most of the seeds are released before the end of the winter. In one study, 39 percent of the crop fell by November 15, more than 60 percent by December 15, and 93 by March 1 (6). Seed dispersal is influenced by weather conditions. In one series of observations, rain showers of 4 mm (0.16 in) or less caused only partial closing of some cones, whereas rains of 11 mm (0.45 in) or more caused all cones to close (6). Wind distributes most of the white-cedar seeds, although some may be further scattered by floating on water. Probably because the seeds are so small and have relatively large wings, the rate of fall is slow- 0.02 m (0.6 ft) per second in still air. Calculations based on this rate of fall indicate that a wind of 8 km/h (5 mi/h) would carry most seeds from a 15-m (50-ft) tree about 183 m (600 ft). Records of seed traps around and under white-cedar stands showed that most of the seeds fall directly under the stands. Where surrounding vegetation was of comparable height, no seeds were trapped beyond 20 in (66 ft) from the stand's edge. In a study of seed distribution from isolated trees, 60 percent of the seeds fell at a distance greater than the height of the tree, even though the catch per trap decreased greatly with increased distance. Because of prevailing winds during dry periods, 80 to 85 percent of the seed catch was on the east side of the source (6). Seedling Development- The viability of white-cedar seeds varies from very low to a high of nearly 90 percent. In some tests, the average was 84 percent (12). One cutting test of New Jersey seeds from a poor crop yielded only 8 percent sound seeds, but actual germination from a good crop the following year reached 76 percent. Viability of seeds from trees 3 to 4 years old may be low; in two tests only 3 to 25 percent of such seeds germinated (6). Germination is epigeal, but delayed germination is common. Half the seeds sown in the fall in a nursery may not germinate until the second year. Consequently, stratification for 90 days at 4° C (40° F) before sowing has been recommended (12). Some of the seeds produced by mature stands remain viable for an unknown length of time when stored in the forest floor. In a New Jersey study of sites protected from additional seedfall for 1 year, the surface 2.5 cm (1.0 in) of forest floor was found to contain 642,000 to 2,718,000 viable seeds per hectare (260,000 to 1,100,000/acre), with nearly an equal amount in the 5-cm (2-in) muck layer underneath (6). A fair amount of light is necessary for good germination of white-cedar seeds, but in one study, light intensity had to be less than 16 percent of full sunlight before germination was greatly reduced. Some germination occurred under a hardwood overstory where light intensity was only 1 percent of full sunlight (6). Favorable moisture conditions are highly important for the germination and establishment of Atlantic white-cedar seedlings. In one experiment with artificial seeding, 49 percent of the seeds germinated in clearcut plots under typical swamp conditions, whereas in similar plots on drier but still poorly drained sites, only 16 percent germinated on exposed soil. As seedlings develop a very short taproot, the successful establishment of white-cedar requires not only adequate surface moisture for seed germination, but also available moisture within reach of the comparatively shallow root systems. Suitable seedbeds include moist rotting wood, sphagnum moss, and muck, which are all common in many swamps, and moist mineral soil. A thick litter of pine needles, or the leaves of shrubs and hardwood trees, is unfavorable. On one poorly drained site with a thick litter, removing the litter from seed spots increased germination from less than 1 percent on untreated areas to 13 percent on the cleared spots. Stocking of spots was 3 and 81 percent. Dense slash is extremely unfavorable for white-cedar establishment. In studies of natural reproduction on cutover areas, slash-free spots had at least 28 times as many seedlings as spots covered with dense slash (6). The microrelief of swamps also greatly affects seedling establishment. Spots where water stands on the surface during much of the year are unfavorable for both seed germination and seedling survival. Suitable conditions are limited to the hummocks above the usual water table, but on these hummocks seedlings may die during dry periods from insufficient moisture. In general, the younger or smaller the seedlings are, the greater the mortality from either drowning or drought. Relatively open conditions are essential for good survival and growth of white-cedar seedlings. At light intensities of 4 to 6 percent of full sunlight, as under mature white-cedar stands in New Jersey, seedlings survive for only 1 to 3 years. Partial cuttings that thin the overstory enable white-cedar reproduction to live longer, but not as long as competing hardwoods and shrubs. Under a light intensity of 77 percent, the initial growth of white-cedar seedlings was about twice that under a 16-percent intensity and almost 4 times that under a 2-percent intensity. Hence, only relatively open areas, such as abandoned cranberry bogs and clearcuttings, provide the conditions necessary for white-cedar seedlings to compete successfully with hardwood and shrub associates (6). Open-grown Atlantic white-cedar seedlings may reach an average height of 6 cm (2.5 in) on unfavorable sites (such as sandy, poorly drained soils or cranberry bogs) and 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) on favorable sites in the first year. In contrast, seedlings growing in swamps under heavy shade may reach a height of only 2.5 cm (1 in) and a taproot length of only 5 cm (2 in) during the same time. On favorable open sites, seedlings add 0.2 to 0.3 m (0.6 to 0.9 ft) to their height during the second year, and about 0.3 m (1 ft) a year for a few years thereafter. Under these conditions, stems 3 m (10 ft) tall may be 7 or 8 years old in the South and about 10 years old in the Northeast. On less favorable sites, however, they may grow to heights of only 1.2 to 2.1 m (4 to 7 ft) in 15 years (6). Vegetative Reproduction-White-cedar seedlings or saplings, if severely browsed or otherwise injured, will sometimes develop shoots from lateral branches or from dormant buds on the stem. One white-cedar seedling girdled by meadow mice produced 26 sprouts 2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) long at its base. Seedlings of this species when repeatedly browsed by deer may develop multiple stems through layering. From one such seedling 1 m (3 ft) tall, 14 additional stems 0.2 to 1.0 m (0.5 to 3.3 ft) tall developed. Growth of the layered stems is slow, however (6).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- On good sites white-cedar grows 0.3 to 0.5 m (1.0 to 1.5 ft) in height each year and 0.25 to 0.40 cm (0.10 to 0.15 in) in d.b.h. until trees are 40 to 50 years old. After 50 years, height growth slows, while diameter growth continues at about the same rate for an additional 50 years. Height growth essentially ceases at 100 years (6). Although white-cedar trees are relatively small, the basal area and volume of stands tend to be high because of the high stand density. On the basis of three 0.1 ha (0.25 acre) plots, one stand in Gates County, NC, had 68 m²/ha (294 ft²/acre) of basal area, 85 percent of which was white-cedar. Most of the trees of these plots were between 5 and 36 cm (2 and 14 in) in d.b.h. According to yield tables, basal areas may reach more than 69 m²/ha (300 ft²/acre). On areas with a site index at base age 50 years of 14 m (45 ft), 50-year-old stands may have 56 to 57 m²/ha (245 to 250 ft²/acre) of basal area and a total volume, including stumps and tops, of 322 m³/ha (4,600 ft³/acre). On a site index of 12 m (40 ft), a 60-year-old stand may have 4,200 stems per hectare (1,700/acre), yielding about 220 m³/ha (35 cords/acre) to an inside bark top diameter of 10 cm (4 in); a 70-year-old stand on a site index of 21 m (70 ft), 865 trees per hectare (350/acre) and 693 m³/ha (110 cords/acre). The yield to an inside-bark top diameter of 15 cm. (6 in) is 600 m³/ha (42,900 fbm/acre, International rule) at 60 years, and 1000 m³/ha (71,500 fbm/acre) at 100 years, both on a site index of 21 m (70 ft) (6). In southern New England (lat. 41° to 42° N.), mature white-cedars reach heights of 12 to 18 m (40 to 60 ft) and a d.b.h. of about 41 cm (16 in), although some have grown to 122 cm (48 in). Optimum development-a maximum height of 37 m (120 ft) and a d.b.h. of 152 cm (60 in)-- apparently occurred in the Virginia-North Carolina section at lat. 34° to 37° N. The maximum sizes for white-cedar in Alabama (approximately lat. 31° N.) are somewhat less: 24 to 27 m (80 to 90 ft) high, with d.b.h. rarely more than 61 cm. (24 in) (6). Potentially, white-cedar is a relatively long-lived species. According to one source, some trees have reached 1,000 years of age, although stand age rarely exceeds 200 years (6). Rooting Habit- Atlantic white-cedar has a shallow root system. In swamps where the lower soil layers are permanently saturated with water, the roots are confined chiefly to the upper 1 to 2 feet of peat. Where the water table occurs at lower levels and the soils are more deeply aerated, the roots often penetrate to greater depths. The small taproot formed during the first year is subsequently lost in the development of the strong superficial lateral roots. These are numerous but do not become large. Because of its characteristically shallow root system and weak root hold in the spongy organic soils, white-cedar cannot withstand severe winds, and many mature trees are felled in storms. Trees which have grown in dense stands on swamp peat never become windfirm, and consideration must be given this fact in planning the harvest of this species. Reaction to Competition- Atlantic white-cedar is more tolerant of shade than associated species such as gray birch and pitch pine, but much less tolerant than red maple, blackgum, sweetbay, and other hardwoods that form the climax on swamp sites in its range. It is most accurately classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. White-cedar reproduction can grow through, and eventually overtop, scattered to moderately dense shrubs such as highbush blueberry, although in the process the cedar shoots may become extremely slender, almost like grass. White-cedar is not sufficiently tolerant, however, to grow through dense shrub thickets or through a hardwood overstory (6). Damaging Agents- Crown fires kill white-cedar. Composition of the succeeding stand varies according to (1) the degree to which the forest floor is burned, (2) the age of the burned stand and thus the amount of viable seed stored in the forest floor, (3) the proximity to other sources of white-cedar seed, and (4) the stocking of hardwoods and shrubs in the understory. If fire burns deep enough to eliminate trees of all kinds, a pond (or open bog) or a cover of leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata) may result. If the hummocks remain above the water table, a new stand of Atlantic white-cedar or hardwoods usually develops. White-cedar on typical swamp sites is shallow rooted and subject to windthrow, especially in stands that have been opened by partial cuttings. Wind, often aided by snow or ice, is beneficial to hardwood understory development at times when white-cedar stands are gradually opened by the periodic windthrow or breakage of scattered trees; but extensive wind damage in one storm favors development of another white-cedar stand. Along the coast, salt water brought in by storm tides kills stands of various species, sometimes permitting a pure white-cedar stand (developing from seeds stored in the forest floor) to follow one composed largely of hardwoods (6). Few fungi attack Atlantic white-cedar, and damage is not usually serious. Keithia chamaecyparissi and Lophodermium juniperinum attack white-cedar foliage; Gymnosporangium ellisii sometimes causes a broom-like development of branches; G. biseptatum occasionally causes a spindle-shaped swelling of stems or branches. Roots may be attacked by Armillaria mellea, Heterobasidion annosum, or Phaeolus schweinitzii. The latter and Fomitopsis cajanderi may attack heartwood, although the heartwood of Atlantic white-cedar is very resistant to decay (7). White-cedar has no serious insect enemies, although larvae of the common bagworm (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) may feed on its foliage.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,14,1
"White-cedar grows on wet ground or in swamps, sometimes on sandy soils, but usually on muck, formerly called peat. Soils include the orders of Spodosols and Histosols. The muck ranges from a few centimeters to 12 m (40 ft) in depth and is generally acid, with pH often between 3.5 and 5.5. White-cedar is absent or uncommon in areas where muck is underlaid by clay or contains appreciable amounts of silt or clay (6). As its range is restricted principally to coastal areas and to wet or swampy ground, Atlantic white-cedar usually grows at low elevation. In southeastern New Jersey these typically range from about 1 m (3 ft), where white-cedars border the tidal marsh, to 43 m (140 ft) in some inland stands. The species currently grows in at least one upland bog in northern New Jersey at an elevation of 457 m (1,500 ft).",Soils and Topography,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,15,1
"The lightweight, straight-grained wood of Atlantic white-cedar is easily worked, resistant to decay, and shrinks and warps very little during seasoning. These characteristics probably govern its use today as much as they did in colonial times. In those times it was used for shingles, barrels, tanks, and small boats. Today it is still used where durability, light weight, and resistance to weathering are important considerations: telephone poles, piling, ties, siding, boat railing, and ice cream tubs. Atlantic white-cedar has limited value for wildlife-white-tailed deer browse its foliage-and is occasionally used as an ornamental (2,4).",Special Uses,Atlantic White-Cedar,chamaecyparis,thyoides,conifer,16,1

Flowering and Fruiting- In Puerto Rico, the white perfect flowers are borne annually on a stalk at the beginning of the wet season, mainly from May through late August, with occasional late autumn flowering. Fruits develop through the autumn with the principal fruit drop in winter and early spring (15). In Trinidad, ausubo flowers at the beginning of the dry season, January to February, and the fruit ripens by April and May (27). In both regions, good flowering and fruiting is at intervals of 3 to 4 years. At randomly placed collection stations comprised of 0.5 m² (5.4 ft²) screen baskets in the Subtropical Wet Forest of Puerto Rico, ausubo dropped some 70 fruits in 39 months. Of the species of trees observed, ausubo ranked 16th in number of fruits collected (15). Seed Production and Dissemination- Ausubo fruits are globose berries about 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter and usually contain a single, shiny, black seed, surrounded by a sweet, gummy pulp that is edible. Occasionally, two seeds per fruit are found (21,27). In unpublished experimental work conducted at the Institute of Tropical Forestry, 1,280 air-dried seeds per kilogram (580/lb) were counted. Cutting tests showed that 35 percent of the seeds were hollow. Moisture accounted for about 30 percent of the weight of the seeds. Seed dispersal is limited to the vicinity of the parent tree unless animals consume or carry the fruits. Agouti and other animals eat the fruit in Trinidad (27), while in Puerto Rico birds have been identified as dispersal agents. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeous and irregular over a long period, with some seed germinating in the second year. Trials in Trinidad yielded only 10 percent germination, and efforts to improve it by soaking in water or slightly cracking the seed were a failure (27). In Puerto Rico, 100 seeds per treatment were stored at room temperature and at 4° C (40° F) in paper sacks and sealed jars for periods of 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. A control was sown immediately. Germination for the treated seeds was essentially nil while the control showed 60 percent success. It was concluded that storage by the means tested was unsatisfactory. Seedlings in the wild are capable of growing under heavy shade and in herbaceous cover. Average height at the end of the first year is 12 cm (5 in), and after 5 years about 4.5 m (15 ft). Artificial regeneration is best attained by direct sowing of fruits or transplanting of potted seedlings Ausubo seeds should be sown in moist leaves because they are not capable of emerging from the soil (26). ""Limited success"" has been achieved with bare root plantings after I year in the nursery, but if seedling are left too long in the beds, the taproot proves to b a problem (27). In experimental work at the Institute of Tropical Forestry, seeds were sown in nursery beds in the su and under shaded conditions. After 10 months, those in the sun were twice as tall as the shade specimens. Direct out-planting of potted seedling under heavy shade in the limestone forest on the north coast showed survival rates greater than 9 percent after 10 months. The seedlings, however were sensitive to drought. Most had wilted and yellowed after a prolonged period without rain. Vegetative Reproduction- Except when quite young, ausubo does not coppice, nor does it produce root suckers (27).",Reproduction and Early Growth,"Ausubo, Balata",manikara,bidentata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Growth of ausubo is slow in the sapling stage, and slow to intermediate in the pole stage through maturity. Height is about 0.3 m (1 ft) at 1 year, and about 4.5 m (15 ft) in 5 years. Annual diameter increment in an early secondary stand in St. Just (table 2), where the stems ranged from 4 to 13 cm (1.6 to 5.1 in) in diameter, averaged 0.58 cm (0.23 in) over a 2-year period. On an understocked 0.4 ha (1 acre) plantation in Trinidad, after 21 years volume mean annual increment (MAI) averaged only 2.37 m³/ha (33.86 ft³/acre). Diameter and height MAI for plantations in both Trinidad and Puerto Rico show that the former varies from 0.51 to 0.81 cm (0.20 to 0.32 in), and the latter from 0.2 to 1.1 m (0.66 to 3.6 ft), depending on site (table 2). Measurements of annual diameter increments for 17 years in previously thinned Subtropical Wet Forest of the Luquillo Mountains shows an average annual growth of 0.51 to 0.58 cm (0.20 to 0.23 in). Rooting Habit- By 2 years of age, the selling has a taproot. When older, it has a strong, moderately deep root system making the species wind-firm (27). In the study of a single ausubo tree in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, a root-to-shoot-to-leaf ratio of 24 to 68 to 8 was found. Fibrous roots constituted 28 percent of the total root biomass (10). Reaction to Competition- Ausubo is classed as very tolerant of shade throughout most of its life. It regenerates and is capable of growing through sapling, pole, and immature stages in dense shade. Basal area and diameter growth, however, are more rapid in trees that are exposed to the sun (29). In Trinidad, it was ranked second among the more valuable timber species with regard to shade tolerance (27). Its slow growth in seedling stages exposes it to damage by grazing animals and results in low survival rate for the species. In Puerto Rico, ausubo has been transplanted under fairly dense shelterwood (24) with good survival and satisfactory growth. Ausubo was found on each of six permanent plots measured since the mid-1940's in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. On plots that normally contain 40 to 50 species per 0.4 hectare (1 acre), ausubo ranked 5th in density, and 10th in both basal area and volume (6). Recurrent measurement of all trees on these plots revealed a 30-year chronology of stand dynamics after a hurricane. Ausubo, a primary species, increased in dominance over time, doubling its proportion of stand basal area to 10.7 percent and tripling its stand biomass to 9.1 percent (12). Large size at maturity, a long life cycle, good root development, and tolerance of shade enable ausubo to persist for 300 to 400 years and emerge as one of the canopy species in the Luquillo Forest. Damaging Agents- Survival is hampered by the very slow rate of seedling growth, and the fact that during this stage ausubo is succulent and eaten by animals (27). The leaves are frequently darkened by a layer of sooty mold that probably reduces the amount of light received. In a study of microfungal populations on ausubo leaves, it was found that a statistically greater number of fungi were present on the leaves at lower levels of the canopy than at mid- and upper-levels (11). Ausubo tolerates exposure well. Along the north coast of Trinidad, several groups of trees grew in areas exposed to the full force of the northeasterly tradewinds. Marshall (27) observed that even the clearing of a site for the construction of a cabin, leaving numerous large ausubo isolated, apparently had no effect on their survivial. Some infestations have been observed. In Trinidad, large trees with hollow bases were infested with both termites and a fungus, but it was not determined which agent was the primary cause of infection (27). In Puerto Rico, a canker has been observed that results in the dieback of branches, but the causative agent is unknown (33). Perhaps the agent most damaging to ausubo is man. In the process of ""bleeding"" trees to obtain balata gum, trees may be indiscriminately slashed and later die. Sometimes they are felled to obtain the latex.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,"Ausubo, Balata",manikara,bidentata,hardwood,14,0
"In Puerto Rico, ausubo is native to acid, clay soils derived in situ, or deposited by alluvial or colluvia processes. Existing inventories indicate that it grow mainly on soils of the orders Inceptisol and Oxisol Parent rocks include andesites and limestone. In Trinidad, ausubo thrives on a variety of soils ranging from clays through sands, including rocky soils, and on several different geologic formations (27). Physiographically, it is found on slopes and flats, and in coves. In Trinidad it is common on hills, and in Puerto Rico, it attains its best development on alluvia plains. In Suriname, it is common along river banks (31)",Soils and Topography,"Ausubo, Balata",manikara,bidentata,hardwood,15,0
"The heartwood is light red when cut and turns to dark reddish brown when dry. The sapwood is whitish to pale brown. The wood is very hard, strong, fine textured, and heavy, with a specific gravity of 0.85. The wood rates excellent for boring, fair for planing, and poor for turning (21,22,23). It is difficult to air season and shows severe checking and warp if dried too fast (9). The wood finishes very well and resembles mahogany. It is resistant to the dry wood termite, Crytotermes brevis, in Puerto Rico (35), highly resistant to the subterranean termites, Coptotermes niger, Heterotermes convexinotatus, H. tennis, and Nasutitermes corniger, in Panama, but susceptible to marine borers. The wood is also very resistant to white- and brown-rot fungus (7,9,23) and is very durable in contact with the ground (28). Ausubo is one of the strongest and most attractive commercial woods in Puerto Rico. It is widely used in the tropics for railway sleepers, bridging, heavy construction, furniture, turnery, flooring, violin bows, and billiard cues. Its strength, high wear resistance, and durability qualify the timber for use in textile and pulpmill equipment (9,21,27). Its excellent steam-bending properties make it suitable for boat frames and other bent work (23). The tree is also tapped for balata gum which is similar to gutta-percha. In some areas, trees have yielded sap for more than 25 years (30). The latex is coagulated by fire or dried in the sun, and souvenirs or novelties are then fabricated (21). The sap from some of the species within the genus apparentlv can be used as a substitute for cow's milk. The latex has the consistency and taste of cream, but overindulgence in it can result in severe constipation.",Special Uses,"Ausubo, Balata",manikara,bidentata,hardwood,16,0
"Baldcypress is a dominant species in forest cover types Baldcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 101) and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102). It is an associate species in Cabbage Palmetto (Type 74), Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Type 92), Black Willow (Type 95), Pondcypress (Type 100), Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103), and Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Type 104) (17). Tree associates of baldcypress include water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), swamp tupelo (N. sylvatica var. biflora), red maple (Acer rubrum), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), southern magnolia (M. grandifolia), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and various oaks Quercus spp.), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), and pines Tinus spp.) (2,29,46). Lesser vegetation associates include common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), cattail (Typha latifolia), lizardtail (Saururus cernuus), and various hollies (Ilex spp.), viburnums (Viburnum spp.), lyonias (Lyonia spp.), sedges, grasses, and ferns (2,44). Baldcypress grows along streams that can deposit or remove soil to the extent that the soil surface, and consequently the depth to the water table, can fluctuate a few meters (several feet) during the life of a stand. Therefore, its understory and even arboreal associates can vary from species tolerant of prolonged flooding to species requiring well-drained conditions (44).",Associated Forest Cover,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,1,1
"Pondcypress is the dominant species in the forest cover type Pondcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 100) (17). It is an associate species in Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Type 83), Slash Pine (Type 84), Slash Pine-Hardwood (Type 85), Pond Pine (Type 98), Baldcypress (Type 101), Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103), and Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Type 104). The most common sites for pondcypress are the shallow ponds of the Coastal Plain. Here, its chief tree associate is swamp tupelo. Along the margins and on slightly elevated positions within the ponds, associates are pines (Pinus spp.), red maple, sweetbay, and loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus). Lesser vegetation associates include common buttonbush, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), viburnums, swamp privet (Forestiera acuminata), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), bitter gallberry (Ilex glabra), ferns, and vines (17). In addition to growing in the ponds of the Coastal Plain, pondcypress is found in some of the swamps along ""black water"" rivers and creeks, in Carolina bays, in the Okefenokee Swamp, and in pondcypress savannahs. On these various sites, associates of pond cypress include most of those listed above plus many others (2,46).",Associated Forest Cover,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,1,1
"Humid, moist subhumid, and dry subhumid climatic types occur within the range of baldcypress. Normal precipitation increases from about 1120 mm. (44 in) per year in southern Delaware and southern Illinois to about 1630 mm. (64 in) along the central Gulf Coast, then decreases to about 760 mm (30 in) in southeastern Texas (31). It should be noted, however, that baldcypress usually grows on intermittently flooded sites. Drainage, therefore, may be more important than rainfall in determining site suitability for baldcypress. The growing season within the natural range of baldcypress increases from about 190 days in southern Illinois to virtually 365 days in southern Florida, and average annual minimum temperatures increase from about -18° C (0° F) to about 4° C (40° F) across this range (31). Baldcypress trees planted in the Northeastern United States and southern Canada withstand minimum winter temperatures of -29° to -34° C (-20° to -29° F) (23). Thus, baldcypress can grow across a wide climatic range. Few seeds mature in the extreme northern part of the species' native range (44) however, and baldcypress grows best in warm climates (28).",Climate,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,2,1

"Recognized varieties of baldcypress are indicated in the introduction to this report. Baldcypress grows across a range of wetland sites and over a wide geographic area, however, so other races may exist. A cultivar, 'Pendens', having pendulous branches, has been developed (50). In Russia, hybridization of baldcypress with redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) has been reported (44). Genetic variation of baldcypress seed, cone, and nursery- seedling growth was explored in two geographic seed source studies incorporating seed collected along the Mississippi River flood plain from Illinois to Louisiana. Variation among seed sources and families-within-source was of significant magnitude to indicate a potential for genetic selection and gain in growth. However, no specific pattern of variation was noted (18,19,20).",Genetics,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,7,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- Baldcypress is monoecious. Male and female strobili mature in one growing season from buds formed the previous year. The male catkins are about 2 mm (0.08 in) in diameter and are borne in slender, purplish, drooping clusters 7 to 13 cm (3 to 5 in) long that are conspicuous during the winter on this deciduous conifer. Pollen is shed in March and April. Female conelets are found singly or in clusters of two or three. The globose cones turn from green to brownish purple as they mature from October to December. The cones are 13 to 36 mm (0.5 to 1.41 in) in diameter and consist of 9 to 15 4-sided scales that break away irregularly after maturity. Each scale can bear two irregular, triangle-shaped seeds that have thick, horny, warty coats and projecting flanges (19,39,44,45). Number of seeds per cone averages 16 and ranges from 2 to 34 (20). Cleaned seeds number from about 5600 to 18,430/kg (2,540 to 8,360/lb) (39,44,45). Seed Production and Dissemination- Some seeds are produced every year, and good seed crops occur at 3- to 5-year intervals (45). At maturity, the cone scales with their resin-coated seeds adhering to them, or sometimes entire cones, drop to the water or ground (42). This drop of mature seeds is often hastened by squirrels, which eat baldcypress seeds but usually drop several scales with undamaged seeds still attached from each cone that they pick (5). Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and are the most important means of seed dissemination (44). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (45). Under swamp conditions, germination generally takes place on a sphagnum moss or a wet-muck seedbed. Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water. On the other hand, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water. Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of 1 to 3 months after seedfall is required for germination (44). After germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season (10,12,13). Baldcypress seedlings can endure partial shading but require overhead light for good growth (49). Seedlings in swamps often reach heights of 20 to 75 cm (8 to 30 in) their first year (7). Growth is checked when a seedling is completely submerged by flooding, and prolonged submergence kills the seedling (44). In nurseries, Taxodium seeds show an apparent in ternal dormancy that can be overcome by various treatments that usually include cold stratification or submerging in water for 60 days (19). Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds (45). Seedlings usually reach 75 to 100 cm (30 to 40 in) in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery (49). Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was 81.4 cm (32 in) tall and 1.1 cm (0.43 in) in diameter (19). Control of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for baldcypress planted outside of swamps. Five years after planting baldcypress on a harrowed and bedded poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high but heights had increased only 30 cm (12 in), probably because of heavy herbaceous competition (25). Seedlings grown in a crawfish pond in Louisiana, where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged 2.9 m (9.7 ft) and 3.5 cm (1.4 in) d.b.h. after 5 years. However, a replicate of the same sources planted on an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same d.b.h. but a smaller average seedling height of 2.1 m (7.0 ft) (John R. Toliver, unpublished data). When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered averaged 3.7 m (12 ft) tall 3 years later (49). Vegetative Reproduction- Baldcypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts. Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter. However, survival of these sprouts is often poor and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees (10,13,38). Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays (44). In the only report on the rooting of baldcypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees 5 years old rooted better than those from older trees (30).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,13,1
"A sample of pondcypress seeds numbered 8 900/kg (4,040/lb) (45). Generally, the flowering characteristics, seeds, seeding habits, vegetative reproduction, and reaction to competition appear to be similar to those of baldcypress. Trees are monoecious, seeds are distributed by gravity and water, germination is epigeal, and the species is capable of sprouting and is classed as intermediate in its tolerance to shade. In shallow ponds, both soil and water conditions appear singularly favorable for pondcypress seed germination and early growth, for here natural reproduction is almost always uniformly abundant (44).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Baldcypress is reputed to be slow growing and very long-lived, but during some growing seasons, perhaps in response to soil-moisture fluctuations, many baldcypress appear to produce more than one ring of stemwood. Counting these false rings in with true annual rings has led to overestimations of ages and consequently to underestimations of growth rates. A study in three baldcypress plantations of known age revealed that on increment cores under magnification, true latewood appeared as narrow bands of small, thick-walled cells, and the stains that cause false latewood tended to disappear. The larger trees in the study had more apparent rings than smaller trees of the same age, and conventional ring counts averaged about 1.6 times the actual age (44). Many years before that study, an investigator having no trees of known age to confirm his age counts, but stating that he could distinguish the stains of false latewood from true latewood bands, concluded that trees 400 to 600 years old were common in many virgin stands of baldcypress and that a few trees reached about 1,200 years (44). Under forest conditions, baldcypress stems generally require about 200 years to reach sufficient size to yield a high proportion of heartwood lumber (28). Also at about age 200, height growth ceases (44). After this age many baldcypress slowly die back from the top as a fungus-caused rot progresses downward through the stem. Baldcypress is noted for the large size it can attain. In virgin forests, the largest trees were 215 to 365 cm (84 to 144 in) in d.b.h. and 43 to 46 m (140 to 150 ft) in height (44). In the 1982 ""National Register of Big Trees,"" the champion baldcypress, which grows in Louisiana, was reported to be 520.7 cm (205 in) in d.b.h. and 25 m (83 ft) tall (1). Baldcypress also is noted for its high merchantable yields. In virgin stands, yields of 112 to 196 m³/ha (8,000 to 14,000 fbm/acre) over tracts hundreds of hectares in extent were common, and some stands likely exceeded 1400 m/ha (100,000 fbm/acre). One tree in Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia scaled 168 m³ (12,000 fbm) (44). Some second-growth stands are approaching the yields of the best virgin stands. A 96-year-old stand in Mississippi contained 980 m³/ha (70,000 fbm/acre) and its crop trees averaged 36.3 m (119 ft) tall (49). A 63-year-old second-growth stand in Louisiana averaged 1,260 cypress and 258 swamp tupelo trees per hectare, respectively (504 and 103/acre), resulting in volumes of 409 and 107 m³/ha (6,356 and 1,423 ft³/acre), respectively (15). The sample is limited, but some plantations, at least, grow faster than natural stands. In Mississippi, one plantation established on abandoned cropland had dominants averaging 21 m (69 ft) tall at 41 years (49), and another plantation that had been cultivated or mowed for the first 10 years contained 175 m³/ha (2,333 ft³/acre) at age 31 and the 30 largest trees averaged 21.6 m (72 ft) tall and 36 cm (14.2 in.) d.b.h. Ten-year volume growth (from age 21 to 31 yrs) of the trees in this plantation was 77.5 m³/ha (1,033 ft³/acre) (29). Baldcypress grows well at high stand densities. From age 60 to 70 years, a baldcypress-hardwood. stand in Florida increased from 39 to 43 m³/ha (168 to 189 ft³/acre) in basal area and from 359 to 428 m³/ha (57 to 68 cords/acre) in volume. The baldcypress grew at a faster rate than the tupelo and sweetgum. Thinning plots within the stand to various densities at age 60 resulted in faster growth of individual crop trees, but in slower growth per unit area than for the unthinned part of the stand (33). Density was even higher in a second-growth stand of baldcypress in Mississippi: 61 m²/ha (265 ft²/acre) at age 78. Thinning that stand to 46 m²/ha (200 ft²/acre) increased growth through age 96 more than did no thinning or a heavier thinning (49). Volume growth of a 63-year-old second-growth stand in Louisiana, with an average density of 50 m²/ha (220 ft²/acre) in basal area, was 54 m³/ha (716 ft³/acre) over a 5-year period. Crown thinning in this stand increased diameter growth and appeared to increase sawtimber volume per hectare after 5 years. Heavier thinning intensities stimulated epicormic branching on many trees, which could lower log quality. However, the largest dominant crop trees were least affected by epicormic branching (15). Cypress swamps and other forested wetlands that receive periodic nutrient subsidies from floodwaters probably are some of the world's most productive ecosystems. The annual above-ground production of biomass in a baldcypress-ash floodplain forest in Florida was 15 700 kg/ha (14,000 lb/acre) (4). In comparison, terrestrial forest communities in the temperate region often produce 12 300 to 15 000 kg/ha (11,000 to 13,400 lb/acre) annually (11). Stillwater forested wetlands do not receive nutrient subsidies from floodwaters, and they have production rates comparable to, or lower than, those of terrestrial forests. Such wetlands, however, offer additional benefits such as storage of water and peat (4). Rooting Habit- Baldcypress seedlings develop a taproot (49), and at least some planted baldcypress up to 25 cm (10 in) in d.b.h. maintain taproots (43). Older, naturally seeded baldcypress in swamps develop several descending roots that provide anchorage, and numerous lateral roots from which rise peculiar conical structures known as ""knees"" (23). These knees vary in height from several centimeters to more than 3.7 m (12 ft), depending apparently upon the average water level of the site (44,47). Knees are less likely to form in absence of flooding or where permanently standing water is 30 cm (12 in) or more in depth (48). However, small knees have been observed on many trees not subjected to flooding (3) and it is not uncommon for ornamental trees to produce knees. Research has found no physiological function for cypress knees. They may be beneficial as aeration organs but are not of critical importance to survival (17). Knees may also help to anchor trees because they develop large masses of roots. The extensive root system along with a buttressed base make baldcypress windfirm in soft, wet soils. Even winds of hurricane force rarely overturn them (44). Reaction to Competition- The relative shade-tolerance of baldcypress has not been definitely established. Seeds often germinate in heavily shaded places but usually do not survive or develop into large trees (10,13). Most successful stands regenerate in large openings. The species grows slowly in partial shade but the best growth occurs with full overhead light. For these reasons, intermediate shade tolerance seems the most appropriate classification. In fully stocked stands baldcypress characteristically has a clean, smooth stem and small crown, readily pruning itself of branches, but in poorly stocked stands it is very limby (44). Damaging Agents- A fungus, Stereum taxodi, that causes a brown pocket rot known as ""pecky cypress"" attacks the heartwood of living baldcypress trees, especially the overmature ones. The fungus most frequently gains entrance in the crown and slowly works downward, sometimes destroying a considerable part of the heartwood at the base of the tree. The action of the fungus ceases when the tree is felled. The durability of baldcypress lumber, so far as is known, is not affected by the presence of pecky material (28,44). A few other fungi attack the sapwood and heartwood of baldcypress and a few needle and twig fungi have been reported, but none of these is known to cause serious damage (26). Several insects attack baldcypress, but damage is generally minor (21). However, the fruit tree leafroller, (Archips argyrospila), previously unreported on baldcypress, became epidemic in 1983, in the lower Atchafalaya Basin and adjoining drainages to the east and south in Louisiana. The leafroller larvae commence webbing and feeding on cypress needles as soon as buds break and small leaflets expand. Large-scale killing of trees has not been observed, but those suffering repeated leafroller defoliation show die-back. Mortality of pole-sized trees has been linked to defoliation (21). The cypress flea beetle (Systena marginalis) causes discoloration of foliage and the cypress looper (Anacamptodes pergracilis) causes defoliation (44). Another common defoliator is the bagworm (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) (42). The southern cypress bark beetle (Phloeosinus taxodii) tunnels beneath the bark of limbs and trunks (27). The baldcypress coneworm (Dioryctria pygmaeella) is a serious pest of cones of baldcypress and pondcypress, capable of destroying more than 75 percent of a single year's crop (34). Nutria (Myocastor coypu) often clip or uproot newly planted cypress seedlings before the root systems are fully established, thus killing the seedlings (12). Where high nutria populations occur, entire plantings are often destroyed in a few days. The Soil Conservation Service recommends cessation of baldcypress planting until control measures are found. To date, the only successful control has been placement of a chicken wire guard around each seedling (12). Deer and swamp rabbits clip seedlings above the ground and eat the tender stems and branches, but these seedlings generally resprout and continue to grow (18,44).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,14,1
"In the 1982 ""National Register of Big Trees,"" the champion pondcypress, which grows in Georgia, was reported to be 229 cm (90 in) in d.b.h. and 41.1 m (135 ft) tall (1). This is approaching the size of the larger baldcypress. Such giants, however, are much more rare among pondcypress than among baldcypress. Although little information is recorded about the growth rate of pondcypress, general observations indicate that the tree does not attain the age and large size of baldcypress, nor does it grow as fast. The smaller size and slower growth of pondcypress may be inherent but are also attributable to the poor site conditions under which the tree usually grows (44). Because of its generally thicker bark, pondcypress is more resistant to fire than baldcypress (24).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,14,1
"More than 90 percent of the natural baldcypress stands are on flat topography or in slight depressions at elevations of less than 30 m (100 ft) above sea level. The upper limit of its growth in the Mississippi Valley is at an elevation of about 150 m (500 ft). A few isolated stands occur at elevations of 300 to 530 m (1,000 to 1,750 ft) bordering deep hollows on the Edwards Plateau of Texas (44). Because baldcypress usually grows on nearly flat topography, little is known about its growth in relation to topographic factors. Baldcypress sites are characterized by frequent, prolonged flooding. Floodwaters may be 3 m (10 ft) deep or more and may flow at rates up to 6 km (4 mi) per hour or may be stagnant at times (17). Normally, baldcypress is found on intermittently flooded and very poorly drained phases of Spodosols, Ultisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Entisols (40). The native range of the species is in the thermic and hyperthermic soil temperature regimes. On the Atlantic Coastal Plain, baldcypress grows best in the bottom lands of ""red water"" rivers, which originate in the Piedmont and mountains and during floods deposit a reddish, nutrient-rich silt into the bottom lands. Growth is poorer on the less fertile, coarser textured soils of the bottom lands of ""black water"" rivers, which originate in the Coastal Plain and are dark-colored with organic matter. Besides these alluvial soils, there are broad interstream areas of baldcypress swamps where soils range from heavy clays to coarse sand to mucks and peats, and where site quality is extremely variable (41). Baldcypress also grows along estuaries near the coast but apparently cannot tolerate water containing more than 0.89 percent salt (36). Stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis of 1-year-old baldcypress seedlings was reduced when salinity exceeded three ppt (.003 percent), indicating that salt water intrusion can adversely affect cypress at much lower concentrations (37). Horticulturally, baldcypress can be grown on many upland soils, and it is seen in cities as a shade tree or ornamental.",Soils and Topography,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,15,1
"Pondcypress grows on the very poor and poorly drained phases of Spodosols and Ultisols (40) of the thermic and hyperthermic soil temperature regimes. Soils range from sands to clays to mucks to peats. Pondcypress occupies the shallow ponds and poorly drained areas of the Coastal Plain and rarely grows in the river and stream swamps as does baldcypress (44). There is evidence that pondcypress does not grow on soils with a pH above 6.8 and bald cypress does not grow on soils with a pH below 5.5 (35), but it is not known if the range in which both grow might be narrower than pH 5.5 to 6.8. Pondcypress sites in general are much less fertile than baldcypress sites. Pondcypress grows on more acid soils, and it seldom grows on sites that receive periodic subsidies of nutrients from floodwaters. Pondcypress stands almost always are found on flat topography or in slight depressions often called domes (16); therefore, little is known concerning growth of pondcypress in relation to higher topographic features.",Soils and Topography,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,15,1
"The unusual and pleasing appearance of baldcypress-its knees, buttressed base, massive bole, and irregular crown often festooned with Spanish moss-has led to its introduction as an ornamental in many parts of the world (3,45). Baldcypress seeds are eaten by wild turkeys, squirrels, evening grosbeaks, and wood ducks (6); they are a minor part of the diet of other waterfowl and wading birds (32); and they were an important food for the now-extinct Carolina parakeet (6). Large old baldcypress furnish unique habitats for some wildlife. Bald eagles and ospreys nest in the tops. Yellow-throated warblers forage in the Spanish moss or resurrection fern (Polypodium polypodioides) often found on old trees. Prothonotary warblers achieve their highest densities in baldcypress-tupelo stands where they find nesting cavities in old decaying baldcypress knees. Catfish spawn in submerged hollow cypress logs (22). Baldcypress wood has a multitude of uses and is well known for its ability to resist decay. Cypressene, an oil extracted from the wood, is believed to give baldcypress high decay resistance. Older baldcypress, particularly old-growth, virgin trees growing in the deep swamps, is known as tidewater redcypress and is considered to be very resistant to rot (3). For this reason, cypress wood has long been favored in the building construction, fences, planking in boats, river pilings, furniture, interior trim, cabinetry, sills, rafters, siding, flooring and shingles, garden boxes, greenhouses, and many other uses (3). However, second-growth baldcypress lack the decay resistant heartwood of the old-growth trees (8,9). At what age or size decay resistance develops is unknown, but wood from trees at least 63 years old is susceptible to rot (9). Caution is recommended in the use of lumber from these trees in exposed situations, and the wood should be treated if rot resistance is essential (3,9). Pecky cypress, caused by the fungus Stereum taxodii, is used in products where durability rather than water tightness is required, and in decorative wall paneling (14,28). Riverine swamps of baldcypress cause floodwaters to spread out, slow down, and infiltrate the soil. Thus, these stands reduce damage from floods and act as sediment and pollutant traps (46).",Special Uses,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,16,1
"Lumbermen commonly cut and sell pondcypress and baldcypress timber together without distinguishing between them (28). Pondcypress ponds, domes (or heads), and savannahs provide the only breeding opportunity for a number of tree frogs, toads, and salamanders; provide nesting sites and habitats for herons, egrets, and many other birds; and are watering places for the birds, mammals, and reptiles of the surrounding pinelands. These wet areas serve as recharge areas for surface aquifers, and research has shown that pondcypress domes can serve as tertiary sewage treatment facilities in improving water quality, recharging ground water, and possibly increasing pondcypress growth rates (46). Functions of these domes and cypress swamps are discussed in depth in the book ""Cypress Swamps"" (16).",Special Uses,Baldcypress,taxodium,distichum,conifer,16,1
"Tree species associated with balsam fir in the boreal region of Canada are black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (Picea glauca), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). In the more southerly northern forest region, additional associates include bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), tamarack (Larix laricina), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), and northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Red spruce (Picea rubens) is an important associate in New Brunswick and Maine. Occasional associates are balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), gray birch (Betula populifolia), red pine (Pinus resinosa), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and American elm (Ulmus americana) (10). Pure stands of balsam fir or stands in which balsam fir is the major component of growing stock make up the forest cover type Balsam Fir (Society of American Foresters Type 5) (10). Balsam fir is also a major component in two other eastern forest cover types: Red Spruce-Balsam Fir (Type 33) and Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir (Type 35). It is an associated species in 22 eastern forest cover types and in 4 western forest cover types. Common shrubs associated with balsam fir include beaked hazel (Coryluscornuta), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum), Canada yew (Taxus canadensis), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus var. strigosus), sheep-laurel (Kalmia angustifolia), and hobblebush (Viburnum lantanoides) (10,41). Among the herbaceous plants commonly found under balsam fir are twinflower (Linnaea borealis), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), starflower (Trientalis borealis), creeping snowberry (Gaultheria hispidula), sedges (Carex spp.), common woodsorrel (Oxalis montana), bluebead lily or cornlily (Clintonia borealis), painted trillium (Trillium undulatum), cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomea), sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum), Canada mayflower (Maianthemum canadense), and spinulose woodfern (Dryopteris spinulosa). Certain associations of shrubs, herbs, and mosses indicate forest site quality (41). The four main indicator associations, designated as Hylocomium/ Hypnum, Cornus/Maianthemum, Oxalis/Cornus, and Viburnum/Oxalis indicate, in the order listed, increasing productivity of site and increasing proportions of shrubs and hardwood trees in natural stands. Only the Hylocomium/Hypnum sites are likely to be occupied by pure balsam fir.",Associated Forest Cover,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,1,1
"Balsam fir grows best in the eastern part of its range in southeastern Canada and the Northeastern United States. This area is characterized by cool temperatures and abundant moisture. Growth is optimum in areas with a mean temperature of 2° to 4° C (35° to 40° F), a January average ranging from -18° to -12° C (0° to 10° F), a July mean temperature ranging from 16° to 18° C (60° to 65° F), and mean annual precipitation ranging from 760 to 1100 mm (30 to 43 in) (1). The mean annual temperature within the range of balsam fir varies from -4° to 7° C (25° to 45° F). Mean annual precipitation records show as much as 1400 mm (55 in) to as little as 390 mm (15 in). The amount of growing season precipitation is from 150 to 620 mm (6 to 25 in) (1). There are 80 to 180 frost-free days and about 110 days for optimum growth (1).",Climate,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,2,1
"No distinct races of balsam fir have been identified. Botanical varieties of balsam fir have been described, Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis being most important. This variety, the bracted balsam fir, is distinguished by its cone scales, which are shorter than the bracts. The variety phanerolepis is found infrequently from Labrador and Newfoundland to Maine and Ontario, and in the high mountains of New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It is found locally in northern Virginia and West Virginia (21,41,42), and commonly in several locations in Nova Scotia. Until the late 1930's, natural or artificial hybrids of balsam fir had not been reported in North America. There were earlier reports, however, of hybrids between balsam fir and Siberian fir (Abies sibirica) in Europe (1). Balsam fir is closely related to Fraser fir (A. fraseri). A taxon of doubtful status, A. intermedia, representing a possible cross between the two species, has been reported. This cross has also been reported as A. balsamea var. phanerolepis (1). Subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa) also may hybridize with balsam fir where they adjoin in Alberta (42). Workers in Canada apparently have been successful in some instances in hybridizing balsam fir with several species of Abies, among them European silver fir (A. alba), alpine fir, and Fraser fir (1). Similar attempts in the United States have been only partially successful. European horticulturists have propagated many forms of balsam fir for ornamental purposes. Plant form, needle color, and branch length and angle are characteristics usually manipulated. Nineteen such cultivars have been listed (1).",Hybrids,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,9,1
"In Canada, balsam fir extends from Newfoundland and Labrador west through the more northerly portions of Quebec and Ontario, in scattered stands through north-central Manitoba and Saskatchewan to the Peace River Valley in northwestern Alberta, then south for approximately 640 km (400 mi) to central Alberta, and east and south to southern Manitoba. In the United States, the range of balsam fir extends from extreme northern Minnesota west of Lake-of-the-Woods southeast to Iowa; east to central Wisconsin and central Michigan into New York and central Pennsylvania; then northeastward from Connecticut to the other New England States. The species is also present locally in the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia (23,30). Balsam fir grows from sea level to within 15 to 23 m (50 to 75 ft) below the 1917 m (6,288 ft) summit of Mount Washington in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. At this elevation prostrate balsam fir is found in sheltered areas (1). - The native range of balsam fir.",Native Range,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,11,1
"Variation in balsam fir appears to be clinal and continuous and related to altitudinal gradient and to both east-west and north-south geographic gradients. Variation has been explored in a number of studies. Balsam fir seedlings grown from seed collected along an elevational gradient in New Hampshire showed a clinal pattern of carbon dioxide uptake with respect to the elevational gradient. This suggests an adaption to temperature through natural selection (14). Another study failed to show that geographical variation in food quality of balsam fir needles is important to the spruce budworm diet but did suggest variation in food quality between locations (33). In the southern Appalachians the monoterpenes- alpha-pinene and beta-phellandrene- appear to be the best taxonomic characteristics for separating balsam fir from Fraser fir, with alpha-terpene increasing southward and beta-terpene increasing northward. Because no regional variation pattern was evident for wood specific gravity or tracheid length, it has been suggested that only one species of balsam fir with three varieties be recognized in the Eastern United States: Abies balsamea var. balsamea, Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis, and Abies balsamea var. fraseri (29,39). Balsam fir provenances from eastern portions of the range exhibited more vigor than those from western portions (24). This trait continued through 11 (22) and 13 years of total tree age (9). Southern sources tended to flush later, indicating selection for minimizing damage from the balsam gall midge (Dasineura balsamicola) and for resistance to late spring frost. Specific gravity and tracheid length generally vary along an east-west gradient, with eastern sources of lower specific gravity and longer tracheids (9). Generally, trees from slow-growing sources have higher specific gravities and shorter tracheids than trees from fast-growing sources.",Population Differences,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Exposure to light influences flowering in balsam fir. In New Brunswick, female strobili were observed on 83 percent of dominant, 59 percent of codominant, and 6 percent of intermediate trees. None were found on suppressed trees (41). Balsam fir is monoecious. In spring, 1 year before pollination, male (staminate) and female (ovulate or pistillate) strobili differentiate from flower buds. The strobili are microscopically recognizable at this time. Male strobili usually are distinguishable before the female strobili because they initially develop more rapidly. Flower buds usually open in late May or early June before vegetative buds (41) but have been reported as flowering as early as late April (42). Male strobili, yellowish-red and tinged with purple, develop in the axils of leaves along the undersides of the 1-year-old twigs, usually in dense clusters. Their position in the crown is mostly within 5 m (15 ft) of the top and is almost always below the female strobili. Female strobili are purplish and are found singly or in small groups, confined to the top 1.5 m (5 ft) of the crown. They are located on the upper side of the twig and, like the male strobili, develop on the previous year's twig. Flower production is best on the outer end of branches (41,42). At maturity, male flowers are about 3 mm (0.1 in) long; female flowers are about 25 mm (1.0 in) long (1). Pollen grains are yellow; when developed, their average diameter is 90 µ (0.00354 in). In one series of observations in Ontario, fertilization occurred on June 25 (1). The mature fruit is an erect cone 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long with short, round, irregularly notched scales and pointed tips. There are thin, closely overlapping fan-shaped scales near the center of the cone. The cone matures and ripens during the first fall in late August and early September. The scales and shorter bracts drop away with the seeds, leaving the central axis, which can persist for many years. Seed Production and Dissemination- Regular seed production probably begins after 20 to 30 years. Cone development has been reported for trees 15 years of age and younger and only 2 m (6.6 ft) tall. Good seed crops occur at intervals of 2 to 4 years, with some seed production usually occurring during intervening years (1). On the average, 35 L (bushel) containing 1,000 to 2,000 cones weighs approximately 16 kg (35 lb) and yields 1000 to 1200 g (35 to 42 oz) of cleaned seeds. The number of cleaned seeds per kilogram (2.2 lb) ranges from 66,000 to 208,000 and averages 131,000. These are about 134 seeds per cone (42). The seed yield of balsam fir ranged from 5.6 to 20.2 kg/ha (5 to 18 lb/acre) during several good seed years in Ontario (1). Over a 37-year period, annual seed production in this area averaged 1,950 seeds per square meter (181/ft²) (15). The period of balsam fir seedfall is long and dissemination distances vary. Seedfall begins late in August, peaks in September and October, and continues into November. Some seeds fall throughout the winter and into early spring. Most of the seeds are spread by wind-some to great distances over frozen snow-and some are spread by rodents. Although seeds may disseminate from 100 m (330 ft) to more than 160 m (525 ft), effective distances are 25 m to 60 m (80 to 200 ft) (1,11,28). Many seeds falling with the cone scales land close to the base of the tree. Balsam fir seeds have dormant embryos and should be stratified in moist sand at about 50 C (410 F) for at least 30 days before planting. Germination is epigeal (42). Seedling Development- Within the range of suitable temperatures, moisture is more important than light for germination. In fact, light intensities of only 10 percent of full sunlight result in successful germination (1). The low capacity of planted balsam fir seeds to germinate may be attributed in part to seed injury during the cleaning process. The age of the tree may also contribute to the viability of seeds. A study in Michigan (41) showed that germination was highest for a 41-year-old tree (68 percent), varied for trees 30 years old (8 to 57 percent), and was lowest for trees 155 years old (10 percent). Testing of 32 commercial seed lots showed average germination of about 26 percent with a range of 4 to 62 percent (42). Once the seed reaches the ground, its viability diminishes quickly and is gone within 1 year (13). It has been suggested, however, that in cold swamps viability of some seeds is retained for 2 to 3 years (1). Most germination occurs from late May to early July. Survival the first winter is questionable if germination occurs after mid-July (1). If enough moisture is available, almost any seedbed type is satisfactory, but mineral soil-neither too sandy nor too heavy-with some shade is best. Litter and humus are poor seedbeds, especially if moisture is inadequate or -light is excessive. Competition, often severe, makes heavy sod the poorest seedbed (11). A thick layer of duff exceeding about 8 cm (3 in) is less favorable for balsam fir but even worse for the slower growing associated spruces. Balsam fir seedlings may have a heavy central root, much like a taproot, that extends to the bottom of the humus layer and then splits into several laterals. In general, balsam fir roots grow more rapidly and penetrate deeper than red spruce roots. Where seasonal root elongation of young balsam fir growing in humus averaged 10.6 cm (4.2 in), red spruce was 7.6 cm (3.0 in), and white spruce 9.0 cm (3.5 in), or 39 percent and 18 percent less, respectively (1). Because the surface of thick duff usually dries out, there may be some delayed germination as late as August. Few seedlings become established, however. The closer seeds lie to mineral soil, the greater the initial establishment of seedlings. Seedlings starting in the open may sustain heavy mortality when surface temperatures exceed 46° to 54° C (115° to 130° F) or when there is drought or frost heaving. Seedlings may also be smothered or crushed by litter, ice, snow, and hardwood leaves. Losses after the first year usually are minor. As seedlings develop, light at intensities of at least 50 percent of full sunlight are necessary for optimum growth (11,41). Damage caused by late spring frost to new foliage of young seedlings is seldom severe. Balsam fir seedlings about 15 cm (6 in) tall can be considered to be established (11), especially if secondary branching has occurred. Early growth is then determined largely by the amount and character of dominant competition. Bracken, raspberry, and hardwood sprouts-especially the maples-are the chief competitors on heavily cutover lands in the Northeast. These species may increase dramatically when the original basal area is reduced by 50 percent or more and may dominate the site for 10 to 25 years (2). Unless there has been some soil disturbance, there will be little regeneration of balsam fir and spruce immediately following logging (45). Both balsam fir and the spruces can survive many years of suppression and still respond to release (11,41). The space required for the continual development and establishment of new seedlings probably exceeds that created by the removal of individual trees. To ensure successful regeneration relatively small groups of trees should be removed initially (12). Vegetative Reproduction- Layering is not an important means of regeneration except for prostrate balsam fir growing in the more northern and mountainous locations such as Isle Royale in Lake Superior, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Layering also occurs in open swamps and deep mossy areas and under white pine and jack pine overstories. Trees of any age apparently may layer. Second generations, vegetatively produced, develop when connecting tissues decay and separate (1). Balsam fir apparently grafts easily (41). In a study in New York, greenhouse grafts were 85 percent successful and field grafts were 80 percent successful. One attempt to air-layer balsam fir was unsuccessful (1). Balsam fir Christmas trees are stump cultured from lateral branches or adventitious shoots.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Balsam fir at maturity is small to medium size, depending on location and growing conditions. In general, heights range from 12 to 18 m (40 to 60 ft); diameters range from 30 to 46 cm. (12 to 18 in) at breast height (41). Where growth is optimum, as in the Green River watershed in New Brunswick, some trees can reach 27 m (90 ft) in height and 75 cm. (30 in) in d.b.h. The reported record d.b.h. for balsam fir is 86 cm (34 in). Maximum age is about 200 years (1). How large or how fast balsam fir grows, or how much a stand of balsam fir will yield is related to site factors such as biotic, climatic, and soil conditions, and to age. The condition of the tree or stand and the composition and structure of the stand also influence growth. Diameter growth was related to vigor and crown length-to-height ratio in a study in Maine. Balsam fir with high vigor and a ratio of at least 0.7- the proportion of live-crown length to total tree height averaged 6.1 cm (2.4 in) of growth in d.b.h. in 10 years. Less vigorous trees with smaller crown-length ratios ranged downward to an average of 1.0 cm (0.4 in) of growth in 10 years. Vigorous trees with room to grow attain a d.b.h. of at least 25 cm (10 in) in about 50 years (41). In uneven-aged stands of several density classes in Maine, balsam fir grew faster in diameter than spruce and hemlock (35). Data obtained from stem analysis of balsam fir growing on sites of varying quality in northern Maine has shown height growth curves to be polymorphic (fig. 1). Height growth varies with site quality. From these curves the average site index of a stand can be estimated (16). Monomorphic or harmonized site index curves for balsam fir are also available (17). Figure 1-Polymorphic site index curves (base age 50 years at breast height) for balsam fir in northern Maine, as derived from stem data (16). Balsam fir is a strong contender for space in stands in which it grows. A 20-year record of stands containing balsam fir in the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine showed that the periodic annual volume ingrowth of the species, as a proportion of total volume ingrowth, greatly exceeded its representation in the original stands (12). Because of its many natural enemies, however, volume mortality of balsam fir also greatly exceeds its original representation in these stands. Balsam fir accounted for 35 percent of the average annual net growth in predominantly softwood stands and 32 percent in mixed stands that were extensively managed. These stands were growing at annual rates of 3.5 m³/ha (49.3 ft³/acre) and 2.9 m³/ha (41.1 ft³/acre), respectively (31). Yields in total cubic-foot volume, including stump and top, of all trees larger than 1.5 cm (0.6 in), in d.b.h. are given in table 1. These yields are based on sample plots in even-aged spruce-fir stands, mostly on old fields. They tend to exaggerate the yields that might be expected from the irregular stands that develop after harvesting (41). Simulating the management and growth of forest stands containing balsam fir is possible because of advances in computer technology. A matrix model, FIBER (36), has been developed for stands in the Northeast. Even-aged and multi-aged stands, containing balsam fir, spruce, northern hardwoods, and other associated species, can be programmed to simulate a range of silvicultural treatments. In a ranking with both hardwoods and softwoods from around the world, balsam fir is highest with a total above-ground ovendry biomass at age 50 of 184 t/ha (82 tons/acre). Annual increment or annual net primary production averages 10.3 t/ha (4.6 tons/acre) (20). In New Brunswick (3), dry-matter production of balsam fir in pure stands increased dramatically with increases in stand densities of from 1,730 stems per hectare (700/acre) to 12,350/ha (5,000/acre). At an average age from release of 43 years, total above-ground biomass was 96 t/ha (43 tons/acre) for the least dense stand and 143 t/ha (64 tons/acre) for the most dense stand. Rooting Habit- Balsam fir root systems are mostly confined to the duff layer and to the upper few centimeters of mineral soil (11). Windfall potential is high. Damage from wind is especially likely when the shallow root systems are loosened by heavy rainfall and gusty winds and where timber removals from stands not previously thinned have been poorly conducted. These usually older, dense stands are susceptible probably because root development has been poor. Root penetration on deep or shallow soils extends to 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 in) and has been reported to a depth of 137 cm (54 in) in sandy soils in northern Ontario. Lateral roots of balsam fir are usually strongly developed and extend horizontally in all directions to 1.5 m (5 ft) or more (1). Root breakage and other root damage caused by swaying trees may not be as severe as is commonly thought. Most investigators agree, however, that some root breakage probably occurs because of frostheaving and swaying. During epidemics of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), rootlet mortality can reach 75 percent after 3 consecutive years of defoliation (1). Balsam fir root grafts are probably common and have been reported frequently. Abrasion of the bark of roots of swaying trees on lowland soils and interroot compatibility and growth pressure on upland soils apparently account for the majority of root grafts. Infection may spread through grafted roots to damage other balsam fir trees (1). Reaction to Competition- Balsam fir has a strong ability to become established and grow under the shade of larger trees (7,11). It is classified as very tolerant. Because relative tolerance of species may vary with soil fertility, climate, and age, balsam fir is rated as both more and less shade tolerant than red spruce, and more tolerant than either black or white spruce (41). Intraspecific competition is evident in many sapling and small pole-size stands of pure balsam fir. As these stands mature, dominance usually is expressed. Competition is severe in dense fir thickets, however, and growth rates of individual trees suffer greatly. Other major competition is from the shade-tolerant hardwoods. In New England, balsam fir is considered a subclimax type, except that it may be a climax species in the zone below timberline. It tends to become climax in Quebec and in the Lake States (41). Damaging Agents- Many agents act to hinder the growth of balsam fir. Insects and diseases may be devastating. Flammable needles, often close to the ground, shallow root systems, and thin resinous bark make balsam fir susceptible to severe damage and mortality from fire. Susceptibility to wind damage is especially high in old unmanaged stands growing on wet shallow soils. Various species of mice, voles, and birds consume balsam fir seed; birds and squirrels nip buds; and black bears girdle mature trees. Balsam fir has several insect enemies, the most important by far being the spruce budworm. Despite its name, the spruce budworm prefers fir over spruce; it is most likely to cause heavy damage and mortality in stands that contain mature fir, or that have a dense stocking of fir or a high proportion of fir in relation to other species. Vast budworm outbreaks in eastern North America, perhaps as many as 11 since 1704, have killed tens of millions of cubic meters (hundreds of millions of ft³) of balsam fir (6). Defoliation causes extensive root mortality. Evidence of budworm attack such as deformation, buried leaders, and decay can be seen 40 or more years later (1). Detailed articles about this important insect pest, with suggestions to alleviate damage, have been written (7,32) and a comprehensive bibliography assembled (25). A classification system for tree vigor and budworm resistance was developed as a guide for selecting spruce and fir trees to remove or retain so as to make spruce-fir stands less vulnerable to spruce budworm attack. Silvicultural techniques designed to increase stand resistance to budworm cannot achieve their aim in the short term; several stand entries over the long term may be required, especially in stands dominated by balsam fir regeneration (46). The balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae), an introduced insect, is found in Southeastern Canada and in the Northeastern United States. Unless checked by low winter temperatures, populations build up and weaken or kill many trees. Severe stem attack can kill trees within 3 years. The insect also attacks twigs and buds, causing swellings and resulting in loss of new buds, gradual death of twigs and tops, and severe damage to regeneration. An abnormal growth of tracheids caused by insect saliva results in dark, brittle ""redwood"" (41). The red heart fungus (Haematostereum sanguinolentum), causes much decay in living balsam fir. It enters almost entirely through injuries to the trunk and living branches (18). Losses from red heart rot are two or three times greater than those caused by butt rots (11,41). Six root and butt rots in balsam fir are economically important. These include the shoestring rot (Armillaria mellea), the two brown cubical rots (Tyromyces balsameus and Coniophora puteana), and the three white stringy rots (Poria subacida, Resinicium bicolor, and Scytinostroma galactinium). Another root disease of importance is Serpula himantioides. Phaeolus schweinitzii and Inonotus tomentosus also cause a small percentage of the root and butt rot in balsam fir (18). Mechanical or insect-caused wounds to the roots or basal areas of trees provide entrances for these fungi (41). Although the root and butt rots are not responsible for an excessive amount of cull in standing trees, they do weaken trees and make them more susceptible to wind damage, especially if trees are 20 cm (8 in) d.b.h. and larger. The defect caused by these rots is severe enough to be the decisive factor in setting the pathological rotation of fir at about 70 years (11,18,41). Rot can begin in balsam fir as early as 40 years and increases as the trees get older. More than half generally are infected by the time they are 70 years old. No reliable external indicator of rot is known and even fruiting bodies are rare on living trees. Site seems to have an effect on the incidence and severity of rot; generally, the drier the site, the greater the damage from rot (41). Specific causes of seedling diseases in nurseries have not been thoroughly reported. The foliage diseases of balsam fir are many but none are economically important to wood production. The same can be said for balsam fir's many stem or canker diseases (18). The most conspicuous disease of balsam fir is witches' broom, caused by the rust fungus Melampsorella caryophyllacearum. Broomed shoots are upright and dwarfed and have yellow needles. Trunk and branch swellings are produced in the shoots (18).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,14,1
"Balsam fir grows on a wide range of inorganic and organic soils originating from glaciation and generally falling within the acid Spodosol, Inceptisol, and Histosol soil orders. These are characterized by a thick mor humus and a well-defined A2 horizon, usually gray in appearance because of leaching, and commonly caused by abundant rainfall, cool climate, and coniferous cover. Many of the glacial till soils in New England are shallow and have a compact layer about 46 cm (18 in) below the surface (11). Soil moisture was the most important predictor of site index in a study in Newfoundland. Soil nutrient status and topography, in that order, were of lesser importance. Glacial tills, often shallow, cover much of the area (27). Balsam fir has been reported as growing on soils of a wide range of acidity. In the northern Lake States it is most common on cool, wet-mesic sites with pH values between 5.1 to 6.0 (19). Optimum growth occurs on soils where the pH of the upper organic layers is between 6.5 and 7.0 (1). On gravelly sands and in peat swamps, growth is comparatively slow (41).",Soils and Topography,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,15,1
"The most important products made from balsam fir wood are pulpwood and lumber (43). The wood of balsam fir, as well as that of other true firs, is creamy white to pale brown. The sapwood has little odor or taste. Wood structure in the true firs is so similar that identification of species is impossible by examining only the wood (1,43). Balsam fir is pulped by all of the pulping processes. Sulfate and semichemical processes are used most extensively. A fiber length of 3 to 4 mm A 12 to 0.16 in) is good, as is fiber quality. Because balsam fir is less dense than other major pulpwood species, its yield is lower (37). The wood of balsam fir is light in weight, relatively soft, low in shock resistance, and has good splitting resistance. Recent testing of several mechanical properties of balsam fir and of red, white, and black spruce indicates strength values for balsam fir generally exceeding those of white spruce. In some tests, strength values were equivalent to or only slightly below the values of red and black spruce (5,34). Nail-holding capacity is low. Balsam fir is very low in resistance to decay (43). The major use of balsam fir lumber is for light-frame construction. Minor uses include paneling, crates, and other products not requiring high structural strength. Balsam fir provides food or cover for some animals and both food and cover for others. Moose rely on balsam fir in winter when it is a major source of food. The use of balsam fir by deer for cover and shelter is well documented. During severe winter weather, especially in northern areas of the white-tailed deer range, lowland balsam fir stands and spruce-balsam fir swamps are used extensively as winter yarding areas. The fact that these sites usually contain, at best, only small amounts of preferred food suggests their attractiveness as shelter. Other mammals use balsam fir to varying degrees. The snowshoe hare uses it for cover, and there is some seed and phloem feeding by various species of mice and voles. Red squirrels occasionally feed on balsam fir seed, bark, and wood. They prefer flower buds to vegetative buds. There is some use of wood by beaver for dam building, but little is used as food. Black bear strip bark and lick the exposed surfaces between bark and wood (1). Balsam fir provides a minor part of the diet for both the spruce grouse and the ruffed grouse. Buds, tips, and needles are consumed, and more feeding occurs in winter than in summer. Thickets of balsam fir provide shelter for both birds (1). The response of bird populations to several forestry practices in stands containing balsam fir has been recorded (8,40). Species composition, the vertical and horizontal structure of the stand, and the extent of spruce budworm infestation influence the composition and density of bird populations. Balsam fir is not widely planted as an ornamental nor does it offer much potential in areas other than northern New England, Canada, and perhaps the Lake States. Plantings as screens or as windbreaks are successful only when the moisture requirement of the species is met (1). On certain lands and especially on public lands, the unique presence of spruce-fir stands suggests management for esthetic values. In the southern Appalachian mountains, coniferous forests containing balsam fir are managed for watershed protection (44). Oleoresin, a substance confined to the bark blisters of balsam fir, is used as a medium for mounting microscopic specimens and as a cement for various parts of optical systems. It is also used in the manufacture of medicinal compounds and spirit varnishes (4). Balsam fir wood is not prized for fuelwood, but industries that use balsam fir for pulp and lumber products are using increasingly larger quantities of wood waste for the production of energy. The heating value of ovendry fir bark is 21 166 600 joules/kg (9,100 Btu/lb) (26). The fir tree has been a favorite Christmas tree for more than 400 years. It remains among the top three species. In 1980, balsam fir ranked second behind Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), commanding 13.9 percent of the market (38). Sheared plantation-grown trees are usually preferred over wildings by retailers and consumers. Wreath-making is another holiday business that rivals that of Christmas tree sales in some areas. Prolonged needle retention after harvest, color, and pleasant fragrance are characteristics of balsam fir that make it attractive for these uses. Fragrance alone accounts for use of the needles as stuffing for souvenir pillows commonly sold in New England gift shops.",Special Uses,Balsam Fir,abies,balsamea,conifer,16,1
"Balsam poplar occurs in the following forest cover types (13): Balsam Poplar (Society of American Foresters Type 203), White Spruce-Aspen (Type 251), White Spruce (Types 107 and 201), Jack Pine (Type 1), Aspen (Type 16), Red Spruce-Balsam Fir (Type 33), Northern White-Cedar (Type 37), Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39). In eastern North America, balsam poplar is found mainly in mixed stands where other species dominate. In Saskatchewan, it is a component of the following forest types: Aspen-hazelnut (Populus tremuloides/Corylus cornuta), white spruce (Picea glauca)-feathermoss, aspen-sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis)/twinflower (Linnaea borealis), white spruce/aspen-bunchberry (Cornus canadensis)/bishops cap (Mitella nuda), black spruce (Picea mariana)feathermoss, and white spruce-horsetail (Equisetum spp.) (31). Balsam poplar is uncommon in boreal white spruce forests east of about 75° longitude and is not present in black spruce stands east of 85 to 86° longitude. It grows with white spruce east of 75° longitude, however (45). Other associated trees are balsam fir (Abies balsamea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), American elm (Ulmus americana), red maple (Acer rubrum), tamarack (Larix laricina), and northern white-cedar (Thuja canadensis). In western and northern parts of the range, balsam poplar is associated with balsam/alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), aspen, paper birch, white spruce, and black spruce on upland sites. It reaches its most widespread development on the river flood plains. On these sites, it occurs in pure stands and is associated with mountain alder (Alnus incana) and various willows (e.g., Salix alaxensis, S. interior) during early stand development and white spruce in later stages when it finally disappears from these sites (53,57). Low shrubs associated with balsam poplar include redosier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), bunchberry, mountain maple (Acer spicatum), bearberry honeysuckle (Lonicera involucrata), beaked hazel, American cranberry bush (Viburnum trilobum), highbush cranberry (V edule), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus var. canadensis and strigosus), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), devil's club (Oplopanax horridum), and red currant (Ribes triste). Some associated herbaceous plants are horsetails (Equisetum arvense, E. pratense), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), bedstraws (Galium boreale, G. triflorum), fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), panicle bluebells (Mertensia paniculata), red baneberry (Actaea rubra), alpine pyrola (Pyrola asarifolia), claspleaf twistedstalk (Streptopus amplexifolius), wild sarsaparilla, butterbur (Petasites spp.), and bishops cap. In mixed stands, various feathermosses (e.g., Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi) and lichens may be associated with balsam poplar. In Alaska, two mosses, Eurhynchium pulchellum and Mnium cuspidatum, have been reported in flood plain stands (53). Moss and lichen cover is generally low in these stands.",Associated Forest Cover,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,1,0
"Most of the range of balsam poplar has a continental climate, but some is in the maritime zone and the transition between these two broad regions. Average temperature ranges from -30° to -4° C (- 22° to 25° F) in January and from 12° to 24° C (53° to 75° F) in July. The lowest temperatures range from -18° to -62° C (-10° to -79° F); the highest from 30° to 44° C (85° to 110° F). Annual precipitation is lowest in central Alaska (15 to 30 cm; 6 to 12 in) in the Yukon-Tanana drainage. The highest precipitation, 140 cm (55 in), occurs in the Maritime Provinces of eastern Canada. Distribution of precipitation varies throughout the range, but prolonged summer droughts are uncommon. Annual snowfall is lowest in interior Alaska (100 to 200 cm; 40 to 80 in) and highest in Newfoundland (400 cm; 160 in). Maximum summer daylength varies from 16 to 24 hours. Minimum daylength in winter drops to zero above the Arctic Circle. The frost-free period varies from 75 to 160 days. The longest growing seasons are in the southern part of the range and the shortest in the north, but growing seasons can be 120 days in parts of Alaska.",Climate,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,2,0
"Balsam poplar is in the section Tacamahaca of the genus Populus (24). Two varieties have been identified: the typical variety Populus balsamifera var. balsamifera and P balsamifera var. subcordata, found in eastern Canada (2). Balsam poplar and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) have hybridized and produced mixed populations. Because of this intermixing, black cottonwood has been suggested as a subspecies (i.e., Populus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa) (2,37). Where balsam poplar and black cottonwood overlap, hybrids with a range of characters intermediate to those of the two species are found. An index using capsule shape, capsule pubescence, and carpel number has been developed (2,55). Other hybrids have been reported between balsam poplar and P alba, P. laurifolia, P nigra, R simonii, P. sauveolens, P. tremula, and P tristis (7,37,69).",Genetics,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,7,0
"The range of balsam poplar spans about 110° in longitude (55° to 165° W.) and 26° in latitude (42° to 68° N.). It extends across North America along the northern limit of trees from Newfoundland, Labrador, and Quebec west to Hudson Bay and northwest to Mackenzie Bay. From northwest Alaska, its range extends south to southwest Alaska and part of southcentral Alaska, north and east British Columbia; east to southeast Saskatchewan, east North Dakota, northeast South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, northwest Indiana, Michigan, southern Ontario, New York, and Maine. It is local in the western mountains, south to northeast Oregon, Idaho, extreme northern Utah, central Colorado, extreme northwest Nebraska, and the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. It is also scattered in northern Iowa, northeast Ohio, Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, extreme eastern Maryland, and northwestern Connecticut. -The native range of balsam poplar.",Native Range,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Balsam poplar generally reaches flowering age between 8 and 10 years. It produces large seed crops almost every year, but significant annual variation in production can occur by individual stands and trees (47,59). Flowering in this dioecious species occurs before leaf flush, in April and May throughout most of the range, but not until June or July at northern limits and upper elevations. The regional ratio of male to female clones was found to be 1:1 on treeline sites in northern Quebec. Female clones occurred on sites with a relatively milder climate or those that were more fertile and mesic; male clones were more common on inland sites with drier soil conditions. Most stands were made up of more than one clone; however, monoclonal stands usually contained a male clone, and polyclonal stands usually had only female clones. Stand density and area were greater in male than in female clones (6). Flower clusters (catkins) are 5 to 9 cm (2 to 3.5 in) with many small flowers about 3 mm (0.12 in) long. Male flowers have 20 to 30 reddish stamens. Mature female catkins are 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) long. Capsules are a lustrous green during development but turn dull green at time of dispersal. Male flowers are shed promptly and decay; female catkins are shed shortly after dispersal is completed but remain identifiable for the remainder of the summer (2,56). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are tan and small (0.3 mg or 0.005 gr); they do not have an endosperm at maturity. Dispersal begins in May and June throughout most of the range, but dissemination can occur through the last week of July in northernmost stands (33,59). Dispersal of seeds lasts for at least 2 weeks. Viable seeds are found on trees 4 to 6 weeks after the start of dispersal in some years. Relatively warm, dry weather causes rapid dispersal. Each small seed is attached to a tuft of long, silky hair ideally suited for long distance dispersal by the wind. Under warm, dry conditions, seeds are frequently carried upward by convection currents. Large quantities of seeds fall within the stand, however, and large numbers of short-lived germinants can be found on suitable substrates in mature stands (59). On flood plain sites, large quantities of seeds land in water and may be carried long distances by rivers. Seeds sink rapidly, however, when detached from the silky hairs. Although most balsam poplar seeds die within several weeks of dispersal, some remain viable for 4 to 5 weeks. Duration of viability is dependent on temperature and moisture; cooler, drier conditions prolong viability. Viability can be maintained at 90 percent or greater for at least 3 years when seed is stored in airtight containers at -10° C (14° F) (4,63,65). Seedling Development- The seed does not exhibit dormancy, and germination occurs over a wide range of temperatures (5° to 35° C; 41° to 95° F) provided moisture is adequate (63). Germination can occur under water, and even mild water deficits reduce germination (33). Germination is reduced by exposure to the concentrations of salt that commonly occur as crusts on river flood plains (33). In a comparison of germination on different types of naturally occurring substrates, balsam poplar germinated over a wider range of substrate moisture content on sand-algal crusts than on silt, sand, or silt-salt crust substrates (33). Complete germination occurs in the dark and over a range of overstory conditions (59). Burial of seed up to several millimeters does not prevent germination but reduces it. Germination is epigeal and can occur after the seed has separated from the silky hair or in association with the hairs. Under ideal conditions, germination is rapid, and cotyledons can be expanded in 18 to 24 hours (33,64). The rate of germination declines below 15° to 20° C (59° to 68° F) (64). A conspicuous ring of fine hairs is formed at the root-hypocotyl junction. These hairs anchor the seedling to the substrate until the radicle provides a more substantial foothold. Moist mineral soil surfaces are the best seedbeds. Seeds germinate on moist organic seedbeds, but seedling survival is poor, and most seedlings die soon after germination (6,59,67). Seedling development depends on photosynthesis soon after germination. After the first growing season, hypocotyl length varies from 2 to 5 mm (0.08 to 0.20 in) under Alaska conditions. Tricotyledonous seedlings do occur, but they are rare. Albinism can be as high as 5 percent in some seed lots in Alaska. Leaf production begins with the development of two leaves separated by 0 to 4 mm (0 to 0.16 in); the first leaf is I to 3 min (0.04 to 0.12 in) above the cotyledons. Subsequent leaf production and internode development vary by microsite and with seedling density, with maximum production of 11 leaves under field conditions in Alaska. The third and fourth internodes are the longest (25). The height and dry weight of first-year seedlings are affected by density (25,39). Seedlings grown in a greenhouse from an Ontario seed source ranged from 5 to 32 cm (2 to 12.5 in) in height and 11 to 220 mg (0.17 to 3.4 gr) per plant as density decreased from about 59,000 to 323 seedlings/m² (39). Seedlings grown under normal environmental conditions in interior Alaska ranged from 2 to 6 cm (0.8 to 2.4 in) tall at sowing densities ranging from 73,400 to 1 seeds/m² (6,820 to 0.1/ft²). First-year shoot growth was proleptic with no branch formation unless the apex was damaged. Dry weight of leaves and stems ranged from 20 to 520 mg (0.3 to 8.0 gr) (25). Average root length varied from 9 to 13 cm (3.5 to 5.1 in). On flood plain sites, height growth of planted seedlings in early successional stages was twice that in later stages. Growth appeared to be controlled by nitrogen availability in some stages of succession and a combination of light, water, and nutrient availability in other stages. In greenhouse studies, balsam poplar seedling biomass was greater on soils from alder stands than on those from earlier successional stages, suggesting that poplar benefits from nitrogen fixation. The growth of seedlings on early successional soils increased significantly when they were fertilized, but growth on alder soils was not affected by fertilization (58). Natural seedlings were found only in the early successional stages, and growth rate was similar in each of these stages. Vegetative Reproduction- Balsam poplar is one of the most versatile members of the Salicaceae in its potential for vegetative reproduction. New stems originating from intact or broken roots, preformed or adventitious buds on stumps or at the base of trees, and buried stems or branches have been observed in primary or secondary succession on flood plain and upland sites (33,66,69). In Alaska, segments of stems and branches broken and buried during autumn logging contribute to regeneration. This buried material was from 2 to 6 cm (0.8 to 2.4 in) in diameter and 10 to 200 cm (4 to 79 in) long (69). Dormant hardwood stem cuttings, as old as 10 to 15 years and probably older, will produce roots and new shoots. Older cuttings frequently take longer to root than younger cuttings. The distal portion of the current year's growth may root more poorly than the basal part of the current growth and 2-year-old wood. In a rooting study conducted with material from Ontario, cuttings collected after December had a higher percentage of rooting, more roots per cutting, and a higher percentage of cuttings with bud activity than those collected before December. Age of the parent tree had no effect on number of roots produced or bud activity (8). Clonal differences are a major source of variation in rooting percentage and the number of primary roots produced by dormant cuttings (15). Rooting potential for hardwood cuttings ranges from 75 to 100 percent (8,24); rooting of softwood cuttings ranges from 23 to 63 percent, depending on treatment (24). Unrooted stem sections have been used with varying success in regeneration of field sites. In one study in Alaska, survival after 3 years ranged from 15 to 82 percent. Highest survival was observed on gravel substrates, least on silt and sand soils. Third-year height was greatest on silt and sand-1.2 m (3.9 ft) (28). In a prescribed bum, survival after 5 years was generally low; microsites burned to mineral soil supported the best growth. Relatively deep organic layers, whether burned or unburned, provide a poor environment for the establishment of unrooted stem cuttings (65,66). Stem cuttings (hardwood and softwood or greenwood cuttings) have been the major means of stand establishment for the short-rotation intensive culture of balsam poplar and hybrid poplars in Wisconsin, Ontario, and other areas (20). Hardwood cuttings are grown in clonal orchards, harvested, stored, and planted either rooted or unrooted. Clones that are difficult to root may survive better if they are regenerated from rooted cuttings. Greenwood cuttings provide a means of rapidly increasing the number of desirable clones, but they must be rooted before planting (20). In the greenhouse, root cuttings of balsam poplar clones from Utah produced surface suckers from suppressed buds and end suckers from the cambium at the cut end (46). Root cuttings also produce new lateral roots from the same origins as suckers. Alaskan clones respond similarly (69). Production of suckers after disturbance of the parent tree varies; the response is generally less than that of aspen which suckers prolifically. In Alaska, stocking after 3 years ranged from 4 to 61 percent; densities were 1 to 2 plants/m² (3 to 8/milacre) in harvested balsam poplar stands. Suckers made up about 80 percent of the stocking in the summer- and winter-logged areas but only 27 percent in a fall-harvested area. Production was on intact and broken roots within the upper 2 cm (0.8 in) of the surface soil. Average diameter of roots producing suckers was 1 cm (0.4 in) (69). In a 40- to 50-year-old stand on the Tanana River in interior Alaska, stocking was 83 percent and density 2 trees/m² (8/milacre) (25). In Saskatchewan, sucker regeneration was observed on dry, moist, and wet regimes. Stocking was 12 percent in the aspen-hazelnut type; 5 percent in the white spruce-aspen-bunchberry type; 5 percent in the white spruce/feathermoss type; and 7 percent in the aspen/sarsaparilla/twinflower type (31). Density of suckers is greatest on sites where the organic layers are disturbed. Organic layers are effective insulators and may limit sprouting by controlling soil temperature, particularly in high latitude forests (69). Production of suckers may be important in the invasion and establishment of balsam poplar on disturbed sites and in primary succession. Expansion has been observed on flood plains from established stands to areas that did not have poplar (40). Colonization by clonal expansion is believed to be more important on dry sites where the probability of seedling establishment is low (33). The area covered by individual clones on productive forest sites is not well documented; one 15-year-old clone consisted of 27 ramets and covered an area of 350 m² (3,700 ft²) (33). The extent of clonal development is best documented at elevational and latitudinal treeline sites where seedling establishment is limited and development of stands through vegetative growth is the main means of colonization and maintenance of the species (6,35). Scattered groves of balsam poplar in the Brooks and Alaska Ranges of Alaska were found to be individual clones. Representative clones covered from 100 to 200 m² (1,060 to 2,110 ft²) and contained from 90 to 150 ramets. Clones with the oldest ramets (114 years old) were found on the Brooks Range sites. Ramets did not occur in areas with dense shrub cover (35). New shoots also form on stumps from suppressed buds and adventitious buds developed from undifferentiated inner bark. Most originate in the inner bark at the top of the stump. Sprouting response varies with genotype and declines as tree age increases. It may be high (50 to 100/stump) initially, but production and survival of sprouts vary with season and logging method. The percentage of stumps with sprouts declines over a 2- to 5-year period (69). Balsam poplar stump sprouts may be of little potential value in replacement of trees in mature stands after disturbance because of the fragile connection between sprout and stump. In intensively cultured stands grown on short rotations, coppicing is used to replace the new crop after harvest of the original stand established from stem cuttings. Individual cuttings may produce 10 to 20 sprouts I year after harvesting; 4 to 8 sprouts will survive after 2 years (20). The growth potential of balsam poplar vegetative reproduction is greater than that of early seedling growth. Average height of balsam poplar was about 1 m (3.2 ft) after 3 years; height of dominants was 2.5 to 3.0 m (8.1 to 9.8 ft). The age of suckers at breast height (1.5 m or 4.9 ft) varies with site quality and the degree and type of disturbance (21,25). The most detailed data available for growth of vegetative reproduction comes from stands of a P. balsamifera x tristis hybrid established from stem cuttings. After harvest of the original stands, coppice stands are managed for several rotations. Mean annual increment (stem plus branchwood) is 21 to 25 t/ha (9.5 to 11.0 tons/acre), depending on stand age and rotation length (11). Other studies with this hybrid have shown that 1- and 2-year-old coppice stands are taller and more productive than stands of similar age established from stem cuttings. Architecturally, the stands are different in that each individual in coppice stands has 10 to 20 stems at age 1 and 4 to 8 stems at age 2. Stands from stem cuttings usually contain one stem per individual at this age (20). Internode length on young vegetative regeneration is usually greatest in the lower part of the annual shoot. Buds are longest in the central part of the shoot, and the terminal bud is equal to the largest nodal bud. First-order branches are smallest at the base of the previous year's growth and longest near the top. Angle of divergence of first-order branches is 30° to 40° (37).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield -Large balsam poplar throughout much of the range may be 90 to 180 cm (35 to 71 in) in diameter and 23 to 30 in (75 to 100 ft) in height (44). In the northern part of the range, this species is frequently the largest tree in 80- to 100-year-old stands. Beyond this age, conifers, which eventually replace balsam poplar, usually attain greater heights but not necessarily larger diameters. The form or branching pattern of young trees is excurrent, with a clearly defined main bole and conical crown. In the 80- to 100-year-old age class, trees tend to have a more rounded crown, however, and the central stem gives rise to a more deliquescent or decurrent growth habit. On good sites the excurrent growth habit is present to at least 40 to 50 years. On poorer sites, the decurrent growth habit may occur earlier. The branching system is composed of long and short shoots; short shoots produce most of the leaves. Long shoots account for height growth and lateral branch extension. Balsam poplar vegetative buds exhibit unconditional dormancy in the fall and early winter. A brief chilling period removes this dormancy, however, and by early February, buds are largely in a state of imposed dormancy with active growth commencing as soon as the temperature is high enough (14). Specific gravity of balsam poplar wood ranges from 0.326 to 0.346 and differs among sites. Within individual trees, specific gravity varies from 0.318 to 0.429 and is greatest at the top of the tree. Fiber length ranges from 1.02 mm (0.04 in) at breast height to 0.78 mm (0.03 in) at a bole position of 75 percent of total height. Sapwood pH averages 5.40 and heartwood 8.12. No significant differences were found among male and female clones in pH or wood and bark extractives. Lignin content of wood was higher in the sapwood than in the heartwood; bark lignin content was three times greater than that of the wood (32,48). Balsam poplar stands are generally even-aged, with some variation. On upland sites in Saskatchewan, the greatest age span is about 17 years, but most stands have an age range of 5 years or less (10). Age spans are 20 to 25 years or less in young stands and 50 to 60 years in 155- to 165-year-old stands occupying flood plain sites in northeast British Columbia (40). The greatest age spans have been observed in the poplar groves characteristic of treeline stands. Clones in Alaska treeline stands have ramets ranging in age from I to more than 100 years old. New suckers tend to be produced at the periphery of the clone (35). Stand density varies with stand history. The density of stems larger than 2.5 cm (1 in) varies from 8700/ha (3,250/acre) in 25-year-old stands to 225/ha (91/acre) in 200-year-old stands (53). In southern portions of the species' range, stand density is not well documented but is probably lower than in northern areas because balsam poplar does not normally occur in large pure stands. In Wisconsin, balsam poplar made up less than 2 percent of the total stand volume in the types where it was present (for example, balsam fir-white spruce, aspen, and tamarack) (12). In mixed-wood sections, balsam poplar makes up 7 percent of the total volume and annual growth (31), but this percentage varies with site type and drainage (table 1). Total balsam poplar biomass estimates in Alaska range from 75 t/ha (33 tons/acre) in the Yukon River drainage to 180 t/ha (80 tons/acre) on the Tanana River flood plain for 60-year-old stands (29,68). In Alberta, aboveground dry weight for trees 16 to 65 years old varied from 0.45 to 251 kg (0.99 to 553 lb); 33 to 71 percent of this weight was in the main stem (30). Forest survey reports for Alaska indicate that, in unmanaged stands, balsam poplar (or the hybrid with P trichocarpa) has a mean annual increment of from 4 to 6 m³/ha (57 to 86 ft³/acre) in the Susitna Valley. Site indices (base age 100 years) in British Columbia range from 6 to 12 ft (low) to 34 to 42 ft (good) (21). Rooting Habit- On flood plains, the balsam poplar root system is multilayered, owing to the deposition of new soil by periodic flooding. Although early root development is downward, subsequent development progresses upward as root development occurs on the buried stem. In one instance, major new root development occurred at least six times as the initial root system and 2 in (6.6 ft) of the main bole were buried by silt deposition during a 30- to 40-year period (40). Root development on the buried stem of seedlings occurs within several weeks of burial and appears to be associated with the presence of preformed root primordia (8,34). Expansion of the root system and subsequent sucker production can play an important role in clone development and colonization of a site after the seedling ortet becomes established. Extension of lateral roots 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 in) in diameter has been observed to be at least 14 m (46 ft) in 15-year-old clones. Expansion of the root system ranged between 0.5 and 8.0 m (1.6 and 26 ft) in a 15-year-old clone; maximum rate of expansion occurred between 5 and 9 years (33). Root system expansion determined from clone size and age appears to be lower at treeline than at lower elevations where clones of about the same size occur but are 6 to 10 times older (6,33,35.). On sites without active soil deposition, formation of the root system is predominantly downward and lateral. Depth of rooting is restricted on the relatively wet sites where balsam poplar is commonly found. Lateral root spread on upland sites is at least 8 to 12 in (26 to 39 ft). Reaction to Competition- Balsam poplar shows all the characteristics of an early successional species: that is, low shade tolerance, rapid juvenile growth, prolific seed production, relatively short life span, good self-pruning, and replacement by more tolerant associates. It is most accurately classed as very intolerant of shade. In primary succession on river flood plains, balsam poplar is an early invader and is associated with various willows and alder for about 20 years after formation (53). It appears to assume dominance as a result of greater stature and relative growth rate than willow and alder, which precede it in succession, and white spruce, which follows it (58,59). It may have an allelopathic effect on alder germination and germinant development, but these effects have not been substantiated under field conditions (27,58,59). Balsam poplar bud extracts inhibit nitrification under laboratory conditions, indicating the potential for nitrogen conservation within poplar stands and an effect on forest development and succession (49). It is the dominant species for about 50 years. White spruce gradually replaces balsam poplar, and by age 100 to 150 years, the poplar is a minor component of the stand. Deviations from this general pattern include the Yukon and Susitna Rivers where poplar stands more than 200 years old occur, and white spruce is a minor species present mainly in the understory. Balsam poplar can be important in secondary succession on bums and cutovers or primary succession on lakeshores and sites severely disturbed by mining and construction. Asexual and sexual reproduction are important in burned and cutover areas, but only sexual reproduction is important on severely disturbed sites. Balsam poplar can reproduce asexually under stand conditions, but the suckers are short lived. Damaging Agents- Susceptibility of balsam poplar to fire is determined by characteristics of individual trees and stands. Thickness of bark increases with age, giving increased resistance to fire; however, the bark of mature trees tends to be deeply fissured, and the protection afforded the cambium is less than if a continuous sheath surrounded it. Mature trees can withstand mild and perhaps moderately intense fires. Balsam poplar supports crown fires only under the severest burning conditions (41). Fire fuels differ in the various vegetation types where balsam poplar occurs. Pure stands of balsam poplar support fires of less intensity than those in mixed conifer-hardwood stands, and tree survival is greater. Early successional stands containing only hardwoods are less likely to burn intensely than later successional stages or mixed balsam poplar-conifer stands (41). Balsam poplar produces root suckers after fire, and burned sites can be colonized by seed reproduction when mineral soil seedbeds are created. As rivers create sites for establishment of balsam poplar, they also destroy sites with established stands. This process can be gradual as the river slowly undermines its bank at the rate of a few feet per year, or the erosion can be dramatic. It is not uncommon to see river channels change by 30 to 60 m (100 to 200 ft) in several years. These channel changes can destroy significant areas of established poplar stands. Moose, deer, elk, and other animals browse on balsam poplar stem material but eat little foliage (3). Stems as large as 5 cm (2 in) d.b.h. may be broken by moose and the tops browsed. Where browsing occurs for only 1 or 2 years, however, form is not adversely affected because subapical buds rapidly replace damaged terminals. Simulated browsing of 9 to 14-year-old poplars resulted in increased twig biomass, indicating that only under the severest, repeated browsing is it adversely affected (16). Resin of balsam poplar appears to repel snowshoe hares, and foliar buds have higher resin contents than internodes. As a result, hares may eat internodes of twigs and stems but not the buds (3,38). High terpene and phenolic resin content are sufficient to reduce cellulose digestion, making balsam poplar less palatable to animals (43). Girdling by hares or rodents can kill saplings or small trees above the girdle, but dormant buds from below the girdle usually form a new stem. Ruffed grouse may feed on staminate buds in the winter. Beaver frequently cut balsam poplar growing along watercourses; usually, sprouts are not produced or, if they are, they either die or are browsed and subsequently die. On small streams, ponds created by beaver dams can kill poplars growing in or adjacent to ponded areas. The poplar and willow wood borer (Cryptorhynchus lapathi), bronze poplar borer (Agrilus liargus), and the poplar borer (Saperda calcarata) are among the most damaging insects. They girdle or badly weaken trees larger than 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter by tunneling in the main stem and limbs (9). The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), satin moth (Sti1pnotia salicis), gray willow leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta decora decora), and aspen leaf beetle (Chrysomela crotchi) feed on balsam poplar foliage, but the species is not their principal host (1). The highly resinous buds and leaves of balsam poplar may render them relatively less palatable than the principal tree hosts (3). In mature trees, the most common decay-causing fungal species is Phellinus tremulae with Pholiota destruens, Corticium expallens, and Bjerkandra adusta also being important. A canker caused by Neofabraea populi has been observed on balsam poplar in Ontario less than 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter (22,23). The occurrence of decay varies with site conditions and among clones, with the latter appearing to be the most important cause of resistance (23). Infection by Rhytidiella moroformis causes a roughening of the normally smooth bark and the formation of deep furrows. Melampsora spp.cause a leaf rust and Linospora spp., a leaf blight (22). Venturia populina causes a leaf and twig blight and can stunt the main stem. Septoria musiva and S. populicola cause a leaf spot and canker on balsam poplar seedlings. Septoria musiva was reported to cause the highest percentage of canker and leaf spot in southern Manitoba. Septoria incidence on native poplars within their range is negligible (61). Frost damage occurs to trees of all ages in exposed stands established after bums and logging, in nursery stooling beds, and in plantations of hybrid poplar (60). Entire twigs may be shed. Distortion from frost damage occurs adjacent to cankers, and dieback results in burl formation, bud proliferation, sucker production, and uneven development of bark, leaf, and sapwood (60).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,14,0
"Maximum development of balsam poplar stands occurs on the river flood plains in Alaska, Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and Alberta. Balsam poplar can become established shortly after formation of a sand or gravel bar. At 15 to 25 years after site formation, it assumes dominance and retains it for 50 to 75 years, disappearing 100 to 200 years after site formation (40,51). During stand development, depth of medium to fine sand and silt-textured material accumulates from a few centimeters to as much as 2 to 3 m (6.6 to 9.8 ft). Periodic flooding occurs at spring breakup and in later summer-sometimes both; duration and degree of flooding depend on terrace height and distance from the river (40). The soil that develops consists of river sediment and organic matter in alternating layers of variable thickness. In northeast British Columbia, average annual rate of sediment accumulation was estimated to be 6 to 10 cm (2.4 to 3.9 in) from site age 0 to 50; beyond age 50, accumulation was estimated at 8 mm (0.3 in) (40). Balsam poplar grows primarily on soils of the order Inceptisols and, to a lesser extent, of the order Entisols. Before balsam poplar becomes dominant on a site, the river is the predominant influence on soil development. As balsam poplar becomes dominant, the vegetation becomes of equal importance in soil development (50,51). This results from the continuous aerial plant cover and increased litter (leaf) fall and decreased rate of siltation. In the balsam poplar stage, (a) forest floor nitrogen content increases while soil nitrogen remains relatively constant; (b) soil carbon and cation exchange capacity increase; (c) sulfate concentration, the major component of a salt crust common in early stages of succession, declines; and (d) depth and importance of the forest floor increases (51). Soil temperatures in balsam poplar stands are cooler than in earlier stages of succession but warmer than the white spruce stands that succeed them. Soils are usually thawed to a depth of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) or more by May. Soil temperatures during the growing season vary from 8° to 14° C (46° to 57° F) (53). Permafrost has been reported on only the most northern sites; for example, permafrost is found at a depth of about I m (3.3 ft) during the growing season along the delta of the Mackenzie River, where summer soil temperatures in the surface 0.5 m (1.6 ft) range from 2° to 10° C (36° to 50° F) during the growing season (18). On Alaska flood plain sites, soil pH was 6.9 to 8.2; nitrogen, 0.6 to 0.01 percent; phosphorus, 7.0 to 0.3 parts per million; and cation exchange capacity, 13.1 to 5.6 me/100 g (66). The roots of balsam poplar in young stands can extract water from near the water table and the capillary zone above it. As stands age, the importance of water supplied by rain and snow increases. In the eastern portion of the range and on upland sites in the west portion, balsam poplar occurs on soils developed from lacustrian deposits, glacial till, outwash, and loess. In Saskatchewan, it is frequently associated with aspen on moderately well-drained sites, but its distribution is usually restricted to local depressions or drainage channels (10,31). A higher proportion of balsam poplar relative to aspen in the white spruce-feathermoss ecosystem indicates sites that have excess water in early spring (31). It was the only one of seven boreal tree species that was associated with clay soils and was found on poorly drained sites having a pH greater than 7.2 (10). Balsam poplar grows in ""hotter"" ecoclimates and ""fresh"" to ""wetter"" soils in the moderate, humid site regions of eastern and central Ontario. In moist, subhumid western Ontario, it most commonly occurs on fresh to wetter soils in the areas of ""normal"" ecoclimate. In Ontario, balsam poplar occurs on sites that are relatively rich in nutrients and less acidic (19). In the open, subarctic woodlands in northern Ontario, balsam poplar and white spruce form the only closed forests, and these grow in river bottoms (5). Balsam poplar grows on dry, sandy, southfacing sites near treeline in Canada. The northernmost balsam poplar stands are associated with warm springs that arise in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range in Alaska. This area is in the zone of continuous permafrost, and these stands are forested islands in a sea of arctic tundra.",Soils and Topography,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,15,0
"Natural stands are generally described as underutilized, but its use is increasing as hardwood utilization increases in the mixed-wood section of the boreal forest. Although the wood can be used for a variety of products (for example, pulp, veneer, core stock, boxes, crates, brackets), species such as aspen and cottonwood are preferred. Waferboard with excellent mechanical qualities can be produced from balsam poplar; however, special procedures are needed to efficiently waferize the wood (17,42). In northern areas, balsam poplar is used for structural lumber and milled house logs when other species are not available. Balsam poplar hybrids have a potential for a variety of uses. Populus balsamifera x R deltoides (Populus x jackii) are used as windbreak and shelterwood plantings in the northern plains region. Other balsam poplar hybrids are being tested in short rotation, intensive culture plantations. When properly cultivated, irrigated, and fertilized, these hybrids yield about three or four times as much biomass as native aspen in northern Wisconsin. The resulting pulpwood is of acceptable quality. The foliage and small woody component can be converted to an animal feed supplement (26,70). Balsam poplar and its hybrids are used or have potential value in urban forestry and soil stabilization projects, particularly in the northern portion of the range and in the plains area of western Canada where the number of indigenous species available for these purposes is limited. In urban situations, however, balsam poplar has several undesirable traits. The branches of older trees tend to be brittle, female trees produce large amounts of residue from the spent catkins, and relatively rapid root suckering can result in unwanted colonization of lawns, sidewalks, and roadways. Anyone that has ever walked into a poplar stand in the spring at bud break is impressed with the fragrance in the air. This fragrance comes from the volatile compounds in the buds and other parts of the tree. These compounds have been identified and may have useful biological and esthetic properties (38). Various extracts from the winter buds of poplar were recognized by native peoples as having therapeutic value. For example, a salve or ointment (balm of Gilead) made by heating the winter buds in oil was used to relieve congestion (52). In recent years, the bark has been collected and carved into figures that are sold in gift shops.",Special Uses,Balsam Poplar,populus,balsamifera,hardwood,16,0
"Bigcone Douglas-fir has been listed in at least three vegetation classifications. One author placed the species in the California Coast Range forest, considering it an endemic and relic species. Another suggested that, in the San Bernardino Mountains at least, bigcone Douglas-fir was a member of the Live Oak Woodland and the Bigcone Douglas-fir vegetation types (4). Among forest cover types, bigcone Douglas-fir is listed as a common associate in Canyon Live Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 249) (5). Bigcone Douglas-fir occupies an intermediate position between the lower elevation chaparral zone and the higher elevation mixed-conifer forest. It ranges downward into the chaparral as far as moisture conditions permit, and upward among the pines and firs as far as severe climate allows. Bigcone Douglas-fir does not extend solidly between the two types, however. The species is found in patches, in groups, and as single trees scattered among the oaks and chaparral. The continuity of stands also is broken by cliffs, slides, and areas of adverse soil. Evidence suggesting that bigcone Douglas-fir has long occupied its present natural range is available from the fossil record. A likely progenitor of the species has been found in both the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (6). Fire, or its absence, greatly influences the extent and makeup of bigcone Douglas-fir stands. In general, repeated fires kill bigcone Douglas-fir, leaving only oaks or chaparral. Less frequent, but more catastrophic fires limit bigcone Douglas-fir to scattered large trees. When fires are infrequent, stands with several size and age classes develop; when fires are absent, multi-aged stands having at least some regeneration evolve (7). In recent large fires in the eastern Transverse Range, nearly 60 percent of the trees escaped defoliation and 15 percent sprouted later, for a survival rate of 75 percent. Trees appear to have survived primarily because they were growing with large tree-size canyon live oaks (Quercus chrysolepis), and in rough, broken terrain. Large canyon live oaks apparently act as a buffer against severe combustion characteristics of the chaparral nearby, and rough terrain impedes the speed and intensity of a conflagration. Survival of bigcone Douglas-fir on slopes of less than 20 degrees was only 37 percent. On slopes greater than 40 degrees, survival was more than 90 percent (10). Throughout its natural range, bigcone Douglas-fir is almost inseparable from canyon live oak. They form a community that is remarkably stable, self-perpetuating, somewhat exclusive, and probably climax in terms of succession. In the future, only minor shifts in species composition within the community are likely (7). In addition to canyon live oak, other tree associates, particularly at high elevations, are ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), singleleaf pinyon (P. monophylla), and sugar pine (P. lambertiana), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), and California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana). At middle elevations, tree associates are Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), Digger pine (P. sabiniana), California black oak Quercus kelloggii), two-petal ash (Fraxinus dipetala), and California-laurel (Umbellularia californica). Singleleaf pinyon and knobcone pines (Pinus attenuata), as well as curlleaf (Cercocarpus ledifolius) and birchleaf mountain-mahogany (C. betuloides) also are locally present. At lower elevations bigcone Douglas-fir, along with bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), is found in riparian settings, often in deep ravines, where it escapes fire. Coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), California scrub oak Quercus dumosa), birchleaf mountain-mahogany, laurel sumac (Rhus laurina), sugar sumac (R. ovata), and occasionally southern California walnut (Juglans californica) are associates of bigcone Douglas-fir (3) at lower elevations, mostly in nonriparian settings. Many woody shrubs are found with bigcone Douglas-fir (table 1). At middle and high elevations, although scarce beneath bigcone Douglas-fir and canyon live oak crowns, they flourish in open spaces between trees or on edges of thickets. At low elevations, shrubs become abundant and well developed around scattered large firs. A number of herbaceous species are scattered beneath bigcone Douglas-fir trees. Plants are relatively scarce and small because necessary nutrients, moisture, and light, already captured by the taller and deeper-rooted species, often are not available.",Associated Forest Cover,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,1,1
"The bigcone Douglas-fir habitat has long hot summers and cool moist winters. Extremes of annual precipitation vary from less than 250 mm (10 in) to 1270 mm (50 in), with 510 to 1020 mm (20 to 40 in) more common. The 30-year average at 1325 m (4,350 ft) elevation on a north aspect in the San Gabriel Mountains near Glendora, CA, was 610 mm (24 in). The lowest annual precipitation recorded was 250 mm (9.9 in) and the highest 1240 mm (49 in). Snowpacks persist rarely in the range of the species, except at high elevations. Snow may fall, however, as early as October, or as late as May. During the rainy season, fog has been reported to add to the moisture available for tree growth (14,15). During the summer, thunderstorms, hailstorms, or cloudbursts are common on higher mountains. Because much of this precipitation quickly evaporates, it does not foster tree growth (15). Specific temperature data within the range of bigcone Douglas-fir have not been reported other than for one station at 730-m (2,400-ft) elevation in the San Gabriel Mountains. The 22-year average mean for November through April was 9° ± 2° C (49° ± 3.7° F). Highs of above 27° C (80° F) and lows of below freezing were recorded in each of the 6 months. Annual temperatures at low to middle elevations in the mountain ranges of southern California where bigcone Douglas-fir grows seldom exceed 41° C (106° F) or drop below -12° C (10° F).",Climate,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,2,1
"Varieties or natural hybrids of bigcone Douglas-fir are not known, but an artificial cross of bigcone Douglas-fir and coast Douglas-fir was achieved in 1956 at Oregon State University, Corvallis. Hybrid seedlings indicated low mortality, good height growth, and a dense fibrous root system. They showed promise for outplanting on drier sites in the Douglas-fir region (2).",Genetics,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,7,1
"The range of bigcone Douglas-fir is about 217 km (135 mi) from north to south and about 338 km (210 mi) from east to west. Distribution of the species, in general, is confined to the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges of southern California. It is found on Mount Pinos, technically in the Tehachapi Mountains but considered transitional between them and the Transverse Ranges. Northern limits are near Mount Pinos in Kern County, and the headwaters of Labrea Creek in Santa Barbara County. Westernmost limits are Mission Canyon in the Santa Ynez Mountains, and Zaca Peak in the San Rafael Mountains. Older publications claimed that bigcone Douglas-fir grew in central Baja California, Mexico; a more recent publication verifies that it does not (11). The southern limit of the species is near Julian, San Diego County. - The native range of bigcone Douglas-fir.",Native Range,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Throughout most of its natural range, bigcone Douglas-fir flowers from early March through mid-April. Male flowers generally shed pollen before female flowers become receptive-a mechanism that facilitates cross-pollination and prevents selfing. The plant is monoecious. Pollination in a given locality lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Fertilized conelets begin to enlarge in mid-July and are easily seen soon after. Cones generally begin to dry and turn brown in August or September and most seed is released in September and October. Seeds are large and heavy and each has a rounded wing about 13 mm. (0.5 in) long. Mature cones are rich dark brown and range from 11 to 17 em (4 to 7 in) long. Some cones fall during winter, but others remain on the tree for at least a year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Cone crops of bigcone Douglas-fir usually are small. Bumper crops are infrequent. Small amounts of seed, however, are borne on a few trees nearly every year. The minimum cone-bearing age of the species is about 20 years, but cones are rare on trees younger than 40 years. Most seeds fall beneath tree crowns and only during high winds is wider dissemination possible. Insect larvae destroy some seeds in each cone crop and, at times, most of the crop. Rodents and birds consume seeds and aid in dispersal by distributing them beyond existing stands. Deer mice, chipmunks, ground squirrels, and the western gray squirrel eat large amounts of available seeds. The squirrels often bury seeds; some of these escape notice and eventually germinate. Seedling Development- Natural seedbed requirements for germination are broad. Seeds of bigcone Douglas-fir have been observed to germinate successfully on the bare mineral soils of rocky outcrops and geomorphically active areas. They also germinate well in deep litter, usually beneath an overstory of oak and bigcone fir, but heavy losses from damping-off fungi often take their toll of tiny seedlings in this environment. Germination is epigeal. Time of germination varies with elevation. In the chaparral zone, germination begins in late March. At higher elevations, germination ends in late May, or occasionally, early June. Seed quality tends to be poor, as indicated in such early descriptions as ""large number imperfect"" and 49 a considerable percentage not fertile"" (14,15). In a laboratory test of seed stratified for 28 days in moist vermiculite with a day temperature of 30° C (86° F) and night temperature of 20° C (68° F), 31 percent of seeds germinated. Weather, especially rainfall, can be critical to germination and early abundance of bigcone Douglas-fir seedlings. In the Santa Ana Mountains, 24,700 seedlings per hectare (10,000/acre) were present after a rainy period preceded by a year of above-average precipitation. The seedling environment, however, was not reported. New seedlings were absent during dry years (1). Bigcone Douglas-fir does not reproduce in stands having frequent fires, nor do badly damaged stands seed back to bigcone Douglas-fir, except during a series of wet years after a severe fire. Infertile seed, destruction of seed by fire, consumption of seed by birds and rodents, and lack of suitable microsites are possible reasons for scanty reproduction. Lack of shade could be another reason. Throughout its range, bigcone Douglas-fir reproduces most abundantly in locales undisturbed for at least 50 years, especially if shaded by canyon live oak trees. Where present, seedlings ranged in density from 140 to 1,030/ha (56 to 416/acre), with an average of 330/ha (132/acre). Advance reproduction, plants smaller than 2.5 cm (1.0 in) in d.b.h., was similar in mean and range of density (7). Artificial regeneration of bigcone Douglas-fir began in 1905, with outplantings in Los Angeles County. Survival was about 1 percent. The species was planted extensively (9,880 seedlings per hectare or 4,000/acre) for watershed rehabilitation from 1925 to 1930 by the Los Angeles County Forestry Department. From 1953 to 1975, this Department outplanted some bigcone Douglas-firs in all but 4 years (13). Survival, unfortunately, is unknown. Additional information on artificial regeneration of bigcone Douglas-fir is scanty. One small trial took place on a harsh site in Shasta County. Seed was germinated in a greenhouse in 1.9-liter (0.5-gal) milk cartons and 20 seedlings were outplanted as plugs when 1 year old. After five growing seasons in the field, survival was 65 percent and height averaged 53 cm (21 in) with a range of 18 to 76 cm (7 to 30 in). Early height growth of bigcone Douglas-fir seedlings is slow, especially in deep shade. The species develops a taproot in early years, possibly at the expense of shoot growth. Vegetative Reproduction- Bigcone Douglas-fir does not sprout from the root crown after cutting or fire. It has been propagated by grafting.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- In deep shade, growth of bigcone Douglas-fir seedlings and saplings is suppressed severely. Saplings may be only 60 cm (24 in) tall when 40 to 50 years old (10). Growth rings often are indistinguishable. Bigcone Douglas-fir trees break through the oak overstory when 4 to 9 m (13 to 30 ft) tall and 40 to 70 years old. Breast-height diameter at this age ranges from 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in). Once above the oak foliage and into sunlight, growth of bigcone Douglas-fir accelerates. Annual height increment may exceed 30 cm (12 in). In more open stands, bigcone Douglas-fir seedlings and saplings develop more quickly. Height of saplings may average 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft) at age 20 and from 4 to 15 m (13 to 50 ft) at age 40. From 40 to 100 years, annual increments of height and diameter may be uniform, even though amounts of annual precipitation vary. Trees in favorable growing conditions often produce thick tapering boles and long drooping branches. In the Santa Ana Mountains, diameter growth rates seem to be correlated to steepness of slope, with the average diameter of trees of a given age increasing as the angle of slope decreases. The largest trees of a given age, therefore, grow on level sites. The average d.b.h. of 20-year-old trees on level ground was 20 cm (7.8 in), but only 6 cm (2.2 in) on 60 to 90 degree slopes. A possible explanation of the difference is that little, if any, soil and litter are found on steep slopes, and water holding capacity and nutrients usually are low (1). Tree heights are affected by many variables, especially position on the slope. Trees generally are tallest at the base of slopes and shortest near the ridgeline. Trees at base of slopes commonly are straight and tall, averaging 24 to 30 m (80 to 100 ft) in height, but trees on upper slopes more often are gnarled and branchy and only 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft) tall. The lifespan of bigcone Douglas-fir is as long as its coniferous associates, or longer. In the Santa Ana Mountains, trees 250 or more years old are commonplace. The oldest tree sampled was 622 years old and 140 cm (55 in) in d.b.h. A 157-cm (62-in) d.b.h. monarch of indeterminate age is nearby (1). The largest living bigcone Douglas-fir grows near San Antonio Canyon on the Angeles National Forest in southern California. At 231 cm (91 in) in d.b.h. and 44.2 m (145 ft) in height, this tree deserves its name ""Old Glory."" Bigcone Douglas-fir is well known for its ability to grow a new crown after severe burning. This ability has helped to sustain the species in its present natural range. New tissue, which leads to new branches, develops from the upper surface of defoliated limbs in the upper portions of the tree. Large sawtimber-sized trees, therefore, can develop new crowns, but seedlings, saplings, and overmature sawtimber usually cannot. Boles also produce new shoots after fire, mechanical, or physiological injury. Vigorous intermediate-aged trees are particularly noted for this capability. In the Santa Ana Mountains, new shoots developed in trees that were from 13 to 114 cm (5 to 45 in) in d.b.h. and from 25 to 300 years old (1). Rooting Habit- The species is described as having a strong spreading root system. Reaction to Competition- In its seedling stage, bigcone Douglas-fir requires at least some shade. In moist sheltered situations, however, it reproduces successfully in the open. Saplings and small poles need increasing amounts of light for best development. Mature trees usually are found in open stands, probably as a consequence of having adequate light and moisture. In general, bigcone Douglas-fir may be classed as intolerant of shade. Damaging Agents- Fire is the most injurious agent of bigcone Douglas-fir. In spite of its ability to develop new crowns after complete defoliation, and its thick bark (15 to 20 cm or 6 to 8 in for trees more than 100-cm or 40-in d.b.h.), trees die from fire, and particularly from repeated fires that deplete energy reserves and enlarge old wounds. Damage by insects and disease is not reported. The California flatheaded borer (Melanophila californica) has been observed in the wood of a few trees. Even trees damaged by fire seem free of bark beetle attacks. A hard pitchy wood is given as a possible reason for lack of damage from these agents. A needle-cast fungus (Rhabdocline pseudotsugae) has been observed on bigcone Douglas-fir needles (8). Older trees occasionally lose most of their needles, apparently from a physiological disorder, but epicormic branching along the bole usually replaces the lost crown. Damage to needles from ozone is another potential injury. However, in a sensitivity study, seedlings of bigcone Douglas-fir ranked low (11th of 13 conifer species and hybrids) in susceptibility to ozone injury (9). Many species of animals are associated with bigcone Douglas-fir, especially deer, rabbits, and woodrats. Browsing of seedlings is a major damage. Bigcone Douglas-fir stands are preferred spring habitat for black bears in the San Bernardino Mountains (12). After the sapling stage, animal damage is negligible.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,14,1
"Soils on which bigcone Douglas-fir grows are derived from a wide variety of parent materials. Of 16 stands sampled throughout the range of the species, 4 grew on metasedimentary parent materials (sandstone and schist), 10 on granitics, and 2 in contact zones where the parent material was primarily granitic. The soil orders where bigcone Douglas-fir is most frequently found are Inceptisols and occasionally Alfisols. Soil series on metasedimentary material are probably Laughlin and Friant; in contact zones, Oak Glen; and on granitics, Tollhouse, Cieneba, Crouch, and two others that resemble Tish Tang and Neuns. Soils show a broad range of depth and development (7). Some are shallow and poorly developed; others are deeper and better developed. Many are droughty. Bigcone Douglas-fir is capable of becoming established on soils too dry for other conifers. Topography where the species is found is variable. Much of the terrain is rough and steep, strongly dissected by permanent and ephemeral streams. Slopes vary from 1 to 93 percent. Some stands occupy precipitous slopes of sheltered canyons, others are found on mostly steep broken slopes intermixed with cliffs and avalanche chutes, and still others thrive on gentler slopes and level ground. For all stands in the Santa Ana Mountains, average angle of slope is 34.5 degrees (1). The species is well represented on all aspects, north slopes in particular. Elevations of the bigcone Douglas-fir habitat range from 275 m (900 ft) on cool moist north slopes of canyon bottoms to 2400 m (7,875 ft) on warm southfacing plateaus. As elevations increase, the aspect best suited to bigcone Douglas-fir shifts from cooler to warmer. Many combinations of slope, aspect, soil, and elevation, therefore, support bigcone Douglas-fir.",Soils and Topography,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,15,1
"The wood of bigcone Douglas-fir is heavy, hard, and close grained, but not durable (15). It has less sapwood than heartwood, the latter containing pockets of resin. In the past, bigcone Douglas-fir was used locally for fuel and to a small extent for coarse lumber. Currently, it has value in watersheds and wildlife habitats for its scenic beauty.",Special Uses,Bigcone Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,macrocarpa,conifer,16,1
"Bigtooth aspen is found in pure aspen forest covers either singly or in various combinations with quaking aspen and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). Balsam poplar is a minor component of this combination on the dry-mesic sites and bigtooth aspen is a minor component on the wet-mesic sites (4). The species is a major component of the forest cover type Aspen (Society of American Foresters Type 16) and is a minor component in the following types (8): 1 Jack Pine 5 Balsam Fir 14 Northern Pin Oak 15 Red Pine 17 Pin Cherry 18 Paper Birch 19 Gray Birch-Red Maple 21 Eastern White Pine 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 32 Red Spruce 33 Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 35 Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 37 Northern White-Cedar 43 Bear Oak 46 Eastern Redcedar 60 Beech-Sugar Maple 108 Red Maple In the northern part of its range, common tree associates are quaking aspen, balsam poplar, balsam fir (Abies balsamea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera) gray birch (B. populifolia), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), red pine (P resinosa), red maple (Acer rubrum), and white spruce (Picea glauca).

"Bigtooth aspen spans a range of climatic conditions from the marine climate along the Atlantic coast to the continental climate of Minnesota and southwestern Ontario. Summers are humid and moisture is adequate at all seasons (4,7). Mean annual precipitation ranges from a low of 510 mm (20 in) on the prairie border in Manitoba to a high of 1520 mm. (60 in) in the Maritime Provinces. North to south mean annual precipitation ranges from 510 to 1270 mm (20 to 50 in) with one-half or more occurring during the growing season. Mean annual snowfall exceeds 127 cm (50 in) where bigtooth aspen is most abundant and of best form. Mean annual snowfall exceeds 250 cm (100 in) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Northeast and reaches a maximum of 300 cm (120 in) in Nova Scotia (7). Areas near Lake Superior in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan often receive more than 500 cm (200 in) of snowfall. January temperatures average -18° C (0° F) in the North and 2° C (35° F) in the South. Temperatures of -46° C (- 50° F) have been recorded at the northern limit of bigtooth aspen. Average July temperatures range from 16° C (60° F) in the North to 26° C (78° F) in the South.

"Natural hybrids of bigtooth aspen and quaking aspen do occur, but less frequently than might be expected, because of differences in time of flowering. When hybridization occurs, it is most likely to be between male quaking aspen and female bigtooth aspen (3,4,9). The best known interspecific hybrid is Populus alba x P. grandidentata (P. x rouleauiana Boivin). Growth is superior to native bigtooth aspen on dry, sandy soils, but its development is maximized on fertile, moist loamy soils. Seed production and suckering are generally low and branchiness and form are poor. P. x canescens x P. grandidentata has shown good growth but poor rootability. P. x canescens x P. alba x P. grandidentata has shown both good growth and good rootability. Additional crosses with bigtooth aspen have been made but are generally of lower quality. Intraspecific crosses of bigtooth aspen have been difficult to establish in plantings and have slow early growth. Bigtooth aspen has 19 pairs of chromosomes (2n=38).",Hybrids,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,9,0
"Bigtooth aspen is native to northeastern and north-central United States and southeastern Canada. Its range extends from Cape Breton Island Nova Scotia, west to southeastern Manitoba, south through Minnesota and Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri, and east to southern Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, and Delaware. It is also found locally in western North Carolina and northwestern Tennessee. In Canada, the greatest abundance of bigtooth aspen is in southwestern Quebec and southeastern Ontario (4). -The native range of bigtooth aspen.",Native Range,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,11,0
"Recognizing the inter- and intraspecific clonal variation in aspen stands can lead to definite upgrading of the quality of aspen in growth, form, and disease resistance. In mixed stands of bigtooth aspen and quaking aspen on dry exposed sites, bigtooth aspen clones have superior growth and disease resistance (5,6). The interclonal variation in rootability should be recognized when stands are established from stem and root cuttings.",Population Differences,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Bigtooth aspen is normally dioecious; flowering begins at about age 10. Flowers are borne in drooping catkins, 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 in) long, that are tan-colored at maturity. Bracts have 5 to 7 clefts and capsules are narrow and cone-shaped. Flowering precedes foliation and seed is dispersed before leaves are fully expanded. Female receptivity tends to begin before male pollen shed and lasts longer, but the mean dates of peak receptivity and pollen shed are closely allied. The timing of receptivity or pollen shed varies little intraclonally but varies significantly interclonally, The duration of active flowering is shorter for bigtooth aspen than for quaking aspen (3,4,7,9). Air temperature seems to be the principal factor affecting the time and duration of flowering. In southern Ontario flowering occurs in late April; in southeastern lower Michigan flowering time is late April to early May; and in northern lower Michigan and northern Minnesota flowers appear in early to mid-May. Dehiscence of the capsule and seed dispersal take place about 4 weeks after flowering. Bigtooth aspen flowers, foliates, and disperses seeds about 10 days later than quaking aspen (3,4,7). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are pear-shaped, with a tuft of long silky hair attached to the narrow end. Good seed crops are produced every 2 or 3 years, but light seed crops are produced annually. Seeds are very light averaging approximately 5.6 million/kg (2.54 million/lb) with hair and are dispersed by wind for long distances from the parent tree (4). A single tree may produce more than 1.5 million seeds (3). Seedling Development- Seedlings do not commonly occur in nature, in spite of extremely high production and high seed viability (more than 80 percent germination under laboratory conditions) (3,4). The uncommon occurrence has various causes: competition from other plants, short seed viability (2 or 3 weeks), the presence of a germination and growth inhibitor in the seed hairs, lack of moisture, high seedbed temperatures, susceptibility to fungal attack, and the chemical nature of some soils. Germination is epigeal. Bare, moist soil is essentially for seed germination and seedling establishment. If ground moisture is adequate, seeds usually germinate in 1 to 2 days. When the seed coat is ready to rupture, a typical time table for seedling development is as follows (4): 24 h Radical emerges from seed and contacts soil; fine hairs develop at junction of radical and hypocotyl. 48 h Hypocotyl elongates and raises cotyledons above ground. 144 h Cotyledons expand and shed testa; radical penetrates soil about 10 mm (0.4 in). 1 yr Seedling is 15 to 20 em (6 to 8 in) tall; root spread is about 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) deep and as much as 40 em (16 in) wide. 2 yr Seedling is 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 in) tall. 3 yr Seedling is 90 to 120 cm (36 to 48 in) tall. Abundant moisture can greatly increase the first year's height growth, but competition from brush and weeds can easily eliminate 1-year-old seedlings. Vegetative Reproduction- Suckering is the most common mode of reproduction. Suckers usually develop from shallow, cordlike lateral roots. These roots range from 0.5 to 11.4 cm. (0.2 to 4.5 in) in diameter with the greatest proportion of suckers on roots less than 2.5 cm (1.0 in) in diameter. Sucker-bearing roots lie about 7.5 cm (3.0 in) deep in the mineral soil but can be as deep as 17.8 cm. (7.0 in) (4). Sucker-bearing roots tend to be deeper for bigtooth aspen than for quaking aspen. Sprouts from stump and root collar are rare but develop more frequently in bigtooth than quaking aspen (9). Sucker initiation is attributed to an increase in soil temperature and relief from the apical dominance effect (3,4). Almost any disturbance-tree cutting, brush removal, fire, or ground scarification-can result in some degree of suckering (2,3,5). Existing stands continually produce suckers but most of them are weak and die within a few years (4,7). Vegetative reproduction results in the formation of male and female clones that range from a few to several trees and occupy from 0.004 to 1.5 ha (0.01 to 3.8 acres) (3,4). Suckering ability varies significantly interclonally but no relation exists between size of clone and suckering ability. A single clone tends to exclude the invasion of other clones on a particular area, but the intermixing of ""clone territories"" to form a stand is common. In mixed stands of bigtooth aspen clones and quaking aspen clones, the clonal boundaries between the two species are well defined; the clonal boundaries within species are less distinct (1,3,4,9). After a stand is logged or killed by fire, suckering normally produces from 8,000 to 60,000 stems per hectare (3,200 to 24,000/acre). Age of parent stand, residual overstory, season of cutting, intensity of fire, and amount of ground scarification affect the abundance and vigor of suckers (3,4,5,9). Suckers have been produced more than 30 in (100 ft) from the parent tree when invading open fields (2), but 10 m (33 ft) is a more likely maximum within a stand (6). Because of the existing root system, suckers grow faster than seedlings and often reach 0.9 to 1.8 in (3 to 6 ft) in height the first year. Reproducing bigtooth aspen from stem cuttings is difficult. However, rootability can be improved if the cuttings have expanding foliar buds or are treated with indolebutyric acid (4,7). Root cuttings have a good capacity to produce suckers. Interclonal variation in rootability of cutting is large.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Normally, mature bigtooth aspen trees are 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) tall and 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) in d.b.h. On the best sites, bigtooth aspen can attain a height of 30 in (100 ft) at 50 to 60 years of age (3,4,5). Height growth is rapid for the first 30 years and slows markedly thereafter. Quaking aspen tends to have slower height growth initially but maintains this growth longer. Stand basal area seldom exceeds 34.4 m²/ha (150 ft²/acre). Empirical yields for 50-year-old bigtooth aspen in northern lower Michigan range from 100.8 m³/ha (1,440 ft³/acre) on site index 15 in (50 ft) sites to 296.8 m³/ha (4,240 ft³/acre) on site index 24 m (80 ft) sites (table 1) (5). For bigtooth aspen, site index is determined at base age 50 years. Stands begin to deteriorate from rot fungi at 40 to 45 years of age on the poor sites and at 50 to 70 years of age on the better sites. Large single cull trees more than 100 years old are found. Bigtooth aspen appears to be more resistant to disease than quaking aspen. Rooting Habit- Suckers remain connected to parent roots even after they develop their own root system. Adventitious roots develop at the basal part of the sucker or on the parent root near the sucker base. Cordlike root connections between the sucker and parent root remain alive until one of the two trees dies (4). Bigtooth aspen's root system is shallow and wide spreading. Strong, vertical, and penetrating roots near the base of the tree, and sinker roots developing from the lateral roots, provide good anchorage. Four to five well-developed lateral roots originate from the base of the tree and branch within 0.6 in (2 ft). The lateral spread of roots is usually 10 to 20 in (33 to 66 ft) under forested conditions. Bigtooth aspen's root system tends to be deeper, to be less branched, and to have fewer adventitious roots than quaking aspen's root system (4,9). Reaction to Competition- Bigtooth aspen is classed as very intolerant of shade. It cannot successfully reproduce under its own shade (3,7), and seedlings must be kept free of competing brush and grasses. However, sucker growth is rapid enough to outgrow its competition. Leaving as little as 5.7 to 8.0 m²/ha (25 to 35 ft²/acre) basal area in the residual overstory can severely limit sucker initiation and growth. Severing all stems 5.0 cm (2.0 in) and larger is recommended for producing well-stocked vigorous sucker stands (5). Mortality is very high in young sucker stands, but this acts as a natural thinning agent. Trees begin to express dominance at 7 to 10 years, and potential crop trees can often be identified by age 10. Trees die throughout the life of the stand until 620 to 1,235 stems per hectare (250 to 500/acre) remain at the end of the rotation. Bigtooth aspen responds well to thinning for producing small saw-log and veneer material. Only well-formed, disease-resistant clones on site index 21 in (70 ft) or better areas should be considered for producing sawtimber and veneer (5). Clearcutting is the best method for harvesting stands because the completeness of the overstory removal determines the establishment and vigor of the new stand. Rotation lengths are 30 to 40 years on the poorest sites, and 50 to 60 years on the best sites because stands deteriorate rapidly when held to greater ages. With proper harvesting and site preparation bigtooth aspen can continually occupy a site. Otherwise, it will be succeeded by the more shade-tolerant hardwood and coniferous species (3). Damaging Agents- Bigtooth aspen is subject to a number of agents that cause damage and mortality. Fire can easily kill these thin-barked trees or reduce their growth and provide entry points for disease organisms. Hailstorms may defoliate trees and severely scar stems and provide similar entry points. Heavy thinning may subject the residual stems to sunscalding. Windthrow is not a problem but wind breakage is common at cankered and borer-infested portions of the stem. Hypoxylon canker (Hypoxylon mammatum) is the most serious disease of the aspens. Trees often are girdled or subjected to wind breakage, but bigtooth aspen is much more resistant to Hypoxylon canker than quaking aspen. Heart rot (Phellinus tremulae) can cause serious volume loss and stand deterioration when stands are held beyond rotation age. Ganoderma applanatum and Armillaria mellea can cause extensive root decay. Shepherd's crook (Venturia macularis) may repeatedly kill new terminal growth in young stands (2,4,7,9). Clones vary greatly in resistance to disease attack and damage. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and the large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) have periodically defoliated extensive areas of aspen. Populations of these insects usually persist for 2 or 3 years and then suddenly collapse. Growth loss can be substantial but few trees are killed (2,4,7,9). The poplar borer (Saperda calcarata) is the most serious wood borer in aspen. Extensive boring degrades large trees and subjects stems to wind breakage. Wood borers of several species can provide infection points for Hypoxylon canker and other fungi. In turn, defoliating insects may cause an increase in populations of wood borers (2,4,7,9). When their populations are high, deer and hare can heavily browse young stands. This is seldom a problem in dense stands, however, because browsing helps thin these stands. Beaver can kill large portions of stands both by flooding and by cutting trees (2,5,9).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,14,0
"Bigtooth aspen is capable of growing on a wide range of sites but is far less adaptable than quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). It is most abundant on sands, loamy sands, and light sandy loams, but it is found as a single tree or minor stand component on any soil, from rock outcrops to heavy clays. Bigtooth aspen develops best on moist, fertile sandy uplands where the depth to water table is no more than 1.5 m (5 ft), and site quality decreases rapidly as the depth to water table approaches 0.6 rn (2 ft). Within this zone, a stagnant water table is much more detrimental than the lateral movement of water. Stands generally are unmerchantable if located on soils with an impermeable stratum at 0.3 rn (I ft) or less or a permeable subsoil that is dry to 1.5 m (5 ft) in the summer. Good soil aeration is essential for good growth of bigtooth aspen (3,4,5,7). Soils on which bigtooth aspen most commonly grow are in the orders Spodosols, Alfisols, and Inceptisols. Although bigtooth aspen can grow at sea level and has been found at altitudes over 915 m (3,000 ft) in North Carolina, it is most abundant and develops best on flat to gently rolling terrain of floodplains or lower slopes of the uplands between 150 to 610 m (500 to 2,000 ft) in altitude.",Soils and Topography,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,15,0
"Typical management of aspen stands does not distinguish between bigtooth aspen and quaking aspen, and their uses are not differentiated. The aspen forests contribute significantly to maintaining other resources. It is no accident that the native range of ruffed grouse coincides with the native range of the aspens. Aspen leaves and staminate flower buds provide ruffed grouse with their most important yearlong food resource. Aspen suckers are a favored winter food of moose and are heavily browsed by white-tailed deer. Although aspen is not the most palatable browse, an abundance and wide distribution of small clearcuttings are essential for maintaining a good deer population. The bark, leaves, twigs, and branches of aspen are preferred by beaver (2,9). Because aspen is deciduous, more snow accumulates on the ground in aspen than in coniferous stands. Thus, soils are better insulated from freezing and snowmelt enters the soil rather than running overland. Because of aspen's ability to produce abundant suckers, fire-killed stands are rapidly revegetated. Similarly, aspen can be harvested on slopes without seriously affecting erosion or water quality. Aspen often is perpetuated on areas where soil stabilization poses a problem (2). Aspen bark has been pelletized for supplemental cattle feed and fuel. Although the vast quantity of these pellets comes from quaking aspens bark, no distinction has been made between bigtooth aspen and quaking aspen in the pelletizing process.",Special Uses,Bigtooth Aspen,populus,grandidentata,hardwood,16,0
"To date, no information has been published concerning population or other genetic studies of this species. Hickories are well-known for their variability and many natural hybrids among North American species are known. Usually the species within each genus can be successfully intercrossed (14). Bitternut hickory naturally hybridizes with the following species: C. illinoensis (C. x brownii Sarg.), C. glabra (C.

"Bitternut hickory is probably the most abundant and most uniformly distributed of all the hickories. It grows throughout the eastern United States from southwestern New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec; west to southern Ontario, central Michigan, and northern Minnesota; south to eastern Texas; and east to northwestern Florida and Georgia. It is most common, however, from southern New England west to Iowa and from southern Michigan south to Kentucky (6,23,26). -The native range of bitternut hickory. Throughout the range of bitternut hickory, the mean annual precipitation ranges from 640 to 1270 mm (25 to 50 in) except for a small area in the southern Appalachians where about 2030 mm. (80 in) is common. In the northern part of the range, snowfall averages 203 cm (80 in) per year, but in the southern extreme of the range, it rarely snows. During the growing season, from April to September, the precipitation ranges from 510 to 1020 mm (20 to 40 in). Annual temperatures range from about 4° to 18° C (40° to 65° F), July temperatures from about 18° to 27° C (65° to 80° F), and January temperatures from -15° to 12° C (5° to 54° F). Extremes of 46° to -40° C (115° to -40° F) have occurred within the range. Bitternut seldom grows in areas where the growing season is less than 120 or more than 240 days long (30,34). Bitternut hickory grows in moist mountain valleys along streambanks and in swamps. Although it is usually found on wet bottom lands, it grows on dry sites and also grows well on poor soils low in nutrients (10). In the northern part of its range, bitternut hickory is found on a variety of sites. It grows on rich, loamy, gravelly soil in low wet woods, and along the borders of streams in Michigan, but it is also found on dry uplands. In the southern part of its range, bitternut is more restricted to moist sites. It reaches its largest size on the rich bottom lands of the lower Ohio River Basin. In the southeastern part of its range, bitternut grows on overflow bottom land, but in its southwestern range, it is common on poor, dry, gravelly upland soils. Bitternut is not found in the mountain forests of northern New England and New York, nor at higher elevations in the Appalachians (23). Bitternut hickory grows primarily on Ultisols that occupy about 50 percent of its geographic range (33). These soils are low in nutrients and are found primarily in the southern to mid-Atlantic region on gentle to steep slopes. Along the mid-Atlantic, southern, and western ranges, bitternut hickory grows on a variety of soils on slopes of 25 percent or less, including combinations of fine to coarse loams and well-drained quartz sands. On slopes steeper than 25 percent, bitternut hickory grows on coarse loams. Inceptisols occupy about 15 percent of the bitternut hickory range, dominating the Appalachian portion of the geographic range. On gently to moderately sloped topography, the hickories are found on fine loams with a fragipan. On steep slopes, they are more commonly found on coarse loams. These soils are moderate to high in nutrients and water is available to plants during more than half of the year or more than 3 consecutive months during the warm season. Mollisols occupy an estimated 20 percent of the bitternut hickory range primarily in western areas (33). These soils typically have a dark, deep, fertile surface horizon more than 25 cm (10 in) thick. Mollisols form under grass in climates that have moderate seasonal precipitation. Bitternut grows on a variety of soil combinations such as wet, fine loams, and sandy-textured soils that often have been burned, plowed, and pastured. Alfisols comprise about 15 percent of the bitternut range, mainly in northern and northwestern portions. These soils contain a medium to high supply of nutrients. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, bitternut hickory is found on moist, well-drained, sandy soils with slopes up to 25 percent. Near Lake Erie and in southern Illinois and northeastern Missouri, it occasionally occurs on wet to moist, poorly drained soils on slopes of less than 10 percent. Bitternut hickory, though present throughout the eastern forest, does not grow in sufficient numbers to be included as a titled species in the Society of American Foresters forest cover types (8), but it is mentioned as an associated species in six types. With one exception, most of these types are subclimax to climax. In the northern forest region, the types are Sugar Maple-Basswood (Society of American Foresters Type 26) and Sugar Maple (Type 27); in the central forest region, White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52) and White Oak (Type 53); in the southern forest region, Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80) and Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91). Hickories are mentioned, but not individually identified, in 16 other cover types; however, 5 of these mentioned types are subclimax to climax. Because bitternut hickory occupies many sites throughout its geographic range, its associations vary. In addition to the species named in the cover types, bitternut hickory grows with various oaks (Quercus spp.) in the northern region. In the southern part of Quebec, there is a sugar maple-bitternut hickory subtype that is restricted to deep soils. Trees associated with it include basswood (Tilia spp.), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), butternut (Juglans cinerea), and black maple (Acer nigrum). In the central hardwood region, extending in to northwestern Minnesota, bitternut hickory is found with hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and butternut. Common understory herbaceous stems include largeflower bellwort (Uvularia grandiflora), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), hepatica (Hepatica acutiloba), wood-nettle (Laportea canadensis), wild ginger (Asarum canadense), large flowering trillium (Trillium grandiflorum), springbeauty (Claytonia caroliniana), violets (Viola spp.), anemone (Anemone spp.), Solomons-seal (Polygonatum pubescens), and false Solomons-seal (Smilacina stellata). In upland oak types of the central forest region, bitternut hickory is commonly associated with mockernut hickory (C. tomentosa), pignut hickory (C. glabra), and shagbark hickory (C. ovata). Other common associates are yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), white ash (Fraxinus americana), green ash, maples, elms (Ulmus spp.), pines (Pinus spp.), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Important understory trees and shrubs associated with bitternut include dogwood (Cornus spp.), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), downy serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea), redbud (Cercis canadensis), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), sumac (Rhus spp.), viburnums (Viburnum spp.), rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum), wild grape (Vitis spp.), greenbriers (Smilax spp.), Virginia creeper, and poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Bitternut hickory is also prominent in the southern bottom-land hardwood swamps, in the cover type Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak. There it is found with shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), shagbark and mockernut hickories, green and white ash, white oak (Quercus alba), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), Delta post oak (Q. stellata var. paludosa), and blackgum. Understory vegetation in this area includes pawpaw (Asimina triloba), American hornbeam, flowering dogwood, painted buckeye (Aesculus sylvatica), devils -walkingstick (Aralia spinosa), redbud, American holly (Ilex opaca), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), southern arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), and possumhaw (Ilex decidua). In the southern pine forest region, bitternut hickory is found primarily as an understory species on dry open sites where shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) predominates along with blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), post oak, mockernut hickory, pignut hickory, and flowering dogwood. Vines, herbaceous vegetation, and shrubs are sparse. The most common understory vegetation includes hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), blueberry (Vaccinum spp.), sumacs, longleaf uniola (Uniola sessiflora), panicums (Panicum spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), and bluestems (Andropogon spp.).",Habitat,Bitternut Hickory,carya,cordiformis,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Bitternut hickory is monoecious; male and female flowers are produced on the same tree. The male flowers are in catkins about 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and are produced on branches from axils of leaves of the previous season or from the inner scales of the terminal bud at the base of the current growth. Female flowers are about 13 mm (0.5 in) long and appear in short spikes on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year (3). Depending on latitude and weather, greenish flowers bloom in the spring from April to May. Usually the male flowers emerge before the female flowers. Hickories produce very large amounts of pollen that are carried by the wind. Ripe fruits are about 25 to 40 mm (1.0 to 1.5 in) long, and solitary or in clusters of two or three; they are subglobose with a yellowish-green, often minutely scurfy, thin husk that is four-winged above the middle. Fruits are slightly flattened. The fruit ripens from September to October and contains bitter-tasting kernels. The drupelike nuts are subglobose, light reddish brown to gray-brown, thin-shelled, two-lobed, and abruptly pointed into a conical head (10,11,17,21). Seed Production and Dissemination- Bitternut hickory seeds are dispersed from September through December. This species does not produce seeds abundantly until the tree is approximately 30 years old. Optimum production extends from 50 to 125 years; trees that are more than 175 years old seldom produce good seed crops (3). Good seed crops occur at 3- to 5-year intervals, with light crops in the intervening years. Bitternut hickory seed is estimated to be from 70 to 85 percent viable (28). Germination requires 90 to 120 days. Seeds for all species seldom remain viable when they are in the ground for more than 1 year. Clean bitternut seeds may range from 275 to 410/kg (125 to 185/lb) (3). Seed dissemination is almost entirely by gravity; the fruit is thought to be generally distasteful to wildlife (35). Since bitternut grows in wet bottom land, floodwater probably influences its seeding range. Seedling Development- Embryo dormancy in hickory seed can be overcome by stratification in a moist medium at 0.6° to 4.4° C (33° to 40° F) for 30 to 150 days; when stored for a year or more, seed may require only 30 to 60 days' stratification. Bitternut seeds can probably tolerate a more moist seedbed than most of the other hickories, and it is the least susceptible to frost. Germination is hypogeal. On red clay soil in the Ohio Valley under open or lightly shaded conditions, bitternut hickory seedlings measured 34 cm (13.3 in) in height at 4 years. Sprouts of 1-year-old bitternut seedlings grown on red clay averaged 28 cm (11 in) (23). Vegetative Reproduction- Stump and root sprouting are common among pecan hickories. Bitternut hickory is the most prolific root and stump sprouter of the northern species of hickory, with sprouts arising from stumps, root collar, and roots. Most sprouts from saplings and pole-size trees are at the root collar, and sprouts from sawtimber-size trees are root suckers. Stump sprouts are usually less numerous than root collar sprouts or root suckers (9,23). Bitternut hickory develops a dense root system and can be transplanted more successfully than other hickories. For this reason, it may have promise as root stock for grafting and budding; however, propagation is usually by seed, with best results in early spring (10,13,20). Techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood have been described (19).",Life History,Bitternut Hickory,carya,cordiformis,hardwood,10,0
"Growth and Yield-Bitternut hickory typically attains a height of about 30 m (100 ft) and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. The tree attains its best height growth in the rich bottom lands of the lower Ohio River Basin (7). Its life span is about 200 years. Second-growth bitternut hickory on a good site in the Ohio Valley reached the following average heights and diameters (23): Growth rates (d.b.h.) of hickory species have been compared to other species in Appalachian hardwood stands as follows (29): dominant-codominant hickories 38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 in) in d.b.h. in well-stocked stands on good oak sites grew slower than northern red oak, yellow-poplar, black cherry (Prunus serotina), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Hickories grew about the same as chestnut oak Quercus prinus), white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Diameter growth for hickory was about 0.3 cm (0.12 in) per year; it was about 0.5 cm (0.20 in) for black cherry and about 0.6 cm (0.23 in) for yellow-poplar and red oak. Equations are available for predicting merchantable gross volumes from hickory stump diameters in Ohio (12). Also, procedures are described for predicting diameters and heights and for developing volume tables to any merchantable top diameter for hickory species in southern Illinois and West Virginia (22,37). Bitternut hickory generally prunes itself more readily than other hickories. Epicormic branching is not a problem with hickory species, but occasionally a few branches do occur (27,29). In bitternut hickory, the ratio of sapwood to heartwood is low; sapwood seldom is more than 38 mm (1.5 in) wide or more than 25 years old (23). Bitternut hickory is the hardiest of the hickories (26), as indicated by its wide geographic range. Rooting Habit- Bitternut hickory develops a dense root system with a pronounced taproot. It is windfirm and can be transplanted more successfully than any other hickory species (20). Early root growth is primarily into the taproot, which typically reaches a depth of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) during the first year (32). Small laterals originate throughout the length of the taproot but may die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of 122 ern (48 in) and the laterals grow rapidly. After about 5 years or so, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the branches. By age 10, the height of the top is about four times the depth of the taproot while the spread of the crown branches is only about half that of the root system. Mature pecan hickory root systems have a deep taproot, with lateral roots emerging at nearly right angles to the taproot, but no major lateral roots. Pecan hickory roots begin to develop just before spring shoot growth. Roots are more responsive to favorable conditions of soil or climate, and conversely more sensitive to adverse conditions. Depending on environmental conditions, there are usually four to eight cycles of root growth during the year (32). Reaction to Competition- Bitternut hickory is considered intolerant of shade but seems to have a higher seedling tolerance on bottom lands than most of its associates (24). Hickories also can be intermediate in tolerance (23,29). Bitternut is less susceptible to frost damage than other hickories (24). Silvicultural practices for managing the oak-hickory type are summarized by Watt et al. (36). Establishing hickory trees from seedlings is difficult because of seed predators. Infrequent bumper seed crops usually provide some seedlings, but seedling survival is poor under a dense canopy. Because of its prolific sprouting ability, hickory reproduction can survive browsing, breakage, drought, and fire. Top dieback and resprouting may occur frequently, with each successive shoot attaining a larger size and developing a stronger root system than its predecessors (16). By this process, hickory reproduction gradually accumulates and develops under moderately dense canopies, especially on sites dry enough to restrict reproduction of more tolerant, but more fire- or drought-sensitive species. Wherever hickory advance reproduction is adequate, clearcutting results in fast-growing sapling stands of hickories. If there is no advance hickory reproduction, clearcutting eliminates hickories except for stump sprouts. Theory suggests that light thinnings or shelterwood cuts can be used to create advance hickory regeneration, but this has not been demonstrated. Damaging Agents- Bitternut hickory saplings are easily damaged by fire, and older trees also are susceptible to fire damage because of the low insulating capacity of the hard bark (13,24). It is not affected by severe diseases but has many of the problems common to most hickories; these include mineral streaks and sapsucker-induced streaks that degrade lumber. White heart rot (Poria spiculosa) is the most widespread and damaging disease of hickory. This trunk rot can produce extensive decay from wounds. A common white wood rot (Phellinus igniarius) also attacks bitternut hickory through fire wounds. Occasionally Nectria (Nectria galligena) and Strumella (Strumella coryneoidea) produce cankers on the stems of bitternut hickory, but most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small young trees. In general, the hard, strong, durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi (2,10,13). Foliage diseases such as leaf mildew, witches' broom (Microstroma juglandis), and leaf blotch (Mycosphaerella dendroides) occur on all hickory species. Pecan scab (Cladosporium effusum) also occurs on foliage, and bitternut hickory is a host to anthracnose (Gnomonia caryae). Nuts of all hickory species are susceptible to attack by the hickory nut weevil (Curculio caryae). Another weevil (Conotrachelus aratus) attacks young shoots and leaf petioles. The Curculio species are the most damaging, often destroying 65 percent of the hickory nut crop (1). The most important bark beetle attacking bitternut hickory is the hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus). Attacks by this insect are more serious during drought years and where hickory species are growing rapidly, The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) often seriously deforms trees by severing branches, and sometimes these girdlers even cut hickory seedlings near ground level (1). Two casebearers (Acrobasis caryivorella and A juglandis) feed on buds and leaves and later bore into succulent hickory shoots. Larvae of A. caryivorella may destroy entire nut sets. The living-hickory borer (Goes pulcher) feeds on hickory boles and branches throughout the East. Borers that commonly feed on dying or dead hickories and logs include the banded hickory borer (Knulliana cincta), a long-horned beetle (Saperda discoidea), apple twig borer (Amphicerus bicaudatus), the flatheaded ambrosia beetle (Platypus compositus), redheaded ash borer (Neoclytus acuminatus), and a false powderpost beetle (Scobicia bidentata). Insects that severely damage lumber and manufactured hickory products include the powderpost beetles (Lyctus spp.) and Polycanon stoutii. Gall insects (Caryomyia spp.) commonly infest leaves. The fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospila) and the hickory leafroller (Argyrotaenia juglandana) are the most common leaf feeders. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae feed on hickory leaves, but hickories are not the gypsy moth's favorite food. The giant bark aphid (Longistigma caryae) is common on the bark of hickories. This aphid feeds on twigs and can cause branch mortality. European fruit lecanium (Parthenolecanium corni) is common in hickories (1). Some birds and mammals eat the nuts when there are less favored hickory nuts available. Together with losses from insects and disease, these virtually eliminate the annual nut production except during bumper seed crop years.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Bitternut Hickory,carya,cordiformis,hardwood,14,0
"Bitternut is used for lumber and pulpwood. Pecan. hickories, such as bitternut, are not equal to true hickories in strength, hardness, and toughness. Based on ovendry weight and green volume, the specific gravity of green bitternut wood is 0.60; at 12 percent moisture content, the specific gravity is 0.66 (31). Hickory species are most desirable for charcoal and fuelwood; pecan hickories are less desirable than the ~rue hickories. Bitternut hickory ranks third in heating value among hickories (25); it burns with ~m intense flame and leaves little ash. Because bitternut hickory wood is hard and durable, it is used for furniture, paneling, dowels, too] handles, and ladders. It is a choice fuel for smoking meats (15). Other uses include bars, crates', pallets, and flooring (10). Bitternut hickory seeds are eaten by wildlife but are of little value for human consumption because of their high tannin content, and extreme bitterness and astringency (7,18,26,35). Seeds do not usually constitute a large portion of the diet of squirrels. Rabbits, beavers, and small rodents and mammals occasionally feed on the bark of hickory species (5,35). The foliage of bitternut, hickory has a high calcium content and is near the top of the list of soil-improving species (4). Early settlers used oil extracted from the nuts for oil lamps. They also believed the oil was valuable as a cure for rheumatism (19). Bitternut hickory is desirable as an ornamental or shade tree, and the dense root system provides good soil stability.",Special Uses,Bitternut Hickory,carya,cordiformis,hardwood,16,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Black ash is polygamous; its flowers are small and inconspicuous. They appear in May or June at about the same time as, or just before, the leaves. The fruit is an elongated, winged, single-seeded samara that is borne in terminal or axillary clusters. It ripens from June to September (12). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are dispersed from July to October. A 25-year seed crop survey of 19 tree species in northeastern Wisconsin showed that black ash produced good seed crops 28 percent of the years, medium seed crops 4 percent of the years, and poor seed crops 68 percent of the years. Of the 19 northern forest tree species investigated, black ash registered the longest period of poor seed crop, 7 years (7,12). Among the ashes, black ash is about average in seed production. Seeds average between 27.7 and 36.3 kg/45.4 kg of fruit (61 and 80 lb 100/lb). When cleaned, there are 13,500 to 20,900 seeds per kilogram (6,100 to 9,500 lb) or an average of 17,900 kg (8,100 lb) (12). Black ash seeds show dormancy because they have immature embryos, respiratory enzymes in the endosperm, and impermeable seedcoats. Dormancy can be overcome with moist stratification in sand for 2 to 3 months at room temperatures (20° C or 68° F) followed by stratification for 3 months at a temperature slightly above freezing (5° C or 41° F). The embryos mature and seedcoats become permeable during warm stratification and inhibitors disappear during cold stratification (12,13). Seedling Development- Because of dormancy, black ash seed does not normally germinate under natural conditions until the second year. In the nursery, ash seeds may be planted in the fall soon after they are collected and then mulched with burlap or straw until spring, and covered with 6 to 20 mm (0.25 to 0.75 in) of soil. Standard practice is to broadcast or drill seeds to achieve a nursery bed density of about 110 to 160 seedlings per square meter (10 to 15 ft). Germination is epigeal and usually occurs during the second year. Seedlings usually are outplanted as 1-0 stock, sometimes 2-0 in North America (12). Black ash seeds may remain viable for 8 years or more under natural conditions. In natural stands, black ash seedlings commonly grow more slowly than do those of associated species such as American elm (Ulmus americana) and red maple (Acer rubrum). Young black ash sprout readily from stumps.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Ash,fraxinus,nigra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield-Black ash is a small tree. The largest one on record is growing in Bath, OH, and is 26.5 in (87 ft) tall and 148 cm (58.3 in) in d.b.h., with a crown spread of 18.3 in (60 ft) (10). More commonly, the largest trees reach a height of 18 to 21 in (60 to 70 ft) and a diameter of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in). In many forests, the largest trees are only 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) in d.b.h. As would be expected of a species that grows in areas with a high water table, black ash has a relatively slow growth rate. Site index at base age 50 years ranges from 15 to 24 in (50 to 80 ft) in northern Wisconsin and Michigan (2). Forest survey data from 20 counties in northern Minnesota indicate that black ash is only about 80 percent as tall at age 50 as is balsam fir (Abies balsamea) on the same site (3). In many Michigan bogs, black ash-red maple stands grow only 9 to 11 in (30 to 35 ft) tall before they are replaced by northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis) (6). In a Minnesota study (11), freshly fallen black ash leaves were found to contain larger amounts of calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, and ash than other hardwoods. The phosphorus content of the foliage was similar to that of most other hardwoods. Rooting Habit- Black ash has a shallow and fibrous root system (8), particularly well adapted to growth under conditions of high soil moisture. Reaction to Competition- Black ash is classed as intolerant of shade (8). Damaging Agents- A study based on an extensive survey of defects in Ontario forest trees concluded that black ash is the most defective of eight deciduous species. The fungi most frequently associated with trunk rot and butt rot of black ash were Stereum murrayi and Armillarea mellea, respectively (1). The oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes u1mi) occasionally kills reproduction and older trees. Leaf spot (Mycosphaerella effigurata), anthracnose (Gloeosporium aridum), rust (Puccinia peridermiospora), and canker (Nectria galligena) cause damage to black ash similar to that reported for white ash (Fraxinus americana). The spongy white (heartwood) rot caused by Polyporus hispidus enters through wounds and is usually found in the upper tree trunk. It is occasionally a serious problem; in one Minnesota stand, it caused degrade of lumber in 5 percent of the trees (14). Deer browse heavily on young black ash and if poplars are scarce, beaver will cut down ash between 25 and 51 cm (10 to 20 in) in stump diameter.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Ash,fraxinus,nigra,hardwood,14,0
"Black ash typically grows in bogs, along streams, or in poorly drained areas that often are seasonally flooded. It is most common on peat and muck soils but also grows on fine sands underlain by sandy till or on sands and loams underlain by lake-washed clayey till (5,9). Although this species can tolerate semistagnant conditions, for best growth it is important that the water be moving so the soil will be aerated even though saturated. Soils suitable for black ash are common in Canada and the northern States. In Indiana, such soils are most common in glaciated areas and in the White River Valley (4) but in Pennsylvania, they most frequently occur south of the glaciated areas. These soils are most commonly found in the orders Histosols and Entisols. Black ash is tolerant of a wide range of pH conditions, from 4.4 to 8.2 (7). In the northern part of its range, black ash is found from sea level to the highest elevations. In the southern part of its range, however, it grows only above 610 m (2,000 ft) in elevation.",Soils and Topography,Black Ash,fraxinus,nigra,hardwood,15,0
"Throughout the eastern United States, black cherry is a component of many forest cover types (18). It is primarily a northern hardwood species, occurring as a common associate in most cover types of this group.

"Provenance testing of black cherry has identified several traits that are related to geographic origin. Seed weight seems to exhibit a definite clinal pattern, increasing as latitude increases (11,60,62). The largest seeds are found among the northern sources (especially those from Wisconsin); seed weight generally decreases to the south and east (60). For example, weight of northwestern Pennsylvania seeds is consistently lower than that of West Virginia seeds (62). Elevation also affects seed weight, with heavier seeds coming from the higher elevations (19). Differences in stem form, branching habit, and incidence of black knot infection of seedlings have also been observed among seed sources (10). Growth and survival of cherry seedlings are likewise affected by seed source (4,11,76). Seedlings from southern sources and lower elevations break dormancy sooner and suffer more severe frost damage than seedlings from northern sources and higher elevations when planted in the North or at higher elevations. Conversely, growth is better from southern sources and lower elevations. An interesting exception seems to be cherry from the heart of the commercial range in northwestern Pennsylvania that outgrew local sources when outplanted in West Virginia during the first 10 years of the USDA Forest Service's tree improvement program. There is also great variation within sources. Large variation in growth of seedlings within half-sib families is common (70), and open pollinated superior trees have not produced significantly better progeny than average trees (61). Considerable variations also exist in such attributes as tendency to produce epicormic sprouts when drastically exposed, and time of leaf senescence in the autumn.",Population Differences,Black Cherry,prunus,serotina,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Unlike domestic cherries, which flower before the leaves appear, black cherry flowers late in relation to leaf development. At the latitude of 41° to 42° N. in Pennsylvania and New York, black cherry flowers usually appear around May 15 to May 20. At that time, the leaves are nearly full-grown though still reddish in color (36). Flower development in other parts of the range varies with climate-from the end of March in Texas to the first week of June in Quebec, Canada. Black cherry flowers are white, solitary, and borne in umbel-like racemes. The flowers are perfect and are insect pollinated (22). Several species of flies, a flower beetle, and several species of bees, including the honey bee, work the blossoms for pollen and nectar. Self-pollination has been observed, but none of the self-pollinated flowers developed into viable seeds (21). Late spring frosts may damage the flowers before they open, and frosts occasionally cause large numbers of newly set fruits to fall from the pedicels without maturing (36). Premature dropping of green fruits is also a problem in some years. The fruit is a one-seeded drupe about 10 min (0.38 in) in diameter with a bony stone or pit. The fruit is black when ripe. Seed Production and Dissemination- Limited flowering of black cherry seedlings in a seed orchard has been observed a few years after planting (5). Viable seeds have been produced on open-grown seedlings or sprouts as young as 10 years of age and on trees as old as 180 years. However, the period of maximum seed production in natural stands is generally between 30 and 100 years of age (36). Some individual trees never produce significant quantities of seed even when they reach an age and crown position where it is expected. In most stands of seed-bearing age, some seeds are produced nearly every year. Good crops occur at intervals of 1 to 5 years across the geographic range of black cherry; on the Alleghany Plateau of northwestern Pennsylvania, good crops have occurred about every other year (7,23). On the Allegheny Plateau, fruit ripening and seedfall occur between August 15 and mid-September; the time is earlier in the southern range and later in the northern range. In the southeastern United States, fruits ripen in late June and seedfall is complete by early July. There may be as much as 3 weeks difference in fruit maturation dates between trees growing in the same stand. Cleaned black cherry seeds range from 6,800 to 17,900/kg (3,100 to 8,100/lb), averaging 10,600/kg (4,800/lb). Seed weight varies geographically, with larger seeds in the northwest range and smaller seeds in the south and east. The bulk of the seed crop falls to the ground in the vicinity of the parent tree. Circles of advance seedlings beneath scattered cherry trees and an absence of seedlings elsewhere are common occurrences in closed stands. As a result, the amount of black cherry advance reproduction is highly dependent on the number and distribution of seed-producing trees in the overstory (7). Songbirds distribute modest quantities of seeds in their droppings or by regurgitation. Omnivorous mammals, such as foxes and bears, also distribute seeds in their droppings. Bird and mammal distribution often accounts for a surprising abundance of advance cherry seedlings in stands lacking cherry seed producers. Seedling Development- Black cherry seeds require a period of after-ripening before germination will take place (22). Under natural conditions, this occurs during winter months in the forest floor. The usual pattern is for seeds of 1 year's crop to germinate over the following 3 or more years (45,77). Because of frequent seed crops and delayed germination, often a considerable quantity of viable cherry seeds is stored in the forest floor beneath cherry stands, freeing natural regeneration from dependency on current seed production (45). At the time of germination, the endosperm swells and splits the stone into two halves. Contrary to some beliefs, germination does not depend upon splitting of the seed coat by frost, or partial decomposition of the bony seed coat by soil organisms, or being passed through the digestive tract of birds. Germination is hypogeous; that is, the cotyledons remain below the soil surface (22). Seedbed requirements for germination are not rigid. Mineral soil is not required. In fact, germination is somewhat less on mineral soil than on undisturbed humus or leaf litter (37,43). Few seeds germinate in areas that have had the organic horizons stripped off or that are compacted by logging machinery. A moist seedbed is required for good germination, and burial of seeds to a depth of several inches is beneficial, apparently because it provides a stable moisture supply. Shade also improves germination by helping to maintain stable moisture. Germination is best beneath a canopy that represents 60 percent stocking or more, and germination decreases at lower canopy densities and is poorest in full sunlight (43,47). Under a forest canopy, myriads of cherry seedlings start in the vicinity of seed trees practically every year. Many of these survive 3 or 4 years even under the dense shade of an uncut stand, but few grow to be more than 12 or 15 cm (5 or 6 in) tall or survive more than 5 years under that low level of light. Nevertheless, those that die are quickly replaced by newly germinated seedlings, so a fairly dense understory of small black cherry seedlings is often present under seed-producing stands of black cherry. Where canopy density has been reduced by partial cutting, cherry advance seedlings survive longer and grow taller in response to the higher level of light (47,49). Overstory stocking levels of 50 to 70 percent provide optimum conditions for establishment of black cherry advance reproduction (48). Good germination and high survival provide for maximum seedling numbers at this level, and seedling heights of 0.3 to 0.6 in (I to 2 ft) are achieved in about 5 years. Best height growth of established seedlings, however, occurs in full sunlight (43,49). Black cherry seedlings reach a height of 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) within 30 days of germination. Under dense shade they do not grow much more, averaging less than 3 cm (1 in) of growth per year until they die because of lack of light. In the open, cherry stems have the potential to grow faster than most associated species. Juvenile height growth often averages 46 cm (18 in), and a few individuals may grow 91 cm (36 in) or more per year. With fertilization, annual terminal growth of 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) is common; growth of up to 2.4 in (8 ft) per year has been observed on some trees (1). Seedlings typically develop a taproot with numerous laterals during the first few years. Under adequate light, the roots penetrate 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) the first year in most soils. Well before black cherry reaches sapling size, a spreading form of root system develops in which a distinct taproot is no longer evident (36). Black cherry advance seedlings more than 15 cm (6 in) tall and at least 2 years old survive well and grow rapidly after exposure to full sunlight. Smaller seedlings survive in somewhat lower numbers, but they can be important sources of regeneration too. Smaller seedlings survive better if they grow under a partially cut canopy before release rather than under an uncut canopy (53). A two-cut shelterwood sequence provides the best conditions for the establishment and subsequent growth of black cherry regeneration. The seed cut should reduce the overstory to 50 or 60 percent relative density to provide for establishment of a large number of seedlings of modest size. A removal cut 5 to 10 years later releases the established seedlings for rapid growth and development (49). In some stands, adequate numbers of advance seedlings are present naturally, and the overstory removal or clearcut can be made without an earlier seed cut (25). The presence of advance seedlings is critical, however, and clearcutting may not regenerate cherry in stands where advance seedlings are lacking, especially where deer browsing, interfering plants, or other factors limit reproduction (55,56). Some black cherry seedlings do become established after removal cutting, and these supplement those that originated as advance seedlings. But direct exposure to sunlight is not conducive to best germination. For this reason, small clearcut patches or strips often provide better regeneration than large block clearcuts (36), except where advance seedlings are adequate by themselves. In stands where all species start at the same time, cherry quickly overtops tolerant species (51). Under partial shade, however, height growth of cherry is often less than that of its tolerant associates (48), and cherry is far less likely to grow into the main canopy through small gaps created by removal of a single tree. As a result, single-tree selection cutting generally discriminates against black cherry reproduction (46). Vegetative Reproduction- Black cherry readily sprouts from stumps and the sprouts grow rapidly, especially in full sunlight. Small, suppressed seedlings that have been released from overhead shade but which are bent or broken by logging operations will produce well-formed sprouts from the root collar (63). These seedling sprouts are an important and highly desirable source of regeneration. Even large old stumps sometimes are capable of sprouting; a 258-year-old, 122-cm (48-in) d.b.h. black cherry sprouted when cut. Maximum sprouting occurs in trees less than 40 or 50 years of age however. Clearcuttings of very young second growth cherry stands has resulted in third growth cherry stands in which more than half of the trees were of sprout origin (36). Sprouts of cherry tend to have poorer form than comparable seedlings but grow faster than seedlings during the first 20 to 30 years. Although trees of seedling or seedling-sprout origin are preferred for timber production, usually several stems of each sprout clump are capable of growing into high quality sawtimber (41,78). The incidence of butt rot from the parent stump is not as great in black cherry sprouts from stumps as large as 25 cm (10 in) in diameter or from stumps that have been overgrown by their sprouts by 35 years of age (8). Thus, sprouts of good form originating low on the stump are not discriminated against in silvicultural operations.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Cherry,prunus,serotina,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Black cherry grows very fast in the seedling, sapling, and pole stages, generally outgrowing and overtopping common associates such as sugar maple and beech. This gives rise to evenaged stands that are distinctly stratified into crown layers and diameters based on species. Black cherry generally occupies the dominant and codominant crown strata, while sugar maple and beech occupy an intermediate or suppressed crown position. Where present, species of intermediate tolerance such as red maple and white ash tend to be intermediate in crown position and size between the cherry and the sugar maple and beech. In stands where tolerant sugar maple and beech are present in the dominant crown positions alongside black cherry, the tolerants are often residuals of the previous stand that had a distinct head start on the cherry (51). Black cherry maintains its growth advantage over associated species for 60 to 80 years, so the proportion of the basal area or volume in cherry tends to increase over time in mixed stands. By age 60, codominant red maple diameter growth is often as good as or better than that of codominant cherry. Beyond age 80 to 100 years, diameter growth slows, mortality of cherry increases rapidly, and the importance of the species in the stand declines. However, few stands of such age are available to judge the rapidity with which cherry disintegrates at advanced ages. Site index curves for black cherry on the Alleghany Plateau have recently been developed (2). Average annual diameter growth of black cherry dominants and codominants might be 0.65 cm (0.25 in) between ages 10 and 40 years, 0.5 cm (0.20 in) between ages 40 and 70 years, and 0.4 cm (0.15 in) between ages 70 and 100 years. Growing space requirements for black cherry are considerably lower than for the associated species (except for hemlock) (71). Thus, stands containing a high percentage of black cherry carry more basal area and more volume per acre than stands with a low percentage of cherry. For example, full stocking for stands with a quadratic average stand diameter of 25 cm (10 in) is 31.7 m² of basal area per hectare (138 ft²/acre) if there is 20 percent cherry, and 42.2 m²2 (184 ft² if there is 80 percent cherry. Maximum stocking also varies with stand diameter. Stocking is 31.7, 37.0, and 40.4 m²/ha (138, 161, and 176 ft²/acre) at average quadratic stand diameters of 15, 25, and 35 cm (6, 10, and 14 in), respectively, for stands with 50 percent cherry (67,72). Rooting Habit- The root system of black cherry is predominantly spreading and shallow, even in well-drained soils. Most roots are restricted to the upper 60 cm (24 in) of soil or less, with occasional sinker roots extending to depths of 90 to 120 cm (36 to 48 in). On wet sites, the tendency toward shallow rooting is especially pronounced. Because of this tendency to grow taller than associated species in mixed stands, cherry is vulnerable to windthrow, especially on poorly drained soils and at older ages (36). Reaction to Competition- Black cherry is classed as intolerant of shade. Although black cherry seedlings are common under uncut stands and survive for 3 to 5 years, they do not live for extended periods or move up into larger size classes without moderate to heavy opening of the overstory canopy. In sapling and larger sizes, black cherry trees are considered very intolerant of competition. Cherry trees are found primarily in the dominant and codominant crown classes. Those individuals that drop to lower crown levels decline in growth and soon die. Thus, diameter distribution of black cherry in even-aged stands follows the bell-shaped curve typical of intolerant species (51). Black cherry dominants and codominants respond to thinning with slight to moderate increases in diameter growth, especially at ages up to 50 or 60 years (17,36,54). But thinning does not generally produce a response in trees that have been suppressed. Even early thinnings and cleanings intended to elevate intermediate or suppressed cherry to codominate crown positions generally have failed (13,73). Even-aged silviculture best satisfies the silvical requirements for black cherry regeneration, using either clearcutting where advance seedlings are already present or shelterwood cutting to develop them where they are absent (56,58). Advance seedlings and seed stored in the forest floor generally make retention of seed trees unnecessary. Uneven-aged silviculture, especially single-tree selection, tends to gradually eliminate cherry from the stands, because cherry does Dot move up into the dominant canopy without at least moderate levels of sunlight (46) . Group selection cutting might maintain small percentages of cherry in unevenaged stands, though this has never been demonstrated clearly. Damaging Agents- The most important defoliating insects attacking black cherry include the eastern tent caterpillar (Malacosoma americanum) and the cherry scallop shell moth (Hydria prunivorata) (3). Infestations of these insects are sporadically heavy, with some apparent growth loss and occasional mortality if heavy defoliations occur several years in a row. Attacks by numerous species of insects cause gum defects in black cherry, resulting in reduced timber quality. Gum spots in the wood are often associated with the Agromyzid cambium miner (Phytobia pruni), the peach bark beetle (Phloeotribus liminaris), and by the lesser peachtree borer (Synathedon pictipes) (35,40,66). A wide variety of insects can cause injury to terminal shoots of black cherry seedlings and saplings, resulting in stem deformity. Archips spp. and Contarinia cerasiserotinae are among the more important (64). The most common disease is cherry leaf spot caused by Coccomyces lutescens (36). Large numbers of black cherry seedlings are sometimes weakened or killed by this disease. Repeated attacks reduce the vigor of larger trees. Most other foliage diseases cause little damage. Black knot, a native disease caused by the fungus Apiosporina morbosa is common on black cherry (27). It causes elongated rough black swellings several times the diameter of the normal stem. Small twigs may be killed within a year after infection. Large cankerous swellings, a foot or more in length, may occur on the trunks of larger trees, and where several such lesions are scattered along the bole, the tree is worthless for lumber. Cytospora leucostoma is the cause of a canker disease responsible for widespread branch mortality of black cherry in Pennsylvania (26). Common infection courts are decaying fruit racemes and bark fissures caused by excessive gum production following passage of the larvae of Phytobia pruni, a cambium mining insect. Several basidiomycete fungi that cause root and butt rot of living black cherry trees include Armillaria mellea, Coniophora cerebella, Polyporus berkeleyi, and Tyromyces spraguei. Many other fungi cause decay of the main trunk; these include Fomes fomentarius, Fomitopsis pinicola, Poria prunicola. P. mutans, and Laetiporus sulphureus (29,36). Damage caused by glaze storms exposes black cherry to infection by top-rot fungi (16). Porcupines girdle and kill black cherry trees and also consume bark, thereby providing entry points for fungi. Meadow mice and meadow voles girdle the stem near the ground (37). Such damage where grass or other herbaceous cover provides suitable habitat for the mice is probably one of the major causes of planting failure in unregenerated clearcuts and old fields. White-tailed deer, rabbits, and hare feed on black cherry seedlings (36). In parts of Pennsylvania, deer browsing is the most serious problem of black cherry. Reproduction sometimes is completely eliminated by browsing, and most regeneration cuts are affected by reduced stocking, delays in establishment, and shifts in species composition toward less palatable beech and striped maple (50,57). Damage is dramatic after clearcutting, but damage to advance reproduction also is important. In areas of high deer population such as Pennsylvania, successful reproduction can be assured only where advance seedlings are so abundant that deer cannot eat all of them in the few years required for them to grow out of reach (55,57). Black cherry fares somewhat better than associated species such as sugar maple, red maple, white ash, and yellowpoplar, which are preferred deer browse. Where successful regeneration develops after clearcutting in this region, it is often nearly pure black cherry. Guidelines and techniques for regenerating stands with black cherry have been developed (56,58). Cherry is somewhat more vulnerable to storm damage than many of its associates because it often towers above the general canopy in mixed stands. Sapling and pole-sized trees are frequently bent by glaze or wet snow, causing loss of the leader and severe crooks that make them unsuitable for sawtimber. Cherry trees make remarkable recovery after breakage, however, with little loss of diameter growth. Decay spreads more slowly in cherry than in some of the associated species, so long-term effects are less severe than they seem to be at first (36,65). Cherry trees of all sizes are highly susceptible to fire injury. Even large trees are killed by moderate to severe fire, but most resprout unless the fire was unusually hot. Black cherry is intolerant of flooding. Of 39 species studied in a Tennessee flood test, black cherry was the most sensitive to high water (28). Certain herbaceous plants interfere with establishment of black cherry regeneration through an allelopathic mechanism. Flat top aster (Aster umbellatus), rough stemmed goldenrod (Solidago rugosa), brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum) and wild oatgrass (Danthonia compressa) (30) release chemicals from their leaves or roots that sometimes interfere with black cherry growth and development. Woodland fern and grasses may also interfere with black cherry regeneration, through a complex of mechanisms that involve both light and nitrogen effects (31,34). Black cherry may interfere with regeneration of other tree species, such as red maple (32), but this has not been investigated thoroughly.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Cherry,prunus,serotina,hardwood,14,0
"Throughout its range in eastern North America, black cherry grows well on a wide variety of soils if summer growing conditions are cool and moist. In Canada it grows near sea level, whereas in Appalachian coves it exists at elevations up to 1520 m (5,000 ft) or more (36). Best development occurs on the Allegheny Plateau at elevations of 300 to 790 m (1,000 to 2,600 ft). On the Allegheny Plateau, black cherry develops well on all soils except for the very wettest and very driest (36). There seem to be no major changes in site quality between soils developed from glacial till and those of residual origin. Black cherry tolerates a wide range of soil drainage. It grows about the same on well-drained sites as on somewhat poorly drained sites but shows rapid loss in productivity with increasingly wetter conditions (6,12). The dry soils of ridge tops and of south- and west-facing slopes are less favorable for black cherry than the moist soils of middle and lower slopes on north and east exposures (15,36) though these effects are much less pronounced on the Allegheny Plateau than in the steep topography of the Appalachians. Though great diversity exists, most of the forest soils important to black cherry are very strongly acid, relatively infertile, and have high, coarse fragment content throughout their profile. Kaolinite is the dominant clay mineral and is responsible for relatively low cation exchange properties (14). The bulk of the upland soils have textures that range from sandy loam to silty clay loam, and many soils have developed fragipans that impede drainage and restrict root growth (6,12,59). The large majority of upland soils are classified as Inceptisols or Ultisols according to present taxonomy, but Alfisols are also frequently present in colluvial landscape positions (59,75). Further southward throughout the Appalachian Highlands, black cherry generally grows on good to excellent sites as a scattered individual in association with other mesophytic hardwoods (36,74), and sometimes in nearly pure stands at high elevations on soils with impeded drainage. In the Lake States, black cherry prefers deep, well-drained soils and is adversely affected by increasingly poorer soil drainage (9).",Soils and Topography,Black Cherry,prunus,serotina,hardwood,15,0
"Black cherry fruits are an important source of mast for many nongame birds, squirrel, deer, turkey, mice and moles, and other wildlife. The leaves, twigs, and bark of black cherry contain cyanide in bound form as the cyanogenic glycoside, prunasin (33). During foliage wilting, cyanide is released and domestic livestock that eat wilted foliage may get sick or die (38). Deer eat unwilted foliage without harm (36). The bark has medicinal properties. In the southern Appalachians, bark is stripped from young black cherries for use in cough medicines, tonics, and sedatives (36,39). The fruit is used for making jelly and wine. Appalachian pioneers sometimes flavored their rum or brandy with the fruit to make a drink called cherry bounce. To this, the species owes one of its names-rum cherry (36).",Special Uses,Black Cherry,prunus,serotina,hardwood,16,0
"Black cottonwood often forms extensive stands on alluvial sites at low elevations along the Pacific coast. Arborescent willows are its major associates in two cover types (3): Black Cottonwood-Willow (Society of American Foresters Type 222) and Cottonwood-Willow (Type 235). In the latter type, balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) is the dominant cottonwood. Major willow species are Pacific (Salix lasiandra), northwest (S. sessilifolia), river (S. fluviatilis), and Scouler (S. scouleriana) willow (4). In other coastal forests, black cottonwood grows in mixture with red alder (Alnus rubra), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), grand fir (Abies grandis), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), black hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii), and several birch (Betula spp.) and cherry (Prunus spp.) species. Associates in interior forests may include western white pine (Pinus monticola), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), white fir (Abies concolor), western larch (Larix occidentalis), subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), white spruce (Picea glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Shrub species associated with black cottonwood include vine maple (Acer circinatum), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) and other Cornus spp., beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), Nootka rose (Rosa nutkana), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), salmonberry (R. spectabilis), elder (Sambucus spp.), bearberry honeysuckle (Lonicera involucrata), spirea (Spiraea spp.), and common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus). Herbaceous associates include swordfern (Polystichum munitum), lady fern (Athyrium filix-femina), horsetail (Equisetum spp.), stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), hedge nettle (Stachys spp.), false solomons-seal (Smilacina stellata), Canada violet (Viola canadensis), jewelweed (Impatiens spp.), enchanters nightshade (Circaea alpina), golden-saxifrage (Chrysosplenium spp.), buttercup (Ranunculus spp.), bittercress (Cardamine spp.), angelica (Angelica spp.), loosestrife (Lysimachia spp.), bedstraw (Galium spp.), and iris (Iris spp.). Presence of some of these understory species provides an indication of site quality in British Columbia (27). Good black cottonwood sites are characterized by salmonberry, nettles, swordfern, and lady fern, as well as vigorous growth of beaked hazel and elder. On medium sites, red-osier dogwood, bearberry honeysuckle, common snowberry, and sometimes thimbleberry and Nootka rose are common. Poor sites are commonly subject to prolonged flooding, and horsetails are dominant.",Associated Forest Cover,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,1,0
"Populations of black cottonwood grow in climates varying from relatively and to humid, but best growth is attained in the humid coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest (23). Annual precipitation ranges from 250 min (10 in) to more than 3050 min (120 in). Only about one-third of the annual precipitation occurs during the growing season, and in mountainous and inland areas much of the dormant-season precipitation falls as snow. The frost-free period ranges from about 70 days in the interior areas to more than 260 days in southern California. Maximum temperatures range from 16° to 47° C (60° to 117° F); minimum temperatures, from 0° to –47° C (32° to –53° F).",Climate,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,2,0
"Black cottonwood hybridizes freely with balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) where the ranges of the two species overlap (35). Another natural hybrid, the Parry cottonwood, resulting from crosses with P. fremontii is native to California. A hybrid (Populus x generosa Henry) between P. angulata (now considered either a variety or cultivar of P. deltoides) and R trichocarpa was developed in England (24). Also, P. maximowiczii x trichocarpa and P. deltoides x P. trichocarpa hybrids have been planted in the northeastern United States. Recent work in which P. trichocarpa was crossed with superior selections of P. deltoides from the southern United States has produced hybrids of markedly superior growth performance (12,31).",Hybrids,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,9,0
"The range of black cottonwood extends northeast from Kodiak Island along Cook Inlet to latitude 62° 30° N., then southeast in southeast Alaska and British Columbia to the forested areas of Washington and Oregon, to the mountains in southern California and northern Baja California (lat. 31° N.). It is also found inland, generally on the west side of the Rocky Mountains, in British Columbia, western Alberta, western Montana, and northern Idaho.

"Black cottonwood exhibits considerable variation throughout its range. Photoperiodic studies conducted under uniform environmental conditions in Massachusetts have shown that northern provenances cease growth earlier than southern provenances (21). Moreover, cessation of growth among clones from the same latitude was related to length of the growing season (frost-free days) at places of origin (that is, elevation). Another study (18) conducted with clones indicates that several aspects of shoot growth are under genetic control: date of flushing, amount of early growth, growth rate in midseason, date of cessation, and average length of internode. A more recent study (36) demonstrated a large range of variation in leaf, branch, and phenology characters in 50 clones (five each from 10 natural populations growing in drainages west of the Cascade Range). Population means for several characters varied clinally with source latitude, longitude, and/or elevation. In general, southwestern clones developed smaller leaves, had more numerous and more erect branches, and continued growth later in the fall than northeastern clones. Experiments in pots and flats have shown that some clones of black cottonwood grow taller in the presence of another clone than when planted by themselves (32).",Population Differences,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Black cottonwood is normally dioecious; male and female catkins are borne on separate trees. The species reaches flowering age at about 10 years (25). Flowers may appear in early March to late May in Washington and Oregon, and sometimes as late as mid-June in northern and interior British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. Staminate catkins contain 30 to 60 stamens, elongate to 2 to 3 cm (0.8 to 1.2 in), and are deciduous. Pistillate catkins at maturity are 8 to 20 ern (3.2 to 8 in) long with rotund-ovate, three carpellate subsessile fruits 5 to 8 min (0.20 to 0.32 in) long. Each capsule contains many minute seeds with long, white cottony hairs. Seed Production and Dissemination- The seed ripens and is disseminated by late May to late June in Oregon and Washington, but frequently not until mid-July in Idaho and Montana (23). Abundant seed crops are usually produced every year. Attached to its cotton, the seed is light and buoyant and can be transported long distances by wind and water. Although highly viable, longevity of black cottonwood seed under natural conditions may be as short as 2 weeks to a month. There is some evidence, however, to suggest a somewhat longer lifespan under apparently adverse conditions. With proper drying and cold storage, viability and capacity to germinate can be maintained for at least 1 year (25). Seedling Development- Moist seedbeds are essential for high germination (23), and seedling survival depends on continuously favorable conditions during the first month (25). Wet bottom lands of rivers and major streams frequently provide such conditions, particularly where bare soil has been exposed or new soil laid down. Germination is epigeal. Black cottonwood seedlings do not usually become established in abundance after logging unless special measures are taken to prepare the bare, moist seedbeds required for initial establishment (23). Where seedlings become established in great numbers, they thin out naturally by age 5 because the weaker seedlings of this shade-intolerant species are suppressed (23). Vegetative Reproduction- Black cottonwood sprouts readily from stumps, and in one study, satisfactory coppice reproduction was obtained four times in 2-year cutting cycles (8). After logging operations, black cottonwoods sometimes regenerate naturally from rooting of partially buried fragments of branches (9). Sprouting from roots has also been reported (23). The species also has the unusual ability to abscise small shoots complete with green leaves (6). These shoots drop to the ground and may root where they fall or may be dispersed by water transport. In some situations, abscission may be one means of colonizing exposed sandbars. The species is easily reproduced by rooted and unrooted cuttings (30). The cuttings are made in the dormant season and may be as short as 15 cm (6 in). Most research and small-scale operational plantings have been established with unrooted stem cuttings taken from 1- and 2-year-old wood, I to 3 em (0.4 to 1.2 in) in diameter at the small end and 40 to 60 cm (16 to 24 in) long. Good results have also been obtained with branchwood cuttings, in some instances collected from trees as old as 30 years (9). Usually the cuttings are planted in the spring to a depth of 80 to 40 em (12 to 16 in). Best establishment and growth are achieved when cuttings have healthy axillary buds, at least one of which remains above ground after planting (22). Plantings of very long cuttings (3 in or 10 ft or more in length) have sometimes been used successfully to overcome problems of weed competition or animal damage (29); in other cases, they have failed, presumably because top growth and thus transpiration stress outstripped root growth and the ability of the root system to provide moisture during the dry summer. The proportion of trees with poor form and the magnitude of crookedness are greater in trees established with long cuttings than with short cuttings (10). Height of trees established from cuttings has frequently exceeded 1.5 in (5 ft) at the end of the first year and 6 in (20 ft) after 4 years (11). Height growth rates of cottonwood sprouts have been even greater.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Black cottonwood may attain pulpwood size in 10 to 15 years, and saw log-size trees have been observed in plantations less than 25 years old in British Columbia and Washington. For example, dominant and codominant trees of 17 cm (6.7 in) in d.b.h. and 14.8 m (48.5 ft) in height at 9 years have been reported for a good moist site (26). In the lower Fraser River Valley of British Columbia, planted black cottonwoods averaged 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. and 16.8 m (55 ft) in height at 10 years, and some individual trees were more than 30 ern (12 in) in d.b.h. and 21.3 m (70 ft) in height (29). Growth is considerably less in northerly and interior locations. In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, black cottonwood matures in 60 years or less (23), but studies in British Columbia show that the species grows well for as long as 200 years (33). Exceptional trees have attained 180 to 300 cm. (72 to 120 in) in d.b.h. and more than 60 m (200 ft) in height (7,35). Growth and yield data for natural black cottonwood stands are available for the Quesnel region and Skeena River Valley of British Columbia (33). Other Canadian studies have indicated that three site quality classes developed for German poplar (16) are satisfactory for black cottonwood stands in British Columbia (30). The Forest Inventory Branch of the British Columbia Forest Service has collected much growth and yield data on natural stands of black cottonwood. Some of this information is summarized in table 1. These data clearly indicate that differences in yield among site classes are large; the mean annual production of site I is nearly twice that of site II, and more than three times that of site III. Yields from black cottonwood plantations are expected to be much higher than yields from natural stands. Data from three plantations in the lower Fraser River Valley indicate mean annual increments ranging from 10.5 to 15.4 m³/ha (150 to 220 ft³/acre) per year (28). A plantation established on a deep alluvial soil in coastal Washington has produced more than 500 m³/ha (7,242 ft³/acre) in 24 years (19). Dominant trees range from 35 to 37 m (115 to 122 ft) in height and 33 to 41 cm (13 to 16 in) in d.b.h. Rooting Habit- Planted cuttings of black cottonwood root very well; they produce deep and widespread root systems if growth is not restricted by adverse soil conditions. Little information on rooting has been collected in natural or seedling stands. Reaction to Competition- Black cottonwood is classed as very intolerant of shade. It grows best in full sunlight. On moist lowland sites, it makes rapid initial growth and thereby survives competition from slower growing associated species. Data from British Columbia indicate that black cottonwood trees can take advantage of wide initial spacing (1); diameters of trees and sets established at a 9.14-m (30-ft) spacing averaged 30 to 75 percent greater than those of plants established at a 1.82-m (6-ft) spacing (28,29). Results from a spacing trial in Washington, however, indicate better height and diameter growth at 3.7- by 3.7-m (12- by 12-ft) spacing than at 3.0- by 9.1-m (10- by 30-ft) and 6.1- by 9.1-m (20- by 30-ft) spacings (10). Black cottonwood responds well to thinning (29). In the past decade, most of the research on black cottonwood has focused on use of the species in short-rotation, coppice systems for fiber and energy. Spacings have varied from 0.3 by 0.3 m (1 by 1 ft) to 1.8 by 1.8 m (6 by 6 ft) and rotations or cutting cycles of 2 to 8 years (8,11,12,14). Mean annual production has ranged from about 2 to more than 16 mg/ha (1 to 7 tons/acre). The most recent findings suggest that rotations longer than 4 years (perhaps 8 or more) result in highest mean annual production (11); with such rotations, spacings of 1.8 by 1.8 in (6 by 6 ft) or wider may be used, provided that competition from grass and weeds is controlled. Higher coppice yield was obtained in a mixed planting of black cottonwood and red alder (a nitrogen-fixing species) than from pure plantings of either species (2). A subsequent study of the black cottonwood-alder mixture on a better site showed no benefits after the second year, presumably because cottonwood shaded and overtopped alder and thus impaired nitrogen fixation (13). Damaging Agents- Young saplings are frequently injured and sometimes killed by unseasonably early or late frosts (23). Frost cracks also lower quality of wood and provide an entrance for decay fungi (30). Ice storms and heavy snowfall cause considerable breakage and permanent bending (29). Wind damage is common, especially in stands where black cottonwood trees are much taller than surrounding vegetation; top breakage and bending result. Erosion along rivers and major streams also takes its toll in adjacent black cottonwood stands. The species is highly susceptible to fire damage. Mammals can create serious problems in black cottonwood plantations, especially at time of establishment or soon after. Meadow voles and meadow mice can cause severe losses in young plantations; such damage occurs most commonly on grassy or herb-covered sites. The voles feed on roots and sometimes girdle the lower stem. In some locations, rabbits and hares cause losses in young cottonwoods via clipping and basal girdling damage. Damage also results when beavers use cottonwood for food and construction of dams. Browsing and trampling of saplings by elk and deer sometimes decimate small, isolated plantings. Slugs have girdled cottonwood stems and presumably have eaten buds and newly emergent leaves of recently planted cuttings in the lower Columbia River valley. Although several insects attack black cottonwood (5,17), none has yet been reported as a pest of economic significance. Foliar feeders include tent caterpillars (Malacosoma spp.), two sawflies (Phyllocolpa bozemani and Nematus currani), the satin moth (Leucoma salicis), and a leaf blotch miner (Agromyza albitarsis). Oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes u1mi) was reported as frequently killing twigs and branches, and sometimes a whole tree. A bud midge (Contarinia spp.) caused considerable injury to buds of stressed trees (e.g., nursery-grown trees that have been transplanted, and trees on dry sites or in dry years) (9). A small bark moth (Laspeyresia populana) mines the cambium of the trunk and larger branches. Two borers feed under the bark and in the wood, a flatheaded borer (Poecilonota montana) and the poplar- and-willow borer (Cryptorhynchus lapathi). The latter is a European insect that is now established throughout much of the range of black cottonwood and has caused some damage in cottonwood plantings. Other flatheaded and roundheaded borers and ambrosia beetles are known to destroy the wood of black cottonwood. At least 70 fungal species cause decay in cottonwood, but only six fungi cause significant losses in British Columbia; two of these (Spongipellis delectans and Pholiota destruens) cause 92 percent of the loss (15,17,33). A leaf rust (Melampsora spp.) has been observed in young plantations, and susceptibility to the rust appears to vary greatly across the geographic range of the species. This disease limits photosynthesis and causes leaves to fall prematurely, thereby decreasing tree growth and vigor. Severe Melampsora infections have been observed when clonal material from relatively dry areas (e.g., east of the Cascade Range in Washington or Oregon and northern California) was planted in western Washington (9); in one instance, such infections resulted in death of the clones. Other foliage diseases include leaf-spot syndrome (Venturia populina) and yellow-leaf blister (Taphrina populisalicis). A deformity of catkins is caused by Taphrina johansonii. Cytospora canker (Cytospora chrysosperma) is widespread under forest conditions but rarely causes significant damage in vigorous cottonwood stands. It may cause problems, however, to cuttings in nurseries and plantations. Stem cankers in various areas have been reported as caused by Dothichiza populea, Fusarium spp., Hypoxylon mammatum, Nectria galligena, and Septoria musiva. None appear to be of great significance in management of black cottonwood, but severe attacks of a bacterial canker have reportedly limited planting of the species in Europe. Black cottonwood is also subject to the condition known as wet wood, which leads to wood collapse during drying.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,14,0
"Black cottonwood grows on a variety of soils and sites, from moist silts, sands, and gravels of islands and new river bars to rich humus soils, loams, and occasionally clay soils of upland sites (23). The most extensive black cottonwood stands are on soils of the order Entisols; the species also is common on Inceptisols and occasionally may be present on soils of other orders. High soil acidity (low pH) may restrict occurrence of black cottonwood on fine-textured soils where other site factors are favorable (9). Studies in British Columbia (27) have indicated that abundant moisture, nutrients, oxygen, and nearly neutral soil reaction (pH 6.0 to 7.0) are required for optimum production. Growth is best at low elevations on deep, moist alluvial soils, but some upland soils are productive cottonwood sites (27). The latter include loessial soils of high nutrient status in areas of abundant rainfall. Black cottonwood grows from sea level to 600 in (2,000 ft) on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska and up to 1500 in (5,000 ft) in the Cascade Range of Washington (23). In British Columbia, the elevation range extends to nearly 2100 m (7,000 ft) in the interior valleys of the Selkirk Range. In central and eastern Washington, as well as other dry areas, the species is usually limited to protected valleys and canyon bottoms, along stream banks and edges of ponds and meadows, and to moist toe slopes.",Soils and Topography,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,15,0
"Black cottonwood has been planted as windbreaks and shelterbelts in conjunction with irrigated agriculture in the Columbia River basin. The wood of black cottonwood is similar to that of other cottonwoods (20,34). It has light color, straight grain, fine, even texture, and is light in weight. It dries easily, is moderately stable in use, and, although not strong, is tough for its weight. Black cottonwood has short, fine fibers and is used to produce pulp for high-grade book and magazine papers. The species peels easily, and its veneer is used as core and cross-banding stock in plywood and in baskets and crates. The light weight, good nailing characteristics, and light color of the lumber are ideal for manufacture of pallets, boxes, and crates. The lumber is also used in concealed parts of furniture. Fiberboard and flakeboard are made from black cottonwood. In early days, it was used for cooperage.",Special Uses,Black Cottonwood,populus,trichocarpa,hardwood,16,0
"Black locust develops and grows best in cove or mixed mesophytic forests of the central and southern Appalachian Region. These forests are usually highly productive and characterized by a large and variable number of species. The species is often a component of mature forest on such sites but is seldom very abundant. Black locust is listed as a component of the Mixed Mesophytic Forest (6). In the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky, it made up about 1 percent of the mixed mesophytic forest on north and south slopes but is considered as more properly belonging to other communities and as a relict from preceding stages or accidentals from nearby unlike communities. It is not listed as a component of oak-hickory forest in the Ozark and Ouachita Highlands or of oak-chestnut forest in the southern Appalachians but is listed as an associate of shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and Table Mountain pine (P. pungens) in the oak-pine communities of the oak-chestnut forest region. In the forest cover type Black Locust (Society of American Foresters Type 50) the species is in pure stands or makes up the majority of stocking (15). Black locust is listed as an associate in only two other types: Yellow-Poplar (Type 57) and Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 59). Black locust is a pioneer type, usually man-influenced, and temporary. It follows disturbances and may be natural or planted. The type is found locally throughout the Eastern United States and in southern Canada. Black locust makes up a majority of the stand during early stages but is short lived and seldom matures to a sawtimber stand. A wide variety of species become associated with black locust and usually replace most of it. On good sites, single trees or small groups may persist, grow to a large size, and form a small part of the ultimate canopy layer.",Associated Forest Cover,Black Locust,robinia,pseudoacacia,hardwood,1,0
"The native range of black locust is classified as humid, with two local areas of superhumid climate (43). The range includes the cool temperate moist forest, warm temperate montane moist forest, warm temperate montane wet forest, and warm temperate moist forest life zones (38). Native black locust appears under the following ranges of climatic conditions (45). January normal daily temperatures: maximum, 2° to 13° C (36° to 55° F); minimum, -7° to 2° C (20° to 36° F); average -4° to 7° C (25° to 45° F); August normal daily temperatures: maximum, 27° to 32° C (81° to 90° F); minimum, 13° to 21° C (55° to 70° F); average, 18° to 27° C (64° to 81° F); mean length of frost-free period, 150 to 210 days; normal annual total precipitation, 1020 to 1830 mm (40 to 72 in); mean annual total snowfall, 5 to 152 em (2 to 60 in).

"Black locust is a variable species. Many cultural varieties have been recognized, especially in Europe. Forty-nine varieties have been tested in Hungary (23), and varieties have been selected that increase wood production 18 to 32 percent and nectar production 74 percent (31). In Korea, numerous studies have been conducted on the development, morphology, and cytological characteristics of spontaneous and colchicine-induced tetraploids of black locust (24). Shipmast locust (Robinia pseudoacacia var. rectissima), a clone of unknown origin, is listed by Little as a natural variety (27). After protein analysis and comparison; however, Huang and others consider shipmast locust an ecological variant and believe that it should not be given varietal status (22). Selection and propagation of trees with superior vigor, form, and resistance to borers have been attempted. The most promising selections were tested in several States. Early results indicate significant differences in borer attack between clones and between sites; however, differences were small and may have no practical application (33). Four hybrids are recognized (27). These are crosses with Kelsey locust, Robinia kelseyi Hutch. (R. x slavinii Rehd.); New Mexico locust, R. neomexicana Gray (R. x holtii Beissn.); clammy locust, R. viscosa Vent. (R. x ambigua Poir.); and bristly locust, R. hispida L.

"Black locust has a disjunct original range, the extent of which is not accurately known. The eastern section is centered in the Appalachian Mountains and ranges from central Pennsylvania and southern Ohio, south to northeastern Alabama, northern Georgia, and northwestern South Carolina. The western section includes the Ozark Plateau of southern Missouri, northern Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma, and the Ouachita Mountains of central Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. Outlying populations appear in southern Indiana and Illinois, Kentucky, Alabama, and Georgia (26).

"Flowering and Fruiting- The fragrant, whitish flowers, borne in showy racemes, appear after leaf emergence in May or June. The perfect flowers originate in the axils of current year leaves and are pollinated by insects, primarily bees. The fruit is a flattened, oblong pod that ripens during September and October. The fruit opens on the tree and seeds are dispersed from September to April (34). Seed Production- Black locust begins seed production at about age 6 and produces good crops at I- to 2-year intervals. Seed production is best between 15 and 40 years of age and continues until age 60. Black locust yields 7 to 15 kg (15 to 33 lb) of seeds per 45 kg (100 lb) of fruit, and seeds average 52,900/kg (24,009/lb) (34,37). Seedling Development- Because black locust has been widely planted, the proper seed treatment and nursery practices are well described. Dry seeds can be stored and retain their viability for as long as 10 years if placed in closed containers at 0° to 5° C (32° to 41° F). Because seed coats are impermeable, germination must be induced by scarification. Soaking in concentrated sulfuric acid, soaking in boiling or near-boiling water, and mechanical scarification have proved successful. Germination is epigeal (34). During seedling development, the first leaf appears within a week after germination and is 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long after 2 months. The young stems are zig-zag, round to slightly angular, and in the latter half of the first year develop pairs of thorns from stipules at the base of leaf petioles (29). Black locust seedlings grow rapidly when planted on good sites and competition is sparse. Control of competition aids in the establishment and growth of seedlings because black locust is intolerant of shade and herbaceous competition. In plantations in the Tennessee Valley, it was a very site-exacting species and grew poorly on severely eroded sites (1). Average annual height growth of 5-year-old plantations ranged from 0.3 m (1.1 ft) on severely sheet-eroded sites to 0.8 m (2.6 ft) on sites with little or no erosion. In the Central States, annual height growth for the first 10 years averaged 0.5 m (1.5 ft) on below-average sites but was 1.2 m (4 ft) or more on good sites (37). Black locust can be established on poor and disturbed sites. It has been widely planted for erosion control along roadsides and for reclamation of surface mine spoil banks. Throughout the Eastern and Central States, reclamation plantings have been successful across a wide range of spoil bank conditions. Vegetative Reproduction- Black locust sprouts readily from both stump and roots, especially after being cut or damaged. Although seedlings are produced, root suckers are most prevalent in natural reproduction. Suckers usually appear in the fourth or fifth year (37). In the southern Appalachians, dense thickets of suckers develop in clearcuts (4,28).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Locust,robinia,pseudoacacia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Black locust is a mediumsized tree, generally 12 to 18 m (40 to 60 ft) in height and 30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in) in diameter. On better sites it may reach 30 m (100 ft) in height and 122 cm (48 in) or more in diameter. The bole of opengrown trees is usually short and separates at 3 to 5 m (10 to 15 ft) into several stout branches, but in stands on good sites the bole is often clear and straight (18,19). Young trees grow very fast on good sites, but the species matures early and growth rate decreases rapidly after 30 years, especially on poor sites (table 1). Sprouts grow more rapidly than seedlings. Average yields from 27-year-old plantations in the Central States were 126 m³/ha (1,800 ft³/acre, 1,100 posts/acre, or 4,100 bd.ft./acre). On the best sites, black locust requires 15 to 20 years to produce post-size trees and 30 years to produce 20 cm (8 in) bolts (37). Little information is available on the growth and yield of black locust in natural stands, but numerous studies have documented its early growth in reclamation plantings (5,7,11,20,37). In West Virginia, slope percent, aspect, elevation, and extent of regrading accounted for 60 percent of height growth variation. Estimated annual height growth on surface-mined sites was tabulated (8). Early growth information is available for black locust plantations on abandoned fields in the Arkansas Ozarks (32). On the best 11-year-old plantations, heights ranged from 7.8 to 11.5 m (25.7 to 37.8 ft) and diameters ranged from 6.9 to 10.4 cm (2.7 to 4.1 in). Many of the plantations were complete failures, and established plantations were often severely damaged by insects. Rooting Habit- Black locust ordinarily produces a shallow and wide-spreading root system that is excellent for soil binding but is also capable of producing deep roots. In the and Southwest, trees may develop vertical roots from 6.1 to 7.6 m (20 to 25 ft) long (37). This deep rooting ability may explain why black locust can grow in and lands much drier than its native range. Radial root spread is about 1 to 1.5 times tree height (10). Reaction to Competition- Black locust is very sensitive to competition and is classed as very intolerant of shade (44). It is found in closed forest stands only as a dominant tree. Reproduction is not successful until perturbations create openings in which black locust, because of its rapid juvenile growth, can compete successfully. In open areas, dense herbaceous growth often prevents seedling establishment (37). On spoil banks in Illinois, survival rate of planted black locust was 83 percent on sparsely vegetated sites but was only 31 percent on densely vegetated sites (5). Except for reclamation, most forest managers consider this tree a weed species and a strong competitor against more desirable species. Two years after clearcutting a mixed hardwood stand from a good site on the southern Cumberland Plateau, 28 percent of all woody stems taller than 1.4 in (4.5 ft) were black locust. Ten years after clearcutting a high-quality hardwood stand in the southern Appalachians, the number of free-to-grow black locust had decreased but it was still the most abundant tree species (28). Dense black locust thickets occupied at least 15 percent of the area and suppressed the growth of more desirable species (4). Frill treatment with 2,4,5-T controlled the thickets. Glyphosate effectively controlled black locust in Christmas tree plantations in Maryland (17). Damaging Agents- Black locust is severely damaged by insects and disease, probably more than any other eastern hardwood species. Ubiquitous attacks by the locust borer (Megcallene robiniae) and by the heart rot fungi Phellinus rimosus or Polyporus robiniophilus make growing black locust for timber production impractical. Locust borer larvae construct feeding tunnels throughout the wood, and the holes serve as entry points for heart rot fungi that cause extensive wood decay. Locust borer attacks can begin at a young age and damage can be so extensive that trees are not suitable for fence posts. Many plantations planted in reclamation projects were seriously damaged, but more trees could be used if cut as soon as they reach post or mine-prop size. Slow-growing trees on poor sites are most susceptible to borer attack. On sites where tree vigor is low, repeated attacks often reduce black locust to sprout clumps. Damage to the sprouts is often as severe as in the original stem (37). Outbreaks of the locust leafminer (Odontota dorsalis) occur almost yearly. Black locust trees throughout an entire region are often defoliated, and during years of low rainfall many are killed. Attacks by the locust twig borer (Ecdytolopha insiticiana) occur over a wide area and in heavily infested areas seedling mortality may be high. Black locust is attacked by a wide variety of other insects that cause some degree of damage (3). Common diseases are heart rot and witches' broom disease, caused by a virus, Chlorogenus robiniae. In the southern Appalachians most large trees are infected with heart rot and decay of trunk wood is extensive. In the Texas root-rot belt, black locust is extremely susceptible to Phymatotrichum omnivorum (21). In New Brunswick, plantings of black locust are not recommended because of high mortality and dieback of branches caused by Nectria cinnabarina and because of superior performance by conifer species (40). Although black locust is moderately frost hardy in the southern and central Plains, cold weather damage has occurred in the colder parts of its range (37). In the Appalachian region, it is highly susceptible to frost damage (44). Although the species has been reported to be very susceptible to fire damage, researchers concluded that parts of a study area in Illinois would be rapidly converted to black locust thickets if fire was the only management tool used (2).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Locust,robinia,pseudoacacia,hardwood,14,0
"Black locust grows naturally over a wide range of soils and topography. The most common orders of soil within its native range are Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols, and the most common soil great groups are Hapludults, Paleudults, Dystrochrepts, and Eutrochrepts (41). The species does best on moist, rich, loamy soils or those of limestone origin and thrives best on moist slopes of the eastern mountains below 1040 in (3,400 ft) (18,21). In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the upper elevational limit is 1620 ni (5,300 ft) (46). Black locust has become established on a wide variety of disturbed sites such as old fields or other cleared areas. Black locust is very sensitive to poorly drained or compact plastic soils. Excessively dry sites are also poor for the species. Yellow, brown, or reddish-brown subsoils without pronounced mottling are better than gray, bluish-gray, or yellow subsoils mottled any color. Silt loams, sandy loams, and the lighter textured soils are superior to clay, silty clay loams, and the heavier soils. In the Central States, growth of black locust plantations was found to be closely correlated to plasticity, compactness, and structure of the subsoil, all of which influence drainage and aeration. Growth was unfavorably affected by insufficient or excessive drainage. Soil pH from 4.6 to 8.2 and the amount of mineral nutrients present showed no relationship to growth. Growth was best on limestone-derived soils and soils without pronounced subsoil development (37). On West Virginia spoil banks, black locust was the most successful species, but survival declined as slope increased. On slopes greater than 25 percent, each 10 percent increase in slope decreased survival 3.4 percent. On slopes steeper than 40 percent, growth was inversely related to slope steepness. Survival was about 80 percent at elevations of 340 to 670 m (1,100 to 2,200 ft). Above 670 m (2,200 ft), survival decreased steadily with increasing elevation and at 1330 m (4,350 ft) survival was less than 65 percent (7). Although black locust has done well in mine spoil banks in the Central States, it has failed consistently when planted on badly eroded, compacted, clayey soils of the southern Appalachian Region (21). In the Arkansas Ozarks, many plantations on worn out and eroded fields were complete failures. On the southwestern Coastal Plain of Arkansas, plantations on sites previously in agricultural crops failed because of slow growth due to low soil fertility, repeated attacks by the locust borer (Megacyllene robiniae), and invasion of pine (32).",Soils and Topography,Black Locust,robinia,pseudoacacia,hardwood,15,0
"Although black locust is not an important timber tree in the United States, it is used for a wide variety of products and is planted for many specialized purposes. It is used for fence posts, mine timbers, poles, railroad ties, insulator pins, ship timber, tree nails for wooden ship construction, boxes, crates, pegs, stakes, and novelties. Pulp with satisfactory mechanical properties can be made, particularly by the sulfate process (35). It is also suitable for use in fuel plantations (14,16). Black locust is widely planted in the United States, Europe, and Asia for erosion control, reclamation of drastically disturbed sites, windbreaks, nurse crops, amelioration of sites, honey production, and ornamental use. Many early plantations on severely eroded old fields were failures, but establishment on spoil banks has been generally successful. Black locust is often broadcast or hydroseeded with a mixture of herbaceous seed. The most commonly used seeding rate is 2.2 to 3.4 kg/ha (2 to 3 lb/acre) (12). Because of its soil-improving properties, black locust is often planted in mixtures. Many species have been underplanted in black locust stands. Success of such planting has been variable and many factors have to be considered carefully (37). On mine spoil in Illinois, black locust was a valuable nurse crop for black walnut (Juglans nigra), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), but not for cottonwood (Populus deltoides), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), or Osage-orange (Maclura pomifera) (25). On surface-mined land in Kansas, survival, growth, and form of black walnut were impaired when planted with black locust (39). Black locust was superior to other hardwoods in developing wildlife habitat on mine spoils. It quickly provided cover, and by 10 to 15 years native vegetation had established a dense undergrowth (36). Its seeds are rated low as wildlife food but are used to a limited extent by Northern bobwhite, other game birds, and squirrels (30,42). White-tailed deer browse the young growth, and a study in the southern Appalachians showed that 92 percent of the sprouts were browsed (13). Because older trees are usually infected with heart rot, woodpeckers often construct cavities in them. Nest cavities of the downy woodpecker, hairy woodpecker, and common flicker have been found (9).",Special Uses,Black Locust,robinia,pseudoacacia,hardwood,16,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Black oak is monoecious. The staminate flowers develop from leaf axils of the previous year and the catkins emerge before or at the same time as the current leaves in April or May. The pistillate flowers are borne in the axils of the current year's leaves and may be solitary or occur in two- to many-flowered spikes. The fruit, an acorn that occurs singly or in clusters of two to five, is about one-third enclosed in a scaly cup and matures in 2 years. Black oak acorns are brown when mature and ripen from late August to late October, depending on geographic location (28). Seed Production and Dissemination- In forest stands, black oak begins to produce seeds at about age 20 and reaches optimum production at 40 to 75 years. It is a consistent seed producer with good crops of acorns every 2 to 3 years. In Missouri, the average number of mature acorns per tree was generally higher than for other oaks over a 5-year period, but the number of acorns differed greatly from year to year and from tree to tree within the same stand (6). The number of seeds that become available for regenerating black oak may be low even in good seed years. Insects, squirrels, deer, turkey, small rodents, and birds consume many acorns. They can eat or damage a high percentage of the acorn crop in most years and essentially all of it in poor seed years (6,26). Black oak acorns from a single tree are dispersed over a limited area by squirrels, mice, and gravity (28). The blue jay may disperse over longer distances (7). Seedling Development- Black oak will be present to the same extent in newly reproduced stands as it was as advance reproduction before harvest cutting. New seedlings established at or just before harvest cutting grow too slowly to compete with sprouts of other tree species and other vegetation (25,27). To compete successfully in new stands black oak stems must be 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) tall and have well-developed root systems. Success in reproducing black oak depends on creating conditions within mature stands that will result in seedling establishment and conditions favoring their survival and growth (1,26). Black oak acorns germinate in the spring following seedfall. Germination is hypogeal (25,28). Most favorable conditions for germination occur when the acorns are in contact with or buried in mineral soil and covered with a light layer of litter. Acorns on top of the litter generally dry excessively during early spring and lose their viability before temperatures are favorable for germination. The primary root generally grows vigorously following germination (6,26). Seedlings can survive droughty conditions, but growth is slow or even ceases altogether. Black oak seedlings are more drought tolerant than northern red oak seedlings and about the same as white oak seedlings (29). Light intensity appears to be critical to the survival and growth of black oak seedlings. Light intensity under forest stands is often very low at the level of the new seedlings (about 15 cm or 6 in). In Missouri, light intensity at this level in forest stands was 10 percent or less of that in nearby open areas. The black oak seedlings in this study averaged 9 cm (3.5 in) tall at age 4, the same as they averaged at age 1 (26). Black oak seedlings that survive seldom remain true seedlings for more than a few years because drought, low light intensity, fire, animals, or mechanical agents kill the tops. Then, one or more dormant buds near the root collar produce new sprouts. This dieback and resprouting process can occur several times; thus the roots of black oak saplings may be 10 to 20 years older than the tops (27). Growth of black oak sprouts, like that of seedlings, is slow under forest stands. In Missouri, sprouts grew only 6 cm (2.4 in) in 4 years (26). Shoot elongation of black oak is episodic. Multiple shoot-growth flushes occur in both seedlings and sprouts when light, temperature, and moisture conditions are favorable. Only one growth flush occurs on stems growing in a shaded understory. Periods of active shoot growth are followed by distinctive rest periods, during which most of the annual root elongation occurs (22). Vegetative Reproduction- About 95 percent of the black oaks in newly reproduced stands created by clearcutting or final overstory removal are sprouts, either from advance reproduction or from stumps of cut trees (27). New sprouts from advance reproduction develop from dormant buds near the root collar when the old stems are cut or damaged during logging. These new sprouts grow rapidly and their height growth is related to the size of the old stem; the larger the old stem, the faster a new sprout will grow (23,24). Stumps of black oaks sprout less frequently than those of northern red, scarlet, and chestnut oaks and with about the same frequency as those of white oak (25). A Missouri study showed that sprouting frequency for black oak stumps is related to site index, tree age, and stump diameter. Small stumps from young trees on good sites sprout most frequently while large stumps from old trees on poor sites sprout least frequently (16). Black oak stump sprouts grow rapidly: in Missouri the height of dominant and codominant stems averaged 3.5 m (11.4 ft) at age 5. The probability that a stump with a living sprout I year old will have at least one dominant or codominant sprout at age 5 is predictable from stump diameter and ranges from near 1.0 for 7.6 cm (3 in) stumps to about 0.15 for 76 cm (30 in) stumps. Black oak stump sprouts may be a valuable component of newly reproduced stands, particularly if they originate at ground level. The low-origin sprouts are less susceptible to rot entering from the parent stump than the high-origin sprouts. Many develop into trees of good quality (27).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Oak,quercus,velutina,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Black oak becomes physiologically mature at about 100 years of age, some individuals living 150 to 200 years. On the best sites black oak trees may reach 46 m (150 ft) in height and 122 cm (48 in) in d.b.h., but most mature trees are 18 to 24 in (60 to 80 ft) tall and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. (6). Average diameter growth of black oak for a range of ages, sites, and stand conditions in the Central States was about 5 min (0.2 in) per year for 10 years. In West Virginia, dominant black oaks grew faster in diameter than scarlet, chestnut, and white oaks but slower than northern red oak (6). Average growing space requirements for oaks in even-aged stands in which black oak is a major component have been determined by Gingrich (9). Competition for growing space in these stands begins at the level of stocking where the total available space is equal to the total of the maximum requirement of all the trees in the stand. This level of stocking is about 60 percent of the maximum stocking a site can support and is the lowest level of stocking at which the stand will fully utilize the site. The maximum amount of growing space a black oak tree can use is 33.3 m³ (358 ft³) for a tree 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. and 115 m³ (1,233 ft³) for a tree 51 cin (20 in) in d.b.h. The minimum growing space required for trees is 13.5 m² (145 ft²) and 64.8 m² (697 ft²), respectively. Yields of unthinned, 80-year-old stands with black oak as a major component range from 75.6 m³ /ha (5,400 fbm/acre) on poor sites (site index 16.8 in (55 ft) at base age 50 years) to 175.0 m³ /ha (12,500 fbm/acre) on good sites (site index 22.9 in or 75 ft). Yields can be increased substantially by thinning regularly. At age 70, stands that are first thinned at age 20, with subsequent thinning at about 10-year intervals, yield from 102.9 m³/ha (7,350 fbm/acre) on poor sites to 278.3 m³ /ha (19,880/acre) on good sites (10). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Black oak is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. It is less tolerant than many of its associates such as white and chestnut oaks, hickories, beech (Fagus grandifolia), maples, elm, and blackgum; it is more tolerant than yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), black cherry, and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata); and it is about the same as northern red oak and scarlet oak. Seedlings usually die within a few years after being established under fully stocked overstories. Most black oak sprouts under mature stands develop crooked stems and flat-topped or misshapen crowns. After the overstory is removed, only the large stems are capable of competing successfully. Seedlings are soon overtopped. The few that survive usually remain in the intermediate crown class (6,24,27). Even-aged silvicultural systems satisfy the reproduction and growth requirements of black oak better than the all-aged or uneven-aged selection system (1,27). Under the selection system, black oak is unable to reproduce because of inadequate light. Stands containing black oak that are managed under the selection system will gradually be dominated by more shade-tolerant species. Black oak responds well to release if the released trees are in the codominant or above-average intermediate crown classes. The best response is obtained if release cuttings or thinnings are begun before a stand is 30 years old. Trees in stands older than 30 years that have always been fully stocked generally have small crowns that have been restricted too long. These are unable to make efficient use of the growing space provided by release or thinnings. Thus response is not as good as in younger stands (25). Ten years following release in an Arkansas study, diameter growth of 50-year-old black and northern red oak trees averaged 40 percent more than that of unreleased trees. Although the rate of diameter growth increased throughout the 10-year period, response was greater and more apparent ears 5-10. Dormant buds are numerous on the holes of black oak trees. These buds may be stimulated to sprout and produce branches by mechanical pruning or by exposure to greatly increased light, as by thinning heavily or creating openings in the stand. Dominant trees are less likely to produce epicormic branches than those in the lower crown classes (6,25). Damaging Agents- Wildfires seriously damage black oak trees by killing the cambial tissue at the base of the trees. This creates an entry point for decay fungi, and the end result is loss of volume because of heart rot. Trees up to pole size are easily killed by fire and severe fires may even kill sawtimber. Many of the killed trees sprout and form a new stand (6). However, the economic loss may be large unless at least some of it can be salvaged. Oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) is a potentially serious vascular disease of black oak that is widespread throughout the eastern United States. Trees die within a few weeks after the symptoms first appear. Usually scattered individuals or small groups of trees are killed, but areas several hectares (acres) in size may be affected. The disease is spread from tree to tree through root grafts and over larger distances by sap-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae) and the small oak bark beetle (6). Shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) attacks black oak and may kill trees weakened by fire, lightning, drought, insects, or other diseases. A root rot, Phytophthora cinnamomi, may kill seedlings in the nursery. Cankers caused by Strumella and Nectria species damage the holes of black oak but seldom kill trees. Foliage diseases that attack black oak are the same as those that typically attack species in the red oak group and include anthracnose (Gnomonia quercina), leaf blister (Taphrina spp.), powdery mildews (Phyllactinia corylea and Microsphaera alni), oak-pine rusts (Cronartium spp.), and leaf spots (Actinopelte dryina) (13). Tunneling insects that attack the boles of black oak and cause serious lumber degrade include the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), the twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus), the oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus), and the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus) (3). The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) feeds on foliage and is potentially the most destructive insect. Although black oaks withstood a single defoliation, two or three defoliations in successive years killed many trees in New Jersey (17). Other defoliators that attack black oak and may occasionally be epidemic are the variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), the orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), and the browntail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea). The nut weevils (Curculio spp.), gall-forming cynipids (Callirhytis spp.), filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus), and acorn moth (Valentinia glandulel1a) damage black oak acorns.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Oak,quercus,velutina,hardwood,14,0
"In southern New England, black oak grows on cool, moist Orthod Spodosols. Elsewhere it occurs on warm, moist soils including Udalf Alfisols, Udoll Mollisols, Udult Ultisols, small areas of Udipsamment Entisols, Dystrochrept Inceptisols, and in extreme northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania on Fragiochrept Inceptisols. The most widespread soils on which black oak grows are the Udalfs and Udolls (30). These soils are derived from glacial materials, sandstones, shales, and limestone and range from heavy clays to loamy sands with some having a high content of rock or chert fragments. Black oak grows best on welldrained, silty clay to loam soils. Black oak grows on all aspects and slope positions. It grows best in coves and on middle and lower slopes with northerly and easterly aspects. It is found at elevations up to 1200 m (4,000 ft) in the southern Appalachians (6). The most important factors determining site quality for black oak are the thickness and texture of the A horizon, texture of the B horizon, aspect, and slope position (2,4,13,20). Other factors may be important in localized areas. For example, in northwestern West Virginia increasing precipitation to 1120 mm (44 in) resulted in increased site quality; more than 1120 mm (44 in) had no further effect (2). In southern Indiana, decreasing site quality was associated with increasing slope steepness (13). Near the limits of black oak's range, topographic factors may restrict its distribution. At the western limits black oak is often found only on north and east aspects where moisture conditions are most favorable. In southern Minnesota and Wisconsin it is usually found only on ridgetops and the lower two-thirds of south- and west-facing slopes (6).",Soils and Topography,Black Oak,quercus,velutina,hardwood,15,0
"Black oak acorns are an important food for squirrels, white-tail deer, mice, voles, turkeys, and other birds (11). In Illinois, fox squirrels have been observed feeding on black oak catkins (14).

"Black spruce most commonly grows as pure stands on organic soils and as mixed stands on mineral soil sites. It is a major component of forest types with white spruce, balsam fir (Abies balsamea), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and tamarack and also grows in association with paper birch (Betula papyrifera), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), balsam poplar, northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), American elm (Ulmus americana), and red maple (Acer rubrum). In the southern parts of its range, black spruce is commonly found in mixed stands with several species, especially northern white-cedar, white spruce, balsam fir, and tamarack. In the main part of its range, it is commonly associated with white spruce, quaking aspen, balsam fir, paper birch, and tamarack. Jack pine is a common associate on dry sites. At the northern and northwestern limits of the range, pure stands are common, but black spruce is also found associated with paper birch, quaking aspen, white spruce, and tamarack. Because of its broad distribution and varying ecological site characteristics, the Black Spruce forest cover type (Society of American Foresters Type 12, eastern, and 204, western) (11) has been divided into six subtypes: (a) black spruce-feathermoss, most common in the southern and central boreal forest; (b) black spruce-lichen, most abundant near the northern limit of the boreal forest; (c) black spruce-dwarf shrub, in the southern and central portions of the boreal forest; (d) black spruce-sphagnum, on wet soils; (e) black spruce-speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), on waterlogged soils with standing or slowly flowing water; and (f) black spruce-sedge, on peatlands with minerally enriched moving water. Black spruce is also a major component of cover types Black Spruce-Tamarack (Type 13); Black Spruce-White Spruce (Type 253); and Black Spruce-Paper Birch (Type 254). One of the most conspicuous aspects of many black spruce stands is a nearly continuous ground cover of feathermosses (Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, and Ptilium crista-castrensis) and sphagnum mosses (Sphagnum spp.). On some sites, the moss layer is replaced by nearly continuous mats of lichens, primarily species of Cladonia; this is especially typical of open stands in northern areas where the open lichen woodland is a common vegetation type. The shrubs associated with black spruce change gradually from east to west. Dominant shrubs in the eastern range include mountain maple (Acer spicatum), beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), speckled alder, red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), and red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) on better sites; and low birch (Betula pumila), bog birch (B. glandulosa), bog-rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), lambkill (Kalmia angustifolia), Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and bog-laurel (Kalmia polifolia) on the less productive peatlands. In the western part of the range, littletree willow (Salix arbusculoides), grayleaf willow (S. glauca), Bebb willow (S. bebbiana), prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), American green alder (Alnus crispa), Labrador-tea, bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), and mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) are the most important shrubs. The most important herbs, found over most of the range, are panicle bluebells (Mertensia paniculata), fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), one-sided pyrola (Pyrola secunda), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), false lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum canadense), starflower (Trientalis borealis), bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), and sheathed cottonsedge (Eriophorum vaginatum).",Associated Forest Cover,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,1,1
"The climate for black spruce can be characterized as cold with a moisture regime varying from humid to dry subhumid. Mean annual temperatures range from 7° C (45° F) in the southern areas to -11° C (13° F) near tree line in central and western Canada. Average January temperatures range from -30° C (-22° F) in northwestern Canada and Alaska to -6° C (21° F) at the southeastern edge of its range. Average July temperatures range from 16° to 24° C (60° to 76° F) in the main part of the range of black spruce and from 10° to 27° C (50° to 80° F) in extreme locations. The extreme low temperatures range from -62° to -34° C (-79° to -30° F), the highs from 27° to 41° C (80° to 105° F). Annual precipitation decreases from east to west. In the maritime provinces, it may be as high as 1520 mm (60 in) and in western Alaska as low as 150 mm (6 in), but annual precipitation ranges from 380 to 760 mm (15 to 30 in) in most of the black spruce range. Much of the precipitation is snowfall-from 500 cm (200 in) in eastern Canada to 100 cm (40 in) in western Canada and central Alaska. Mean snow depths are 50 to 75 cm (20 to 30 in) over most of the range but may be more than 100 cm (40 in) in parts of Quebec and Labrador, where snow may persist into late May or early June. Maximum length of days during the growing season varies from continuous north of the Arctic Circle to about 16 hours near the southern limits of the range. The frost-free period varies from 140 days in the southeastern portions of the range to 60 days or less near tree line.",Climate,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,2,1
"Genetic variation in black spruce is clinal, primarily along a north-south geographical gradient. Differences in photoperiod response, productivity, and survival rate have been shown to be related to the geographical area of seed origin. Although black spruce ecotypes related to upland and peatland sites have been reported from some areas, they have not been recognized in several studies of black spruce variation. Seed zones should be recognized, but separation of seed by peatland and upland location is probably not necessary (30,31). Hybrids between black spruce and red spruce are common, and introgressive hybridization between the two species has been reported in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec (14,32). A natural hybrid between black spruce and white spruce found in northern Minnesota has been called the Rosendahl spruce (28). Intermediate forms between black and white spruce have been reported occasionally from other areas (41), but the genetic isolation of these two species must be nearly complete.",Genetics,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,7,1
"Black spruce ranges in a broad band from northern Massachusetts to northern Labrador on the Atlantic coast, west across Canada to the west coast of Alaska. Its southern limits consist of isolated patches in northern New Jersey, western Connecticut, Pennsylvania, southern Michigan, southern Wisconsin, southern Minnesota, and southern Manitoba; west across south-central Saskatchewan, Alberta, and central British Columbia. Its northern limit across Canada and Alaska is about that of the northern tree line, although it alternates with white spruce (Picea glauca), tamarack (Larix laricina), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as the tree line species at different points. The commercial range of black spruce is considerably less than its geographic range. - The native range of black spruce.",Native Range,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Black spruce is monoecious. Female flowers (ovulate strobili), produced in the upper meter of the crown, are usually erect, cylindrical, and green or purplish. At the time of fertilization, the female conelet is about 15 to 25 mm (0.6 to 1.0 in) in length. The male flowers (staminate strobili), produced on the outer branches of the crown below the zone of female flowers, are ovate, 12 to 20 mm (0.5 to 0.8 in) long and dark red to purplish during expansion. The pollen sacs are yellow, and after pollen dispersal the staminate flowers appear yellowish brown. A few cones may be produced after 10 years (2), but the main cone-bearing age of black spruce is from 30 to 250, with maximum production between 100 and 200 years (6). The flower buds formed by early August develop rapidly the following spring. Female flowers are receptive and pollen is shed in late May or early June in southern areas of the range and 1 to 2 weeks later in the north. The female conelets then develop rapidly, and at maturity the cones are 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) long. Seed Production and Dissemination- Black spruce seeds mature 3 months after pollination, in late August or early September. Some are produced almost every year, but heavy seed years occur at intervals of 2 to 6 years and peak crops every 4 years over most of the range. Good seed years may be less frequent in the north; vegetative reproduction of clonal populations occurs at the northern limit of black spruce in Canada (36). The cones of black spruce remain partially closed and disperse seed for several years, providing an adequate supply of seeds to reproduce the stand whenever fire occurs. Both the number and viability of the seeds decline rapidly, but some viable seeds may remain in the cones for as long as 25 years (15). In Minnesota, 1-year-old cones contained an average of 50 seeds; 7-year-old cones, 10 seeds; and 19-year-old cones, only 1 or 2 seeds (50). In Newfoundland, the number of seeds per cone was greatly reduced in 4 years (3.7 seeds per cone), but seed germination remained high (above 90 percent) for 12 years and then declined rapidly in older seeds (44). Black spruce seeds are dispersed throughout the year, but dispersal is highest in the spring and lowest in the fall (16). Fires open the cones and accelerate seed fall for periods of 60 days (55) to 2 to 3 years; the effect apparently varies with fire intensity. The average annual seedfall is about 490,000/ha (200,000/acre) for Minnesota (26) and substantially higher for Ontario- 2,450,000 to 4,180,000/ha (990,000 to 1,692,000/acre) (15). A maximum of 12,720,000 seeds per hectare (5,148,000/acre) has been reported from Ontario (29). In northern areas, even near tree line, amounts of seed are within the range of those from southern areas, with annual amounts from 590,000 to 1,300,000/ha (240,000 to 528,000/acre) reported from Inuvik in Northwest Territories (6) and 850,000/ha (344,000/acre) from central Alaska (49). Black spruce has the smallest seed produced by any spruce in North America, averaging 890,000/kg (404,000/lb). Despite their light weight and relatively large wings, the seeds are not commonly dispersed over long distances. Seed dispersal, primarily by wind, is effective up to 79 m (260 ft) from the windward edge of a mature stand (27). Seedling Development- Sphagnum mosses provide a continuously moist seedbed in many areas, but growth of black spruce seedlings may be slow in sphagnum moss because of a poor supply of nutrients (23,24), and they may not be able to keep ahead of some fast-growing sphagnum species that eventually overtop them. Feathermosses may provide a suitable seedbed during wet years, but they are unreliable and usually dry out before penetration by the seedling root occurs. Moist mineral soils usually provide good seedbeds for black spruce, but exposed mineral soil may be too waterlogged or subject to frost heaving in some low-lying areas (23). Fires that completely remove the surface organic layer usually provide good seedbeds for black spruce. Slash removal by broadcast burning or full-tree skidding is also beneficial (8,26). Seedling mortality seems to be highest on burned duff and lowest on some moss and mineral soil surfaces with an adequate moisture regime. Seedbed scarification increases stocking. Under optimal climatic conditions, direct seeding on these scarified surfaces results in seedlings representing 10 to 30 percent of the sown seed (25,56). A sowing of 79,000 seeds per hectare (32,000/acre) should result in at least 60 percent milacre (4.05 m² or 43.56 ft²) stocking of seedlings, which is considered satisfactory (26). Spring sowing results in the best germination and survival, and viability is drastically lowered if germination does not occur during the same year (13,56). Germination is epigeal (42). Nursery-grown transplants (2-2) survive better, grow faster, and are more economical than seedlings (3-0) when black spruce plantations are established (34,35). Average initial height growth of black spruce seedlings varies from 2.5 cm (1 in) per year on moss to 15 cm (6 in) per year on some mineral soil substrates, but annual growth may be as low as 5 mm (0.2 in). Vegetative Reproduction- Layering is an important means of reproduction in black spruce on some sites, especially where rapidly growing mosses cover the lower branches of the slow-growing seedlings and saplings (45). Layerings from the lower branches develop most abundantly in the more opengrown, poorer stands and less frequently in dense, productive stands. Layering is common in black spruce growing at tree line, probably as a result of depression of the lower branches by snow, and accounts for the presence of ""candelabrum"" spruce, a circular clump originating from one individual with the tallest tree in the center. Layering is also common in black spruce/speckled alder communities on organic soils but is rare in well-stocked black spruce/Labrador-tea stands (45). The trees established from layerings constitute advance growth on some sites and are particularly important where logging disturbance is light. Black spruce may reproduce from shoots originating from roots (12), but this is uncommon. Cuttings from black spruce seedlings can be rooted successfully with periodic misting but without application of auxins (3).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Under normal unmanaged conditions, black spruce at maturity averages 12 to 20 m (40 to 65 ft) tall and about 23 cm (9 in) in d.b.h. on good sites; 8 to 12 m (25 to 40 ft) and about 13 cm (5 in) in d.b.h. on poor sites. Extreme sizes vary from semiprostrate shrubs or trees to 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft) tall and 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in d.b.h. in the far north to occasional individuals that are about 27 m (90 ft) tall and 46 cm (18 in) in d.b.h. in the Ontario Clay Belt (12,50). Average maximum age is about 200 years, but ages up to 280 years have been reported. Volumes of 196 m³/ha (2,800 ft³/acre) are common in 80- to 100-year-old stands on the best peatlands and good upland sites in southern Canada and the Lake States (12). One unmanaged stand had a total volume of 492 m³/ha (7,024 ft³/acre) and a basal area of 53.5 m²/ha (233 ft²/acre) when it was slightly more than 100 years old. Regional differences in the site index of black spruce are apparently related to climatic factors, whereas differences within regions are associated with soil moisture and nutrients. The moisture-aeration regime influences growth more than the nutrient regime (22). Within peatlands, water chemistry-as determined by water sources and movement-seems to be the principal factor influencing site quality (19). Black spruce site index curves differ among regions and substrates. For example, the curves are lower at older ages in Newfoundland than in continental Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario, the height-growth patterns of black spruce are different for peatland and upland stands, particularly for site indexes less than 8 m (26 ft) at 50 years and stands older than 80 years (38). Variable-density yield tables-for stands of various stocking levels-provide better estimates of black spruce growth than normal and empirical yield tables in Ontario (10). They show that both site and stocking influence tree size and volume production. Good sites can grow larger trees than poor sites, whereas stocking has an adverse effect on average d.b.h. and no effect on average height. Merchantable volume, however, increases with stocking except on poor sites (table 1). Variable-density yield tables are also available for black spruce stands in Minnesota (39). Normal yield tables show that rotation age increases as site quality decreases. They also show that the corresponding merchantable volume and mean annual increment decrease greatly from good to poor sites. Averages for black spruce stands of three site classes in the boreal forest of Canada (5, p. 50,91,155,186) are as follows: Rotation age is the age at which the mean annual increment of merchantable volume culminates and hence yields the most material per unit area per annum. Little is known about the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands, but they apparently grow more slowly and have lower volumes than even-aged stands (17). Black spruce plantations reach heights of 1.5 to 4.0 m (5 to 13 ft) 10 years after planting (2,34). A 40-year-old plantation in Minnesota, planted at a 1.2- by 1.2-m (4- by 4-ft) spacing, was 13.3 m (43.6 ft) tall and had a basal area of 32.8 m²/ha (143 ft²/acre) (43). On rich sites in New Brunswick, extensive fast-growing plantations of black spruce have been established for 45-year rotations because the species has good potential height growth and is resistant to spruce budworm. In experimental studies, fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus generally results in increased growth in 60- to 90-year-old stands on upland boreal sites (48). The best response to fertilization apparently occurs in stands of low vigor (33,53). For example, fertilization (with nitrogen and phosphorus combined) may convert some marginally nonproductive muskeg stands of black spruce into commercial forest stands (1). Benefits from fertilization will probably be greatest in thinned stands (51). Drainage may increase the growth and yield of black spruce, but maximum response on peatlands and other wet sites will probably also require fertilization and (in dense stands) thinning. Full-tree harvesting will probably not reduce future productivity, except on sites of marginal fertility (52). Rooting Habit- Although some black spruce roots may penetrate to 60 cm (24 in), most spread laterally at the moss-humus interface. The bulk of the root biomass is in the upper 20 cm (8 in) of the organic horizons. In areas with rapidly accumulating organic layers, several sets of progressively younger roots may develop adventitiously. These new roots may grow as fast as 1 m (3 ft) per year and as much as 4.6 m (15 ft) in 8 to 9 years (2). Reaction to Competition- Black spruce is classed as tolerant of shade but is less tolerant than balsam fir and northern white-cedar, two common competitors in the eastern part of its range. Seedlings (and apparently layerings) develop in as little as 10 percent of full light intensity, but survival and growth are much better in the open (12). The maximum overstory basal area that can be tolerated without serious loss of seedling vigor is probably 9 to 11 m²/ha (40 to 50 ft²/acre). Aerial spraying of selective herbicides such as 2, 4-D usually results in effective release of black spruce in brushy stands (26,50). Released trees, however, apparently do not increase growth for about 2 years, and complete release can result in winter drying. Applying pellets of the nonselective herbicide picloram to speckled alder clumps seems to control regrowth longer than 2,4-D but can damage associated black spruce even on well-drained soils (40). Although quite expensive, recently introduced selective herbicides such as glyphosate and hexazinone are also registered for release of spruce. Directions on all herbicide labels should be followed carefully and pertinent precautions heeded. In spruce-fir stands, mature black spruce apparently responds better to release than white spruce and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa); its diameter increment increases by several times (9). Many intermediate and suppressed black spruce in swamp stands, however, die after heavy cutting (21). Black spruce has less ability than white spruce to overcome stagnation in even-aged stands because it develops a smaller range of crown classes. Heavy thinning in dense, middle-aged stands increases diameter increment but often decreases volume increment, probably because the site is not fully utilized (47). Black spruce is often a postfire pioneer on both uplands and peatlands, and fire usually results in the immediate reestablishment of black spruce as long as a seed source is available. Black spruce often dominates fire-prone areas, such as upland ridges, because it produces seed at an early age (20). It also becomes dominant on poor peatland (bog) sites where it has little competition. Tamarack and black spruce are the first trees to invade the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs. Postfire stands of black spruce are generally even aged. Uneven- to all-aged stands are almost absent in virgin forests because wildfires have been frequent and extensive enough to prevent their development on most sites. Such stands are common on bogs and muskegs, however, where the average interval between fires is probably longer than on uplands. Closed stands that escape fire for more than 100 years usually become uneven aged when black spruce layerings fill the gaps created by deterioration of the overstory (17). Black spruce grows more slowly than many of the trees and shrubs with which it is associated. Thus, it encounters substantial competition where these species are abundant, particularly when they reproduce from sprouts or suckers rather than from seed. Black spruce is fairly common as an understory tree in jack pine and lodgepole pine stands on dry sites, and succeeds the pines in the absence of fire or harvesting (12). Various mixtures of black spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir-plus northern white-cedar south of the boreal forest-eventually form the main stand on most well-drained sites supporting quaking aspen, paper birch, or balsam poplar. On the better peatland sites, black spruce is often overtopped by quaking aspen, paper birch, tamarack, black ash, or red maple for many years before it becomes dominant. Over much of its range, it is eventually succeeded by balsam fir and, to a lesser extent, northern white-cedar if undisturbed by fire (17). Black spruce does not compete successfully with balsam fir, northern white-cedar, red maple, balsam poplar, and black ash after cutting in mixed stands on good peatland sites (12). Similarly, harvesting or other disturbances on well-drained sites often lead to high proportions of balsam fir, paper birch, quaking aspen, and balsam poplar, or shrubs (50). Speckled alder is a strong competitor following harvesting on good peatland sites. The spruce, however, is generally able to grow through the alder canopy after several years (50). In Newfoundland and parts of Quebec, there has been extensive conversion of black spruce stands to heathland, dominated by lambkill and Labrador-tea, following repeated fires. Clearcutting in strips or patches is generally considered to be the best silvicultural system for managing black spruce (21,26,50). Satisfactory reestablishment of black spruce after clearcutting, however, requires an adequate source of reproduction and often some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal. Uneven- or all-aged management is best applied on poor sites where stands are windfirm. and have abundant layering (27). Damaging Agents- Eastern dwarfmistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) is a destructive disease of black spruce in the Lake States and eastern Canada, but it appears less often in the West and is completely absent in northwestern Canada and Alaska (18). In most areas, infection by mistletoe results in reduced vigor, clumped branches (witches' brooms), and deformed trees; but in some stands it may kill many trees. Successful control is possible by incorporating control methods in the silvicultural management (37). Several rusts of the genus Chrysomyxa infect both the buds and needles of black spruce. The infection usually remains at low levels but occasionally becomes epidemic and causes defoliation, reduced vigor, and even death of seedlings, saplings, and trees. The cone rust (Chrysomyxa pirolata) often results in greatly reduced seed production but does not kill the tree. Other diseases of black spruce include a needle cast fungus (Lophodermium spp.), which may cause defoliation and death in local areas; a yellow rust witches' broom (Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli); and a snow blight (Lophophacidium hyperboreum), which may cause extensive damage to black spruce growing in nurseries or young regeneration in the field. White pocket rots of roots and stems, most commonly Inonotus tomentosus, occur in black spruce and may cause significant damage in some upland stands (4,54). The spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is one of the insects most damaging to black spruce, even though black spruce is less susceptible than red spruce (Picea rubens), white spruce, and balsam fir. Budworm defoliation for several years in succession may result in moderate to severe mortality. The budworm and several other insects often cause serious damage to the flowers or cones, resulting in reduced seed crops (50). The European spruce sawfly (Diprion hercyniae) is an important pest in eastern Canada but has not invaded western portions of the range. The yellowheaded spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis) and greenheaded spruce sawfly (P. dimmockii) occasionally defoliate black spruce but seldom cause serious damage over large areas. Occasionally, a buildup in populations of the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) in white spruce leads to invasion and death of black spruce, usually where the two species are growing together. The spruce bud midge (Rhabdophaga swainei) may affect height growth in black spruce under some conditions (7). Monochamus wood borers have been known to kill considerable numbers of trees in areas adjacent to strip cuts as a result of initial buildup of populations in logging slash (50). Snowshoe hare may cause extensive damage to seedlings and saplings when populations of hare are high. Red squirrels gather cones in large quantities and give a peculiar clumped appearance to the top of the tree. Squirrels and microtines may consume a large percentage of the seed supply in some areas during poor seed years. Black spruce tops are often broken at a height of 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft) by snow and ice. In Alaska, one storm in 1967-68 broke 28 percent of the stems in a 160-year-old black spruce stand (46). Windthrow and breakage are two of the principal causes of mortality in black spruce stands in the Lake States; they must be considered when planning for harvesting black spruce stands. Black spruce is easily killed by both ground and crown fires. It generally rates high in fire hazard, although many peatland stands have a low risk except during very dry periods (26). Black spruce growing in peatlands is especially susceptible to changes in the water table, which sometimes occur naturally as the result of damming of small streams by beavers, but also result from increased or impeded drainage caused by road construction.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,14,1
"Black spruce usually grows on wet organic soils, but productive stands are found on a variety of soil types from deep humus through clays, loams, sands, coarse till, boulder pavements, and shallow soil mantles over bedrock. In the Lake States and adjacent Canadian provinces, it grows on soils of the order Histosols: peat bogs and swamps that have formed on old glacial lakebeds and in muck-filled seepages on peat deposits that range in thickness from 0.5 to 6 m (20 in to 20 ft). The most productive black spruce stands are on dark brown to blackish peats, which usually have a considerable amount of decayed woody material. Stands of low productivity are usually found on thick deposits of partially decomposed sphagnum peat. In central Canada, upland stands tend to be of higher quality than the lowland peat stands. Here, podzolic soils of the order Spodosols and gley soils of the order Inceptisols are common on gentle slopes underlain by clay-loam or clays that have been derived from glacial tills. Many of these clay soils are derived from calcareous materials and are neutral to slightly alkaline in the B or C horizons. The most productive black spruce stands are found on the better drained sites such as sandy glacial deposits, river terraces, and outwash plains of the order Entisols, usually in association with hardwood species. In the north, black spruce sites are commonly underlain by permafrost (perennially frozen soils). Black spruce seems to be the tree species best adapted to growing on permafrost soils because of its shallow rooting habit. Often the annual thaw depth (active zone) may be as little as 40 cm (16 in). In northwestern Canada, black spruce often grows in alternating organic and mineral soil layers, on hummock-like mounds that overlie the permafrost (57). In central Alaska, black spruce is found on permafrost sites of shallow wind-deposited loess and on old river terraces. At tree line, it is often found on shallow, poorly developed mineral soils. On most black spruce sites on permafrost, wildfire results in a temporary increase in the thaw depth. Black spruce is found from sea level in eastern and northern Canada and western Alaska to 1830 m (6,000 ft) in northern Alberta. It is considered to be a tree of interior lowlands, however, and usually grows at between 150 and 760 m (500 and 2,500 ft). In the mountains of Alaska, Yukon Territory, and Northwest Territories, it is often the tree line species at elevations of 300 to 1220 m (1,000 to 4,000 ft). Local topography and drainage seem to be more important than elevation in determining the range of black spruce.",Soils and Topography,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,15,1
"The principal commercial use of black spruce both in Canada and the United States is for making high quality pulp with balanced strength properties. It is also used for lumber, Christmas trees, and other products. Black spruce Christmas trees were harvested in considerable numbers from natural stands until fairly recently, especially on poor sites in Minnesota (26). Historically, black spruce has provided some highly specialized products, a few of which are still used occasionally: healing salves from spruce gum (exuded resin); beverages from twigs and needles; aromatic distillations from needles (42); and binding material (""wattape"")- from long, split roots-for birchbark canoes. The spruce grouse depends mainly on black spruce stands for food and cover (26). Birds with relatively high densities in black spruce stands during the summer include the ruby-crowned kinglet, magnolia warbler, Cape May warbler, and ovenbird. Birds such as the pine grosbeak, pine siskin, and crossbills commonly feed on black spruce seed.",Special Uses,Black Spruce,picea,mariana,conifer,16,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- Black tupelo is polygamo-dioecious and flowers from April through June. The fruit of black tupelo ripens in September and October and drops from September through November. The flowers are small and greenish white, home singly or in capitate clusters. The fruit, an oblong drupe, is about 13 mm (0.5 in) long and is blue-black; the pit is indistinctly ribbed (2). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production in black tupelo is highly variable. Seeds are disseminated by gravity, animals, and birds (2). Seedling Development- Under natural conditions, seeds overwinter on cool moist soil and germinate in the spring. Germination is epigeal (2). Black tupelo requires nearly full light for optimum development. In a mature hardwood forest on a good site in Tennessee, 830 black tupelo/ha (337/acre) were well distributed over a 24/ha (60/acre) area. Two years following clearcutting there were 1,880 black tupelo/ha (760/acre) less than 1.37 m (4.5 ft) in height, and 375/ha (150/acre) more than 1.37 rn (4.5 ft) tall. In four good young hardwood stands in northern Alabama, black tupelo ranged from 1,790 to 2,965 stems/ha (725 to 1,200/acre) 5 or 6 years after clearcutting. When three of the areas were burned as part of a controlled experiment, the number of small tupelo per hectare approximately doubled the first year; the number of stems taller than 1.37 m (4.5 ft) decreased by about 50 percent (5). Vegetative Reproduction- Smaller black tupelo stumps sprout readily and larger stumps sprout occasionally. Root suckering can occur in profusion around some trees. Layering has been used to produce black tupelo stock.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Tupelo,nyssa,silvatica,hardwood,13,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The minute greenish-white flowers appear in the spring with the leaves, usually in late April in South Carolina. Flowers are polygamo-dioecious, or swamp tupelo may bear staminate and pistillate flowers on separate trees (22). Insects, primarily bees, are the major pollinating vector, but pollen is also spread by wind. The fruit, a drupe, changes from green to a dark blue as it ripens, usually in early November in South Carolina. Seed Production and Dissemination- Most years swamp tupelo is a prolific seed producer. Over a 4-year period in a 90-year-old stand in South Carolina seed production was as follows: Seed viability, which averaged 60 percent, increased as the season progressed. The seed crop failure in 1964 was probably the result of a late frost. In South Carolina seedfall begins in early September (6). About 50 percent of the seeds are shed from late October through November. By early December, seedfall is 90 to 95 percent complete. Dissemination is fairly uniform over an entire area. The principal dissemination agents are gravity and birds, mostly robins. The birds consume the fleshy fruits and the seeds are passed through the digestive tract. In southern Carolina, the arrival of large flocks of migratory robins often coincides with peak ripening. Under these conditions birds can disseminate about 55 percent of the total seed crop. These seeds are evenly distributed and have an average viability of 44 percent. Unlike those of water tupelo, fruits of swamp tupelo do not float. Seedling Development- The seeds normally overwinter and germinate the following spring. Germination is epigeal (22). It does not take place under water, but submerged seeds germinate once the water subsides below the soil surface (7). Germination is rapid in moist, drained conditions at 21° C (70° F) and higher. After germination, seedlings must grow rapidly to keep the apex and leaves above water, because prolonged submergence during active growth will kill them. Submergence during the dormant season, however, has no adverse effect. Swamp tupelo types are stable and usually regenerate following harvest, although species such as willow (Salix spp.) may temporarily dominate some cutover sites (21). Initial seedling establishment is related to seed production, but variation in water table is more important in most years. Environmental conditions under an overstory of 75 to 620 trees per hectare (30 to 250/acre) are favorable for germination and early growth (5). Thus, the shelterwood method can be used to establish seedlings. Regeneration can also be accomplished by clearcutting if it is done following a good seedfall or if, as often happens, advanced reproduction is already established. Vegetative Reproduction- Stump sprouting is very common following logging (4,12,19). Sprouts arise from suppressed buds and are concentrated near the top of the stump. High stumps, the normal condition since trees are usually cut above the butt swell, have many more sprouts than low-cut stumps. Harvesting trees just before the growing season can increase the growth rate of sprouts. Stump sprouts can produce seed at 2 years of age. Thus, if the seed crop fails or if unfavorable water conditions prevent a good crop of seedlings from becoming established, sprouts can provide a seed source. However, sprout growth is often so rapid and profuse that all competing vegetation, including natural or planted seedlings, is soon overtopped. Whether or not these sprouts develop into good quality stands is not known.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Tupelo,nyssa,silvatica,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Black tupelo can achieve heights of 36 in (120 ft) and diameters up to 122 cm (48 in) at breast height on the most favorable sites. Diameter growth on medium sites where the tree has good stand position may reach 10 to 20 cm (4 to 5 in) in 10 years. On poorer sites or where the tree is crowded, diameter and height growth can be very slow (7). Black tupelo growing on good sites that have not been burned can produce veneer logs. Most logs suitable for veneer are about 50 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. Black tupelo produces a pronounced ribbon figure and is often quarter sliced (6). The light, uniform-textured wood of tupelo makes excellent containers. Much of the merchantable upland black tupelo is used for crossties and pallets. A majority of stems are not considered desirable growing stock and are often left standing following commercial timber sales. These stems are usually moderately easy to control with herbicides. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Black tupelo is usually found in mixture with other species. It is classed as tolerant of shade. Only rarely does it attain a dominant crown position within its age group; it usually occupies an intermediate crown position on most sites. Some intermediate black tupelo stems respond favorably to release from overtopping vegetation. Seedlings grow slowly under a fully stocked stand. When the canopy is removed, about 25 percent or more can be expected to respond with relatively rapid height growth. Large numbers of new seedlings can become established at the time of cutting. Damaging Agents- Black tupelo, particularly where it grows on dry sites, is often affected by fire. Hot fires can cause serious mortality and cull. Fire scars often serve as entry courts for large numbers of heart rot fungi. Ten of 25 black tupelo samples in a study of the central hardwood region had heart rot (1). The tupelo leafminer (Antispila nysaefoliella) and the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) attack the tupelos.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Tupelo,nyssa,silvatica,hardwood,14,0
"Growth and Yield- On good sites swamp tupelo can attain heights of 37 m (120 ft) and diameters exceeding 122 cm (48 in) (2). Average stand d.b.h. at age 85 is 25 cm (10 in) (1). The average height of dominants at different ages is as follows: Pure, even-aged stands produce an average of 9 m³/ha (1 cord/acre) per year through age 85. Representative normal yields by age and site index are given in table 1. Rooting Habit- Swamp tupelo normally develops a taproot and has a swollen base to the mean height of the growing season water level. Water roots, which develop under flooded conditions, help support the tree and capture nutrients. These specialized roots tolerate high carbon dioxide concentrations, oxidize the rhizosphere, and carry on anaerobic respiration. Thus, they are the key to the species ability to thrive under flooded conditions (14,15). Reaction to Competition- Swamp tupelo is classed as intolerant of shade and is best suited to even-age management (18,21). Although seedlings become established under an existing stand they do not develop unless released. Swamp tupelo grows well in stands with relatively high basal areas of 39 to 46 m²/ha (170 to 200 ft² /acre). Many harvested sites develop sapling densities far in excess of optimum. Natural thinning in these overstocked stands is quite slow and, although individual trees respond to thinning, difficult access and damage to sites during logging operations, coupled with low returns, makes thinning undesirable. Damaging Agents- Swamp tupelo sites are normally quite wet, but during extended drought they do dry out. If the peat that accumulates on many of the sites becomes dry enough to bum, severe fires can cause high mortality and cull in the stand (3). The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) defoliates trees, reducing growth. Severe damage can result in dieback and mortality (23). Various woodboring insects cause significant degrade in swamp tupelo veneer logs. Tupelo lesion caused by Fusarium solani develops on the stem, killing the cambium, which causes swelling and roughened bark (2). Although this is seldom lethal it can cause significant degrade in logs. Fomes spp., Polyporus spp., Daedalea ambigua, Hydnum erinaceum, Lentinus tigrinus, and Pleurotus ostreatus fungi all cause heartrot in swamp tupelo. Swamp tupelo is very susceptible to sapsucker injury and is readily damaged by salt spray. Sulfate-enriched water can cause seedling mortality (20).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Tupelo,nyssa,silvatica,hardwood,14,0

In the uplands it grows best on the loams and clay loams of lower slopes and coves. When found on drier upper slopes and ridges, it is seldom of log size or quality (8).

"Swamp tupelo grows on a variety of wet bottomland soils including organic mucks, heavy clays, and wet sands. It occurs mainly on soils in the orders Ultisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols. Swamp tupelo not only tolerates flooding but actually thrives under those conditions (16). It is seldom found on sites that are not inundated much of the growing season. Swamp tupelo grows in headwater swamps, strands, ponds, river bottoms, bays, estuaries, and low coves. Normally it does not grow in the deeper parts of swamps or overflow river bottoms. The type of water regime is more important to growth of swamp tupelo than the soil type (11). Best growth is achieved on sites where the soil is continuously saturated with very shallow moving water. Growth can be reduced as much as 50 percent when the water is stagnant, as in ponds.

"Black walnut grows in many of the mixed mesophytic forests but is seldom abundant (43). Usually it is found scattered among other trees; pure stands are rare, small, and usually located on the forest edge. Black walnut is a common associate in five forest cover types (16): Sugar Maple (Society of American Foresters Type 27) in the central hardwood zone and the Appalachian highlands, Yellow-Poplar (Type 57) at lower elevations of the Appalachians, Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 59) at lower elevations, Beech-Sugar Maple (Type 60) in the Midwest, and Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62) in southern Ontario washboard swamps where high and low ground intermingle. It is also found as an occasional associated species in four cover types: Chestnut Oak (Type 44), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), Northern Red Oak (Type 55) on moist sites, and Sassafras-Persimmon (Type 64) in older stands. Chief associated species include yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), basswood (Tilia americana), beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar Maple (Acer saccharum), oaks Quercus spp.), and hickories (Carya spp.). Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with American elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and boxelder (Acer negundo), or with basswood and red oak Quercus rubra) on lower slopes and other favorable sites (10). No universal vegetative indicator of a good walnut site is known, but the presence of Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus) seems to indicate such a site (10,43). In general, where yellow-poplar, white ash, red oak, basswood, sugar maple, or slippery elm (Ulmus rubra) grow well, black walnut thrives also. An antagonism between black walnut and many other plants growing within its root zone has been recognized and is attributed to juglone, a toxic substance found in the leaves, bark, nut husks, and roots of walnut trees (32,42). Some tree species apparently are immune, but others, such as paper birch (Betula Papyrifera), red pine (Pinus resinosa), white pine (P. strobus), Scotch pine (P. sylvestris), and apple (Malus spp.), reportedly are sensitive. Tomatoes are especially susceptible. In a laboratory study, juglone at high concentrations was lethal to four coniferous species, but seedling growth was actually promoted when exposed to minute concentrations (19). Although tomatoes are especially susceptible to juglone, black walnut trees may be compatible with some agricultural crops and might even improve the growth of bluegrass (Poa spp.).",Associated Forest Cover,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,1,0
"The growing season within the range of black walnut ranges from 140 days in the north to 280 days in western Florida (10,43).

Mean annual temperatures range from about 7° C (45° F) in the north to 19° C (67° F) in the south. Temperatures as low as -43° C (-45° F) have occurred where walnut grows, but few races of black walnut can tolerate such low temperature.

"Wright (54) has pointed out that species that can cross within a genus usually have distinct (often adjacent) ranges, while species that occupy the same sites in the same regions develop barriers to hybridization. Juglans seems to follow this pattern; J. nigra and J. cinerea often grow together but apparently never cross naturally, while all other walnut species (at least in the western hemisphere) are almost completely isolated. Thus, easy crossing might be expected among the morphologically similar North America Rhysocaryon walnuts. One example is the ""Royal"" hybrid between J.nigra and J. hindsii produced by Burbank in about 1888. This hybrid begins to bear viable seed by age 5 and produces exceptionally large nuts (50). The hybrids are vigorous and have been recommended for timber areas. Black walnut has been crossed with other species of Juglans in attempts to increase nut production, to produce a thin-shelled nut, or to produce a faster growing tree. Juglans can be divided into three sections: the black walnuts, the butternuts, and the Persian/Carpathians. A somatic chromosome number of 32 is consistent for all the species reported to date (18). Crossing between the black walnut and butternut sections is difficult or impossible. A cross between J. nigra and J. ailantifolia is the only one recognized between the black walnut and butternut sections. However, J. regia can hybridize with species in both the other sections, although the crosses are not always easy. Artificial hybridization is simple but time consuming. Each pollination may yield two or three nuts and a season's work only a few thousand nuts.",Hybrids,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,9,0
"Black walnut typically grows as scattered individual trees or in small groups throughout the central and eastern parts of the United States.

Its natural range extends from western Vermont and Massachusetts west through New York to southern Ontario, central Michigan, southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota and northeastern Nebraska; south to western Oklahoma and central Texas; excluding the Mississippi River Valley and Delta, it ranges east to northwestern Florida and Georgia (28,29). On the western fringe of its range in Kansas, walnut is fairly abundant and frequently makes up 50 percent or more of the basal area in stands of several hectares (21). -The native range of black walnut.",Native Range,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,11,0
"Black walnut contains great genetic variation for growth and survival, and an important part of this variation is related to geographic origin (8). Preliminary seed collection zones have been recommended (15). Geographic variation among stands is three to five times greater than local (within stands) variation for characteristics such as growth rate, dates of foliation and leaf drop, twig maturation, and degree of winter dieback (17). Genetic gains can be made through selection within a designated seed collection zone. Generally, trees from seed collected south of the planting site grow as fast or faster in height and diameter than trees from local or northern sources (7,9). Both duration and rate of growth are responsible for the growth differences. In 1969, trees from Mississippi and Texas seed sources planted in a southern Illinois plantation grew in height for 134 days compared to 93 days for trees from northern Illinois and Iowa sources (5). On the average, height growth continued 1 day longer for every 24 miles south of the planting site that seed was collected (6). Duration of diameter growth was less closely related. However, trees of southern origin grew fastest. Flowering phenology, seed weight, kernel percent, nut crackability, foliage characteristics, grafting and budding compatibility, rooting capacity of layered trees in stool beds, autumn leaf retention, cold resistance, and growth rates vary widely among black walnut families (17). More than 400 black walnut cultivars have been named and released during the past century. Twenty of the most popular, including origin and nut evaluations, are listed by Funk (18). Three timber-type walnut clones chosen for outstanding straightness, anthracnose resistance, or late spring foliation have been patented by Purdue University.",Population Differences,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Depending on latitude, black walnut flowers generally begin to appear about mid-April in the South and progressively later until early June in the northern part of the natural range. Flowering and leafing out occur at approximately the same time and always early enough for possible damage by late spring frosts (18,27). Walnut is monoecious; male flowers, which are slender catkins, develop from axillary buds on the previous year's outer nodes, while female flowers occur in short terminal spikes, ranging from a few to many, home on the current year's shoots. Flowering is dichogamous, and protogyny (the female flowers appearing first) is more common than protandry (male flowers appearing first) (33,34). Because of its dichogamous flowering habit, self-pollination is unlikely. However, individual trees usually are not self-sterile; if they are not pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds (3). Fertilization follows 2 to 5 days after pollination, succeeded by development of the husk, the shell, and finally by the seed itself (18). Seed Production and Dissemination- The large edible nut ripens in September or October of the same year and drops shortly after the leaves fall. Good seed crops are produced irregularly, perhaps twice in 5 years. Open-grown trees may produce some seed when only 4 to 6 years old, but large seed crops do not occur until the trees are 20 to 30 years old (28). For example, at 10 years of age, a midwest plantation produced 28 kg of hulled nuts per hectare (25 lbs/acre), and by age 12 production had increased to 112 kg/ha (100 lb/acre). Best seed production begins when the trees are about 30 years old and continues for another 100 years. Seed is disseminated only short distances by gravity and animals. In a Missouri study, seed production of trees about 28 years old and 19.3 cm (7.6 in) in d.b.h. was nearly doubled by release and fertilization (40). Trees released but not fertilized produced 13 percent more nuts than nonreleased trees. Stratification for 90 to 120 days is required for optimum seed germination but the necessity and duration of stratification may vary by seed source (46). In Canada, 69 to 81 percent of nuts stratified 19 months germinated within 3 weeks of seeding, while 10 to 25 percent of nuts stratified 7 months germinated after 12 weeks (48). When nuts that had not germinated after 12 weeks in the seedbed following 7 months stratification were stratified for an additional 9 months, 81 percent germinated within 3 weeks. Many of the nuts stratified for 31 months germinated while in storage. Seedling Development- Germination is hypogeal (46). Young black walnut seedlings are intolerant of shade and are seldom found under dense tree canopies. Regeneration develops primarily from seed that squirrels bury and fail to recover. Normal winter temperatures usually cause the buried seeds to break dormancy the following spring, but germination is sometimes delayed until the second year. Seedlings emerge in April or May the first or second spring after the seed is planted (46). On deep, rich, moist soils in coves or well-drained bottom land, seedlings may grow 91 cm (36 in) the first year and even more the second growing season. Although black walnut does not make as rapid height growth as yellow-poplar and white ash on good sites, it generally surpasses the oaks. In eastern Nebraska, near the western edge of its range, walnut made much better height growth than oaks or basswood on a prairie site (10). Walnut developed an excellent root system and was several times taller than the other tree species. Height growth begins slowly in the spring, reaches a peak rate in late April and May, and is complete by the middle of July or the first of August. Black walnut loses its leaves somewhat earlier than other trees and has a growing period of from 115 to 135 days (10). Because of its large taproot, planted walnut seedlings typically survive well. However, they require weed control during the first 2 or 3 years to grow well (26). Vegetative Reproduction- If small black walnut trees are cut or killed back by fire, the stumps usually sprout. Sprouts originating near the root collar generally are free from defect but sprouts originating high on older stumps often develop heart rot or other decay from the parent stump. Within the last few years the success of grafting and budding of walnut has increased substantially. From 80 to 100 percent success has been achieved by three grafting methods done in the greenhouse and growth chamber (35). In the field the success rate for inlay grafting, the best method tested, ranged from 33 to 83 percent. A consistent field survival of 70 to 90 percent for the outplantings of grafted stock is predicted if tested procedures are followed (4). Black walnut is compatible with several other Juglans species, either as a root stock or scion (22).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- On the best sites, young black walnut trees may grow 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in) in height per year (28). The best tree in a southern Indiana plantation at age 7 was 11.9 cm (4.7 in) d.b.h. and 7.6 in (25 ft) in height (9). In a southern Illinois plantation (site index 24.4 m or 80 ft at base age 50 years), the best tree was 21 cm (8.3 in) d.b.h. and 12 m (40 ft) tall at age 14 (1). However, the average size tree in the plantation was 12 cm (4.8 in) d.b.h. and 7 m (24 ft) tall. Even on less favorable sites (site index 21.3 m or 70 ft), trees reach heights of 12 to 15 rn (40 to 50 ft) and diameters of 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) in 20 years (28). In contrast, diameter growth of black walnut planted on Kansas strip mine spoil banks averaged only 6 mm (0.25 in) per year and height growth averaged only 33.5 cm (13.2 in) per year during the first 10 to 12 years (10). On Illinois spoil banks trees grew best on the lower slopes, on areas formed from limestone parent material and containing a high percentage of fine soil, or if underplanted with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). In two 10-year-old southern Illinois plantations, walnut trees in mixture with autumn-olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), a nitrogen-fixing species, were 89 percent taller and 104 percent larger in diameter than walnut trees in pure walnut plots (41). In an Indiana study, 10 years after autumn-olive was interplanted into 2-year-old black walnut, the walnut in the interplanted plots were 2.6 rn (8.4 ft) taller than those in the pure plots (14). Mature black walnut trees on good sites may reach 30 to 37 m (100 to 120 ft) in height and 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 in) in d.b.h. (28). Trees 40 m (130 ft) tall and more than 244 cm (96 in) in d.b.h. have been reported in Wisconsin. In Indiana, black walnut trees were 46 m (150 ft) tall and 183 cm (72 in) in d.b.h. on the most favorable sites (43). Research and experience indicate that with proper care it may be possible to produce 41-cm (16-in) saw logs in 30 to 35 years, and by planting on good sites it may be possible to produce 51 cm (20 in) veneer logs in 40 to 50 years. By applying some basic cultural practices, such as release and pruning, to established trees, growth and quality can be greatly increased in only a few years. Board-foot volume growth rate was correlated with site quality in midwestern plantations. According to Kellogg's yield tables (23), predicted yield for site index 21.3 rn (70 ft) at age 75 is 10 times that of site index 12.2 m (40 ft), and yields for site index 18.3 m (60 ft) are twice those for site index 15.2 m (50 ft). The yield tables also show that periodic annual growth rate is not constant: maximum growth occurs between ages 40 and 50 years on the better sites. Rooting Habit- The root system of mature black walnut has been described as combining the deep taproot of more xeric trees, such as the oaks, with the strong laterals characteristic of more mesic ones, such as maple. The rooting configuration of individual trees depends on soil texture and moisture conditions (47). The root system is deep and wide spreading, with a definite taproot, at least in early life. The taproot of a 9-year-old walnut tree excavated from an Indiana plantation was 2.3 rn (7.5 ft) long and the lateral roots extended more than 2.4 m (8 ft) from the taproot (11). One-year-old walnut seedlings lifted from nursery seedbeds have well-developed taproots (51). The mass of fibrous roots varies with the soil type; the more fibrous-rooted seedlings develop in the more sandy-textured soils. Early growth of the seedling root system is rapid. Vertical taproot extension during the first growing season is great, especially on drier soils. One researcher reported a taproot penetration of more than 1.2 rn (4 ft) for 1-year-old walnut seedlings on a prairie silt loam soil. Another reported 64 to 69 cm (25 to 27 in) for 1-year-old walnut on a more moist site (47). In the second year of root growth, the taproot continues to extend and many lateral roots develop. The depth of walnut lateral roots may vary in response to root competition with its associates. In one study, lateral roots of walnut occupied a much shallower position in pure walnut stands than in mixed walnut-ash stands. This was explained by theorizing that the ash, having a strongly developed surface root system, forced the walnut roots into deeper soil layers. Root competition with Norway maple (Acer platanoides), on the other hand, was not as intense (47). Black walnut is moderately tolerant of flooding. Mature trees are generally killed after 90 days of continuous inundation during the growing season, although some individuals may survive for 150 days or more. Black walnut is more flood-tolerant than black cherry, shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), basswood, and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata) (47). The initial root form of black walnut, with its rapidly growing juvenile taproot and wide spreading laterals, is characteristic of species that grow on deep, fine-textured soils in regions with well-distributed summer rains. Such soils maintain a fairly uniform available water content to considerable depth, and walnut growing on these soils are able to draw their moisture and nutrients largely from the more fertile shallow soil while still being able to rely on the deeper soil layers for survival during times of drought. Black walnut forms endomycorrhizae of the vesicular-arbuscular type. One study revealed that 100 percent of the walnut seedlings grown in a southern Michigan nursery had endomycorrhizae, but seedlings grown in a southern Indiana nursery had no mycorrhizae. A recent study shows that several Glomus species form a symbiotic relation with black walnut seedlings. Some Glomus, species and combinations of species increased growth of black walnut (36). Reaction to Competition- Black walnut is classed as intolerant of shade (2). In mixed forest stands it must be dominant or codominant to survive, although it has survived and grown in the light shade of black locust. In a mixed hardwood stand in Indiana, pole-size black walnut responded to crown release by more than doubling diameter growth over a 10-year period (39,40). Trees only partially released grew about 50 percent more than unreleased trees. Controlling understory growth had little effect on growth of the walnut trees. Following release, dominant and codominant trees continue to grow more rapidly than those in intermediate or suppressed crown classes, but strong intermediates often respond most to release (in terms of growth rate increase). A walnut tree should be considered for release if it is healthy, has a bole with potential to make a veneer or high quality saw log, and is small enough that it can reasonably be left for at least 10 more years. To be effective, release must be thorough. A rule of thumb is that at least threefourths of the crown of the released tree should be at least 1.5 m (5 ft) from the crowns of adjacent trees 60 to 100 percent as tall, and at least 3 m (10 ft) from the crowns of taller trees. Subsequent releases will be required at intervals of 6 to 10 years to maintain free growing space. Some bole sprouting can be expected on forest-grown trees that are released for the first time. Bole sprouts developed on almost half of the unreleased trees and on almost two-thirds of the released trees during an Indiana study (39). Sprouts were more numerous on the unreleased trees (16.1 sprouts per tree) than on the partially (12.2 sprouts per tree) and completely released trees (9.2 sprouts per tree), but the sprouts were much larger on the released trees. The intermediate and suppressed trees had more sprouts than dominant or codominate trees. Most of the bole sprouts were above the butt log, and more were on the south side than on the north side of the trees. Control of competing vegetation is especially important in new plantations. In an Indiana study, walnut seedlings established on formerly cultivated fields and given 3 years of weed control were 100 cm (39 in) taller at 10 years of age, and 15 mm (0.6 in) larger d.b.h. than trees given 2 years of control (53). Trees with vegetation controlled 2 years were 40 cm (15.7 in) taller and 5 mm (0.2 in) larger in diameter than those where weeds were controlled only 1 year. Broadcast weed control is neither necessary nor desirable because it aggravates erosion problems. In a southern Illinois experiment, seventh-year survival of black walnut planted on a cleared forest site was 94 to 99 percent regardless of weed control treatment (25). The young trees grew better, however, when all vegetation or only forbs and grasses were controlled than when only woody vegetation was controlled or when no vegetation control was used. Biennial control was no better than triennial, but annual control was superior. When only woody vegetation was controlled, frequency of treatment had no effect. Pruning lateral branches helps to produce knot-free wood under open growing conditions that would normally permit most of the lower branches to persist. The objective of pruning is to produce a clear bole while minimizing damage to the tree and growth loss. When needed, pruning should be begun early in the life of the tree and continued as needed. To minimize damage and promote rapid healing, branches should be pruned before they are 5 cm (2 in) d.b.h. A neat, clean cut should be made, being careful not to be cut into the branch collar (44). Ring shakes and dark bands of discolored wood were associated with 14 of 17 stubs that were ""flush cut"" (branch collar removed) 13 years earlier. Pruning young trees eliminates these problems, but if older trees are pruned, care must be taken not to remove the branch collars that form around the bases of dying and dead branches. When trees are pruned during the dormant season (early spring just before the leaves appear is best), wounds tend to heal more rapidly and completely and sprouts from dormant buds near the wound are less likely to develop. If sprouts do develop, they should be removed promptly. No more than 25 percent of the live crown should be released in a single year, and at least 50 percent of the total tree height should be maintained in live crown (10). Damaging Agents- Black walnut is damaged by a number of insects. In southern Illinois more than 300 insect species were found on black walnut (49). Even though many insects feed on black walnut, only a few are considered serious pests. Two of the most common defoliating insects are the walnut caterpillar (Datana integerrima) and the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea). They are commonly found eating the leaves beginning in midsummer and continuing until September. Important boring insects are the ambrosia beetle (Xylosandrus germanus), which may introduce a Fusarium fungus into the tree, causing dieback and resprouting from the base of the tree; the flatheaded apple tree borer (Chrysobothris femorata), which feeds in the phloem and outer sapwood area as larvae and on the foliage as adults; the walnut curculio (Conotrachelus retentus), which damages developing nuts when the larvae bore into them and cause great losses during the so-called ""June drop"" of walnuts; and the walnut shoot moth (Acrobasis demotella), which damages the terminal buds in early spring when the larvae bore into the still unexpanded bud, causing multiple forks and crooks in the main stem. The pecan leaf casebearer (Acrobasis juglandis) is closely related to the walnut shoot moth but is a much less damaging pest of black walnut. Important sucking insects are aphids or plant lice (Monellia spp. and Monelliopsis spp.), which suck the juices from leaves and often deposit a sticky substance called ""honey-dew"" on the leaf surface that may turn black and prevent photosynthesis; and the walnut lace bug (Corythucha juglandis), which causes damage when the adults and nymphs suck the sap from the lower surfaces of walnut leaflets. Black walnut is susceptible to only a few serious diseases, but their impact is significant. Two serious root rot diseases found in seedling nurseries are caused by the fungi Phytophthora citricola and Cylindrocladium spp. An important mold of stored seed and seedlings is associated with Penicillia and other normally saprophytic fungi (24). Walnut anthracnose, caused by the fungus Gnomonia leptostyla, is a leaf spot disease that begins during wet spring weather, although symptoms may not become visible until June or July (49). Another important foliage disease is target leafspot which is caused by the fungus Cristulariella pryamidalis and is responsible for premature defoliation (38). A newly discovered, serious leaf spot disease is caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella juglandis (24). Important stem diseases caused by fungi are the Fusarium cankers caused by several species of Fusarium and the perennial target canker (Nectria galligena) commonly known as Nectria canker (49). Cankers usually occur on the main stem where a branch broke off and left an open wound. Animals damage black walnut in several ways. Deer browse on buds and rub antlers against young trees. Mice and rabbits gnaw on the stems of young trees during the winter, and squirrels dig up and eat direct-seeded nuts and feed on green and mature nuts still on the trees. Perching birds break the terminal or new branches from the tree, and the yellow-bellied sapsucker drills holes through the bark during late winter or early spring (49). Some trees may be nearly girdled with peck holes. Decay, dieback, and frost also cause damage. At times dieback and frost damage may be extensive. Late spring frosts kill succulent new growth and thus reduce height growth and destroy desirable form. Late winter warming periods sometimes cause walnut trees to break dormancy prematurely, resulting in freezing injury to the stem tissue (13,37).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,14,0
"Black walnut is sensitive to soil conditions and develops best on deep, well-drained, nearly neutral soils that are generally moist and fertile (10). These soils are in the orders Alfisols and Entisols. Although an Ohio study indicated that site index for black walnut was not significantly related to pH values between 4.6 and 8.2, site index was highest on limestone derived soils even though some of the soils were acid. Walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam textured soils but also grows well on silty clay loam soils (31). Soils with these textures hold a large amount of water that is available to the tree during dry periods of the growing season. Internal drainage and depth to gravel are especially important site characteristics for black walnut. On well-drained soils, 76 cm (30 in) or more to mottling, 25-year-old trees were 6.6 cm (2.6 in) larger in d.b.h. than trees growing on imperfectly drained soils, 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in) to mottling. Twenty-five-year-old trees on deep soils, more than 102 cm (40 in) from surface to gravel, were 5.2 m (17 ft) taller and 6.4 cm (2.5 in) larger in d.b.h. than trees on shallow soils less than 102 cm (40 in) from surface to gravel (30). Walnut is common on limestone soils and grows especially well on deep loams, loess soils, and fertile alluvial deposits. It also grows well on good agricultural soils that do not have fragipans. Walnut grows slowly on wet bottom land and on sandy or dry ridges and slopes. Throughout its range, walnut generally reaches its greatest size and value along streams and on the lower portion of north- or east-facing slopes. This is particularly true near the limits of its natural range. In northeastern Kansas, site index on alluvial soils was 2.4 rn (8 ft) greater than on residual soils and 2.7 in (9 ft) greater on northeast than on southwest aspects (20).",Soils and Topography,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,15,0
"The best known use of black walnut is for its lumber and veneer. The wood is used for fine furniture of all kinds, interior paneling, specialty products, and gunstocks. The nuts of black walnut serve many purposes. The kernels provide food for wildlife and humans (45,52). Ground shells provide special products (12). During World War II, airplane pistons were cleaned with a ""nut shell"" blaster and this idea was carried into the auto industry; manufacturers used shells to deburr precision gears. Ground shell products are also used to clean jet engines, as additives to drilling mud for oil drilling operations, as filler in dynamite, as a nonslip agent in automobile tires, as an air-pressured propellant to strip paints, as a filter agent for scrubbers in smokestacks, and as a flourlike carrying agent in various insecticides.",Special Uses,Black Walnut,juglans,nigra,hardwood,16,0
"Black willow is the predominant species in Black Willow (Society of American Foresters Type 95), a temporary, pioneer forest cover type with excellent growth characteristics (1). It is an associated species in the following cover types: River Birch-Sycamore (Type 61), Cottonwood (Type 63), Sycamore-Sweetgum-American Elm (Type 94), Baldcypress (Type 101), Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102), Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103), and Cottonwood-Willow (Type 235). Other noteworthy tree associates are red maple (Acer rubrum), boxelder (A. negundo), red mulberry (Morus rubra), and water locust (Gleditsia aquatica). In the areas where willow develops best, swamp-privet (Forestiera acuminata), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), and water-elm (Planera aquatica) are the major noncommercial tree associates.

"The climate in which black willow grows best is characterized by an average rainfall of 1300 mm (51 in). Approximately 500 mm (20 in) of this occurs during the effective growing season, April through August. The average maximum temperature is 34° C (93° F) in the summer and 15° C (59° F) in the winter. In parts of its range, black willow survives extremes of 46° to -50° C (115° to -58° F). Geographic distribution appears to be independent of temperature (4,7).",Climate,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,2,0
"Population differences exist but the magnitude and distribution of the variation of specific characters awaits verification through analysis of provenance and progeny tests. Clonal differences in defoliation of black willow by the cottonwood leaf beetle were noted in experimental plots in Mississippi; feeding was also heavier on the male clones (6). In another study, black willows from two natural stands 160 km (100 mi) apart on the lower reaches of the Mississippi River had significantly different fiber lengths (8). One or more races of black willow are recognized as varieties by some authorities (3,9). Western black willow (Salix nigra var. vallicola Dudley) of Southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico was renamed as a species, Goodding willow (S. gooddingii Ball). Controversy over whether this is a separate species or a varietal species of black willow still goes on. Two other varieties have been named: S. nigra var. altissima Sarg. of the Texas gulf coast and S. nigra var. lindheimeri Schneid. of central Texas. Although the genus Salix is widely distributed and many species occupy sympatric ranges, natural hybrids apparently are not common (3). Putative hybrids are difficult to verify since the identity of one parent is often uncertain. The following willows hybridize with Salix nigra: Salix alba (S. x hankensonii Dode), S. amygdaloides (S. x glatfelteri Schneid.), S. bonplandiana, S. caroliniana, S. lucida (S. x schneideri Boivan), and S. sericea.",Genetics,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,7,0
"Black willow is found throughout the Eastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada and Mexico. The range extends from southern New Brunswick and central Maine west in Quebec, southern Ontario, and central Michigan to southeastern Minnesota; south and west to the Rio Grande just below its confluence with the Pecos River; and east along the gulf coast, through the Florida panhandle and southern Georgia. Some authorities consider Salix gooddingii as a variety of S. nigra, which extends the range to the Western United States (3,9). -The native range of black willow.",Native Range,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Black willow is dioecious. No consistently reliable morphological characteristics are associated with the identification of the sexes. Male and female are indistinguishable except during flowering and seed development. In natural stands the sex ratio is probably 1 to 1, as has been determined for other dioecious tree species, including members of Salicaceae. Flowering begins in February in the southern portion of the range and extends through late June at the northern limits. The many-flowered catkins usually appear at the time of or immediately preceding leafing out. Pollination is mainly by insects; the flowers contain nectar. Pollen is also carried by winds. The seed ripens quickly; 45 to 60 days after pollination the small (3 to 6 mm or 0.12 to 0.24 in) light-brown capsules begin to split open and shed minute green seeds that have a hairy covering. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production usually starts when the trees are about 10 years old, although viable seeds can be obtained at younger ages. Optimum seed-bearing age is from 25 to 75 years. The trees have good seed crops almost every year, with only a few interspersed poor crops and rare failures resulting from late freezes after flower buds have begun to open. Large volumes of seeds are produced; they average 5 million/kg (2.3 million/lb). When the seeds fall, the long silky hairs act as wings to carry the seeds very long distances. The seeds are widely disseminated by wind and water. Seedling Development- Unless the willow seed is floating on water, it must reach the seedbed within 12 to 24 hours because viability is greatly reduced by only a few days of dry conditions. Germination is epigeal. Germinative capacity is usually high and no dormancy is known. Very moist, almost flooded exposed mineral soil is best for satisfactory germination and early development. Full light promotes vigorous growth once the seedling is well established. In a favorable environment, seedlings grow rapidly-often exceeding 1.2 in (4 ft) in height the first year (4). Seedlings grow best when there is abundant moisture available throughout the growing season. In the Mississippi Valley, average heights are 9.8 in (32 ft) and average breast-high diameters are 6.6 cm (2.6 in) when the saplings are 5 years old (4). Vegetative Reproduction- Root stocks of very young willow trees sprout prolifically. Propagation by cuttings is the usual method of artificial regeneration. With adequate moisture, good cuttings, and sufficient cultivation to reduce competition from other vegetation, first-year plantation survival can be close to 100 percent. Post-size willow cuttings have been rooted for use in flood projects to prevent gullies (4).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- In natural stands of the lower Mississippi Valley, 10-year-old trees average 15 in (49 ft) in height and 14 cm (5.6 in) in d.b.h. In 20 years the trees will average 22 in (72 ft) and 19 cm (7.5 in); in 40 years, 31 in (101 ft) and 49 cm (19.4 in). The tallest trees are 43 in (140 ft) high; the largest diameters about 122 cm (48 in) (4). Black willows in the North and those on poor sites in the South generally reach a maximum height of 9 to 18 in (30 to 60 ft) and 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) in d.b.h. These seldom furnish a satisfactory saw log. In well-stocked stands on the best alluvial soils, particularly along the Mississippi River, the tree prunes itself well and produces an acceptably straight trunk which is clear of limbs for an average of 12 in (40 ft). Open-grown willows and willows among small streams and in swamps are generally limby and of limited usefulness. Being a very weak tree, it is especially prone to breakage; almost all large trees have large broken limbs (4). Unmanaged stands in the South have been estimated to yield 315 m³/ha (50 cords/acre) at age 25 and 416 m³ (66 cords) at age 35. The sawtimber volume (Scribner rule) in similar stands has been estimated at 396 m³/ha (28,300 fbm/acre) at 35 years and 560 m³/ha (40,000 fbm/acre) at 50 years. Good sites sustain about 30 m² of basal area per hectare (130 ft²/acre) (4). Black willow is short lived; the greatest age recorded for a sound tree is 70 years and for an unsound tree, 85 years. The average black willow is mature in 55 years (4). Thinning increases yields and reduces mortality when carried out in relatively young (18 to 24 yr) stands. Growth is best when basal area is reduced by about one-half. Spacing between trees after thinning should average 21 times the mean stem diameter-25.4-cm (10-in) trees spaced 5.3 in (17.5 ft) apart. If the factor is 18 or less, the spacing is probably too dense; if 24 or greater, the site is probably not fully utilized (2). Rooting Habit- Willow tends to be shallow rooted, especially on clay-capped alluvial soils. It is seldom found on soil types that undergo seasonal dehydration but is more often present on soils with higher water tables throughout the summer months. Floods may deposit more layers of alluvium in established stands. New roots often develop from adventitious buds formed within the previously exposed trunk. By this means, soil is captured and held to form additional land areas along river courses. Willows also sucker readily. Under certain conditions, an essentially pure willow stand of 1 or more hectares (2.5 acres) may consist of relatively few clones. Reaction to Competition- Black willow is less tolerant of shade than any of its associates and may most accurately be classed as very intolerant. It usually grows in dense, even-aged stands, in which natural mortality is very heavy from sapling stage to maturity. Trees fail to assert dominance, so willow stands periodically stagnate. Stands not properly thinned may lose up to 50 percent of their volume in 5 to 8 years (4). Because of its intolerance and the absence of exposed mineral soil under existing stands, willow does not succeed itself naturally unless fresh sediment is deposited as the stand begins to open up. Thinning should remove the understory trees and must be light to prevent the heavy windthrow and stem breakage, which is common in very open stands. Light, early, and frequent thinning forestalls stagnation and mortality (2). An apparently satisfactory thinning prescription is to leave a stand of about 14.9 to 17.2 m²/ha (65 to 75 ft²/acre) of basal area. Heavy epicormic branching may result if weak trees are released. Damaging Agents- Several insects attack live willow but few cause serious damage. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the cottonwood leaf beetle (Chrysomela scripta), the willow sawfly (Nematus ventralis), and the imported willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolora) sometimes partially, occasionally completely, defoliate willow trees, reducing growth but seldom killing. Stem borers, such as the cottonwood borer (Plectrodera scalator) attack willows and may kill by girdling the base. Twig borers, like the willow-branch borer (Oberea ferruginea), feed on the branches and cause deformities that may be undesirable in ornamentals. Insects are frequently the vectors for disease organisms. Willow blight, the scab and black canker caused by Pollaccia saliciperda, is transmitted by borers. Members of the genus Salix are the only known hosts. Phytophthora cactorum causes bleeding canker, lesions on the lower trunk that discharge a dark-colored, often slimy liquid. Confined to the phloem and cambium area, it can result in death if the canker girdles the trunk. Cytospora chrysosperma causes canker in poplar and willow. Under forest conditions, cytospora canker is of little consequence but when trees become weakened by drought, competition, or neglect, losses can be heavy. In nursery beds, losses of up to 75 percent of cuttings have been reported. Leaf rust caused by Melampsora spp. is common on seedlings throughout the range of black willow. Mistletoes (Phoradendron spp.) damage and deform but seldom kill willows. The yellow-bellied sapsucker feeds on sap from holes they peck through the bark; this early injury to the tree degrades the lumber sawn later. Hot fires kill entire stands. Slow, light fires can seriously wound willow, allowing woodrotting fungi to enter. Once dead, willow deteriorates very rapidly. Top and branch rot account for 86 percent of the cull in willow.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,14,0
"Black willow is most commonly associated with the soil order Entisols, particularly the Haplaquents and Fluvaquents derived from alluvium. Willow grows on almost any soil, but its extensive, shallow roots need an abundant and continuous supply of moisture during the growing season. The species is most common on river margins and batture land, where it occupies (and usually dominates) the lower, wetter, and often less sandy sites. It is also common in swamps, sloughs, and swales, and on the banks of bayous, gullies, and drainage ditches, growing anywhere light and moisture conditions are favorable. It flourishes at, or slightly below, water level and is not appreciably damaged by flooding and silting (4). Although prevalent along most of the Mississippi River, it produces the largest and best formed trees on very low, moist sites in the batture of the lower river.",Soils and Topography,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,15,0
"The wood is light (specific gravity 0.34 to 0.41), usually straight grained, without characteristic odor or taste, weak in bending, compression, and moderately high in shock resistance. It works well with tools, glues well, and stains and finishes well but is very low in durability. The wood was once used extensively for artificial limbs, because it is lightweight, doesn't splinter easily, and holds its shape well. It is still used for boxes and crates, furniture core stock, turned pieces, table tops, slack cooperage, wooden novelties, charcoal, and pulp. Black willow was a favorite for soil stabilization projects in the early efforts at erosion control. The ease with which the species establishes itself from cuttings continues to make it an excellent tree for revetments. Ancient pharmacopoeia recognized the bark and leaves of willow as useful in the treatment of rheumatism. In 1829, the natural glucoside salicin was isolated from willow. Today it is the basic ingredient of aspirin, although salicyclic acid is synthesized rather than extracted from its natural state.",Special Uses,Black Willow,salix,nigra,hardwood,16,0
"Blue oak is the principal component of the forest cover type Blue Oak-Digger Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 250) (25). In general, it is neighbor to California Black Oak (Type 246) and Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245) at higher elevations and to the annual grass savannah at lower elevations. In the northern Coast Range, and in the foothills of the Klamath Mountains, Oregon White Oak (Type 233) often abuts Blue Oak-Digger Pine. In portions of its range, the upper elevational border of blue oak often grades into more dense stands of interior live oak and chaparral. Similarly at lower elevations, it blends into more open stands of valley oak (Quercus lobata). Throughout, dense stands and scattered patches of chaparral are often present. A grassy understory almost always can be found beneath blue oak trees. Stands of scrubby oaks sometimes bridge the gap between oak trees and woody shrubs in parts of the blue oak range. For most of the range, blue oak should be regarded as a component of a mosaic that includes savannah, chaparral, other deciduous and evergreen oaks, and at least one common conifer. The paleobotanic record of blue oak shows a Miocene progenitor, Quercus douglasoides, which apparently inhabited a wider natural distribution than its modern counterpart. In the next epoch, the Pliocene, blue oak's fossilized equivalent, Q. orindensis, grew in a habitat of dry open slopes bordering valleys. It was associated with several chaparral species, a few elements of the broad-sclerophyll forest, several riparian species, and an occasional redwood and fir (7). The California oak woodland, in general, is recognized as climax, but the successional status of blue oak is not clear. A substantiating tenet of climax is that the same vegetation returns after each gross disturbance. Fire and grazing are, and have been, chronic to the point that the present stands are still recovering from them. That the oak woodland exists after all this disturbance, and that its boundaries have remained rather constant, support the designation of climax (10). The most common tree associate of blue oak is Digger pine (Pinus sabiniana); however, blue oak extends farther into valleys, but not as far into montane regions as the pine. Blue oak is usually the majority species, Digger pine inevitably the taller. Other occasional conifer associates are ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa), knobcone pine (P attenuata) and, in a more limited area, Coulter pine (P. coulteri). California juniper (Juniperus californica) and singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla) are infrequent associates in the Tehachapi and Piute Ranges of southern California. Interior live oak and valley oak are the most common hardwood associates of blue oak. Others are California black oak, coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), Oregon white oak (Q. garryana), toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), California redbud (Cercis occidentalis), and California buckeye (Aesculus californica). Shrub associates of blue oak in its main distribution are neither abundant nor diverse. Principal shrub associates are: common manzanita (Arctostaphylos manzanita), mariposa manzanita (A. mariposa), whiteleaf manzanita (A. viscida), buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus), poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum), foothill gooseberry (Ribes quercetorum), and chaparral coffeeberry (Rhamnus californica tomentella). Grasses are particularly abundant in the natural range of blue oak. Originally they were of the bunchgrass type, Stipa (needlegrass) being the most common genus. Introduced annual grasses, especially the wild oats (Avena fatua) and (A.barbata) have replaced the perennial grasses almost completely. Other annual grasses common beneath blue oak are members of the genera Bromus and Hordeum. Blue oak adapts well to harsh environments, especially aridity. In mid-August of a dry year, valley oak and coast live oak on alluvial soils indicated a minimum (predawn) moisture stress of only 2.03 to 5.07 bars (2 to 5 atmospheres). Nearby blue oaks on an upland soil showed 27.36 bars (27 atmospheres) of stress (10). Blue oak sheds its leaves when stress becomes prohibitive, thus conserving moisture. This ability to withstand more severe moisture stress than its associates contributes to the pattern of blue oak distribution over the landscape.",Associated Forest Cover,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,1,0
"Hot dry summers and cool wet winters typify the climate where blue oaks are found. The mean maximum July temperature averages 32° C (90° F) and the mean January minimum -1° C (30° F). Temperatures for stands outside the main distribution, especially at higher and lower elevations and on the border of the Mojave Desert, vary much more. Mean July maximum temperatures range between 21° and 38° C (70° and 100° F) and mean January minimums from -12° to 2° C (10° to 35° F). The frost-free growing season varies from 150 to 300 days. Annual precipitation averages 510 to 1020 mm. (20 to 40 in) within the main distribution of blue oak. At extremes of the natural range, 1520 mm. (60 in) in Shasta County and 250 mm (10 in) in Kern County bracket the annual fall of moisture. Throughout, most of the precipitation is rain, although snow occasionally blankets the land. Most precipitation (60 to 90 percent) occurs between November 1 and April 30.",Climate,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,2,0
"Blue oak hybridizes with its white oak associates, particularly valley oak, Oregon white oak, California scrub oak (Q.dumosa), and turbinella oak. In most instances the natural hybrids formed by these crosses are fertile and cytologically normal. The binomial for Quercus douglasii x turbinella is Quercus x alvordiana Eastw. and the common name is Alvord oak (37). The Alvord oak is distributed widely from Monterey County southward into the Tehachapi Mountains and is the dominant oak in some foothill woodlands instead of blue oak (11).",Genetics,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,7,0
"Blue oak, a California endemic, has a north-south range of about 740 km (460 mi). Its distribution, in general, surrounds California's Central Valley. Northern limits are Montgomery Creek in Shasta County and southern limits are in the Liebre Mountains of Los Angeles County and the Santa Ynez Valley of Santa Barbara County. Blue oaks are scattered over the landscape above Mission Santa Barbara less than 5 km (3 mi) from the Pacific Coast, and on Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Islands (11). -The native range of blue oak.",Native Range,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Blue oak is monoecious; its flowers are unisexual. Staminate flowers are borne in slender drooping catkins, one or more from lower axils of leaves of the previous year. Pistillate flowers are greenish-yellow and originate from leaf axils of the current year (26). Blue oak flowers from late March to mid-May, depending on elevation, aspect, climate, and reproductive capability of individual trees. In general, trees at lower elevations and on warmer aspects bloom first. On long continuous hillsides, however, blooming is first on midslopes-above areas of cold air ponding and below ridgetops. Acorns mature in one growing season. When about half size, the cup covers about half the acorn, but at maturity the cup encapsulates only 10 to 20 percent of it. The elliptical, often tear-shaped acorns form singly or in clusters of two, rarely three, and are variable in size and shape. Fully developed acorns range from 2.5 to 4.0 cm (1.0 to 1.6 in) in length and from 12 to 21 mm (0.5 to 0.8 in) in diameter. Acorns range in color from light green during development to yellowish-green in early September, to medium-dark brown at maturity. Seed Production and Dissemination- Abundant seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years, with bumper crops every 5 to 8 years (26). In other years at least a few trees are fruitful. Aborted acorns begin falling in July and are mostly gone from the trees by late August. Insect-infested acorns fall in late August to mid-September, usually preceding the fall of mature acorns. Most sound acorns fall between mid-September and the end of October. They average 45/kg (100 seed/lb) and range from 25 to 82/kg (55 to 180/lb). Seed crops vary in size. On one area the acorn crop ranged from 0.14 to 25.31 kg (0.31 to 55.81 lb) per tree per year; on another an average-sized blue oak produced 215 acorns per square meter (20/ft²) of collecting ground during a good seed year or 73 kg (160 lb) of acorns per tree. Data relating acorn production to tree size are scanty- A single blue oak in Shasta County, 34 cm (13.5 in) in d.b.h., 11.6 m (38 ft) tall, and 4.3 m (14.0 ft) in crown width, produced an estimated 3,750 acorns during an especially productive year. At least some roots of this tree, however, extended beneath a well-watered lawn. An examination in December beneath this and nearby trees showed that all developed acorns had been consumed or carried away. Two insects produce larvae that destroy many acorns before maturity. Developing acorns are attacked by the filbert weevil (Curculio uniformis) and by the filbert worm (Melissopus latiferreanus). Larvae of the filbert weevil are short, fat, glistening, white, legless worms. They mine inside the acorn and destroy its contents. Larvae of the filbertworm often hollow out the acorn, leaving behind a mass of webbing and frass (5). Acorns are eaten by at least a dozen species of songbirds, several upland gamebirds, several small mammals (mostly rodents), and a few large mammals. Although many acorns are consumed, some are dropped or lost-aiding in the dissemination of the oak. Principal consumers of blue oak acorns include the acorn woodpecker, scrub jay, band-tailed pigeon, California quail, western gray squirrel, and the California ground squirrel (21). The acorns are a valuable foodstuff, along with green and dead leaves, for deer, cattle, sheep, and hogs (8). For the acorn woodpecker, acorns are the ""staff of life."" Those from blue oak enable this bird to widen its natural range to include extensive areas of the Central Valley and surrounding foothills (30). For band-tailed pigeons, crop and stomach analyses indicated blue oak acorns constituted 5.8 percent of total food volume in November (32). Western gray squirrels were collected below the chaparral zone in Mendocino County where blue oak was the majority species. Acorns amounted to 38 percent of total yearly diet and were consumed each month from September through April (34). In Madera County, CA, ground squirrels consume blue oak acorns each month of the year. Acorns constitute 1 to 56 percent of this rodent's total diet each month (31). Acorns of blue oak are critical to migrating deer who leave a dried-up summer range in the Sierra Nevada and travel to a winter range at lower elevations. Acorns picked up en route provide energy and protein not only for travel, but also help to ensure healthy animals during the breeding season. Seedling Development- On the basis of frequency and magnitude of seed crops, blue oak has the potential to reproduce adequately from seed. During the last 50 to 80 years, however, it appears to have reproduced poorly. In Tulare County, only 7 percent of 405 trees, as determined from increment cores, were less than 60 years old (22). In southern Shasta County, on a green fuelbreak 30.5 m (100 ft) wide along a highway, only blue oaks remained in some places, with several grasses and a few woody shrubs below. The oaks were evenly spaced and formed a parklike stand which might be expected to reproduce well, but when 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of the fuelbreak was examined, only eight seedlings were found (24). Blue oak seedlings were not always scarce. In 1908, Sudworth (35) reported seedlings scarce on cultivated or grazed ground but ""rather abundant elsewhere."" Cooper (6) noted that ""typical stands of young Quercus douglasii have been seen where it is certain that chaparral was formerly in control."" Griffin (10) also noted that ""the oak produced well at an earlier period"" (before 1930) in the Santa Lucia Range. Heavy consumption of acorns and damage to seedlings by deer, cattle, sheep, hogs, insects, and rodents, and especially by ground squirrels and pocket gophers, are possible reasons why blue oaks have not reproduced adequately during the past 60 to 80 years. Environmental and chemical inhibition of acorn germination as a result of introduced annual grasses is another possible reason. Single environmental and habitat factors probably are not adequate to explain the paucity of blue oak reproduction (1,23). For successful germination, the seeds must be covered. Thick leaf litter or loose mineral soil facilitates germination and early seedling survival. Acorns will germinate on the soil surface in the rare event that temperatures remain low and moisture adequate. Acorns of the white oak group do not require stratification for germination. Blue oak acorns can, and do, germinate within a month of seedfall. Most, however, germinate early in the spring when warmer temperatures prevail. Germination is hypogeal. Light, moisture, temperature, and the depth of soil or litter covering the acorns probably affect the timing of germination. Germinative capacity from a limited number of tests was 70 to 72 percent after 30 days (26). Early growth of blue oak seedlings is poorly documented. One investigator seeded 25 acorns in a granitic soil in November and dug them up in March. Root length ranged from 31 to 68 cm (12 to 27 in) and averaged 49 cm. (19 in) (9). After 1 year, blue oak seedlings on a gravelly loam soil in Shasta County averaged about 10 cm (4 in) above ground and 20 cm (8 in) below. A 3-year-old seedling growing in partial shade showed about 18 cm (7 in) of shoots and 28 cm (11 in) of roots. Nearby, a 5-year-old seedling was 18 cm (7 in) tall with a single taproot 66 cm (26 in) long. All eight seedlings in an area cut about 10 years ago were less than 46 cm. (18 in) tall (24). All were browsed and most had died back to the root crown and resprouted at least once, often with several stems. This evidence, although limited, suggests that the annual growth rate of blue oak seedlings is probably slow. Vegetative Reproduction- Two types of sprouts are found on blue oak stumps. Some form at the root collar and are root crown sprouts, and others form on the side or top of cut and burned stumps and are stool sprouts. Blue oak produces sprouts after cutting or fire, but in general is regarded as a weak sprouter. Whether this characteristic results from lack of early sprout vigor or from lack of eventual survival is not clear. Nearly 40 blue oak stumps in a southern Shasta County fuelbreak were examined, and the average number of root crown sprouts per clump was recorded. Positions of sprouts on stumps, and stump diameters also were noted. Stump heights averaged 13 cm (5 in) (24). The trees had been cut about 10 years before the stumps were examined. Presumably most of the sprouts began growing soon after, but others could have originated later, and a few obviously were recent. Sprouts, therefore, were assumed to be as old as 10 years. Number of root crown sprouts related weakly to stump diameter. The number of sprouts per stump increased curvilinearly from about 12 sprouts on 2-cm (1-in) diameter stumps to 27 sprouts on 15-cm (6-in) diameter stumps. Larger stumps, at least up to 22 cm (9 in) in diameter, produced a decreasing number of sprouts. Two stumps larger than 40 cm (16 in) in diameter showed no evidence of sprouting (24). In the inner Coast Range of central California, blue oak produced fewer sprouts than associated oaks and no sprouts on stumps larger than 52 cm (21 in) (18). When height of sprouts was compared with stump diameter, no relationship was discernible. Much variation was present. Some sprout clumps looked sickly, others thrifty, still others were browsed or infested with galls, while others were free of such maladies. Some sprouts had died back for part of their length and others were dead. Stool sprouts develop on high stumps, large old stumps, and stumps with debris piled around them. For stumps cut 13 cm (5 in) above ground, only those larger than 20 cm (8 in) in diameter produced stool sprouts. Three 20-cm (8-in) diameter stumps produced mostly stool sprouts and a few root crown sprouts. Another 20-cm (8-in) stump yielded 70 stool sprouts and a 30-cm (12-in) stump produced 12 stool sprouts (24).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Throughout the range of blue oak, about 90 percent of trees in natural stands are single stems. Some of these may fork just above groundline, but each originates as a single entity. These trees probably grew from acorns. Of the remaining 10 percent, where two or three stems are growing close together, origin could be from closely spaced acorns or from sprouts. Tree growth is a function of many variables, especially site quality, topography, and stand density. Tree height-diameter site index curves are available (33). Taller blue oak trees frequently grow on deeper soils, near bases of hillsides, or close to ephemeral streams in canyons and draws. In Shasta County, CA, for example, two blue oaks 56 ern (22 in) in d.b.h. were located about 35 m (115 ft) apart. One was growing on an alluvial flat near a permanent stream, the other on an old terrace about 8 m (26 ft) above the flat. The two trees differed in height by 10 m (34 ft) (24). Stand density varies widely from a few trees scattered throughout the savannah to fairly dense stands in the woodland. In the latter, stand density of blue oak can reach more than 1,000 trees per hectare (405/acre) (10). Some stands are made up of trees evenly spaced over the landscape that are remarkably similar in height, diameter, and form. Other stands vary widely, with tree diameters ranging from 8 to 76 cm (3 to 30 in), and with form varying between stunted and crooked stems to those that are straight and tall. Loose groups also are formed. Sometimes a group will consist of trees of a single size class; at other times the group will include trees of several size classes. Data that quantify tree growth are scarce. Studies in Nevada, Placer, and Shasta Counties show that height growth in general is slow (24). After trees reach 65 cm (26 in) in d.b.h., height growth is extremely slow, or ceases (fig. 3). Blue oak seldom exceeds 125 cm (49 in) in d.b.h. or 25 m (82 ft) in height. A champion blue oak, found in Alameda County, measured 196 cm (77 in) in d.b.h., 28.7 m (94 ft) in height, and had a crown spread of 14.6 m (48 ft) (27). Figure 3- Diameter-height relatioship of dominant blue oak in natural stands in northern and central California. Diameter-age data also are scanty. Blue oak stands in Tulare County ranged in age from 30 to over 300 years. Regression analyses (22) indicated a broad range of age, as determined at 60 cm (24 in) above mean groundline, for a given d.b.h. On good sites in Nevada (36) and Shasta Counties (24), this relationship proved to be linear for trees up to about 65 cm (26 in) in d.b.h. Trees 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. were 40 years old, those 40 cm (16 in) were 82 years old, and trees 60 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. averaged about 125 years. On poorer sites, trees 36 to 51 cm (14 to 20 in) in d.b.h. were from 175 to 280 years old. A large tree in Sequoia National Park was 390 years old (22). The species is believed to live even longer. Yield information is restricted to volume and weight tables for blue oak in California's central coastal counties (28). Selected gross volumes are as follows: Epicormic branching is common in blue oaks of all ages. It is greatest on injured trees, recently released trees, and trees bordering openings. In present hardwood log grading rules, it constitutes a degrade. Blue oaks in irrigated lawns and flowerbeds produce many short, weak epicormic branches which, if removed, are replaced every year. Rooting Habit- The warm dry soils typical of the blue oak habitat mandate that seedling and tree roots grow rapidly downward and stay in a zone of adequate moisture. This suggests a taproot system with one or more deep-growing members. The taproot system begins early in the life of the seedling. Acorns germinate early, before those of other oak associates, and roots grow downward in spite of low temperatures. Most available energy is channeled to development of deep roots, before shoots emerge, and continues after shoot growth begins. The ratio of leaf area to root weight is small. About 73 percent of blue oak's dry weight is allocated to below-ground material the first growing season (20). A study in Placer County, CA, showed that roots from a blue oak 7 cm (3 in) in d.b.h. extended 13 in (42 ft) to groundwater; those of three trees 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. penetrated to 20 m (67 ft); and those of an oak 18 cm (7 in) in d.b.h. extended to 24 m (80 ft) (17). Reaction to Competition- Rarely is blue oak found in an understory. Even when growing in mixed-size groups, the smaller trees are positioned to receive considerable overhead light. The species appears to be adapted to long periods of direct sunlight and can most accurately be classed as intolerant of shade. Damaging Agents- The bark of blue oak is thin, relative to other oak species, and with age becomes deeply fissured and flaky. It catches fire easily, burns well, and does not provide much protection from fire (29). Leaves on part of the crown, however, can be killed by ground fire one year and replaced the next, with no apparent ill effect to the tree. The species, therefore, is probably better adapted to withstand the quick heat from a grassland fire than to tolerate the more sustained heat from burning chaparral. Animal damage to blue oak is mostly from loss of foliage by deer, cattle, and other browsers, and from root injury by pocket gophers. Seedlings are particularly vulnerable to both browsers and pocket gophers. Little has been written about diseases of blue oak, but several are prevalent. Probably the most severe are those that damage the heartwood of the trunk and large limbs. Inonotus dryophilus is one of these, causing a white pocket rot in the heartwood of living oaks. The sulphur conk, Laetiporus sulphureus, causes a brown cubical rot also of the heartwood of living oaks. The hedgehog fungus (Hydnum erinaceum) and the artist's fungus (Ganoderma applanatum) are also capable of destroying the heartwood of living oaks. A disease of blue oak roots that sometimes extends a short distance up the bole is the shoestring fungus rot, Armillaria mellea. This fungus gradually weakens trees at the base until they fall. A white root rot caused by Inonotus dryadeus also has been reported on blue oak. Several fungi attack dead sapwood, particularly if the tree is on the ground and in the shade. Two common sapwood decomposers are Polyporus versicolor and Stereum hirsutum. A number of diseases attack leaves of blue oak, but most have not been identified. Powdery mildews, especially Sphaerotheca lanestris and Microsphaera alni, are common. An unknown disease of blue oaks growing in well-watered lawns kills nearly every leaf on the tree in midsummer. The leaves turn brown and persist until the usual time of leaf fall. Normal leaf development takes place the next spring. True mistletoe (Phoradendron villosum subsp. villosum) often infects older open-grown blue oaks. Its effect on them is undetermined although the pest must cost its host a certain amount of growth increment. A large number of insects infest blue oak. One study recorded 38 species of insects in 21 families inhabiting blue oak (4). Two additional insects, a leaf skeletonizer and a wood borer, are recorded in another study (14). No part of the tree is spared. Sucking and chewing insects attack the twigs and leaves, boring insects infest the roots, trunk, and limbs, and other insects ruin twigs and acorns. Many of the insects are found in low numbers, but when epidemics occur, damage can be severe. A local but intensive epidemic of the fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospila), for example, was noted in Contra Costa County in the early 1970's (3). Blue oaks were badly defoliated by this insect in June; by mid-July a second crop of leaves had taken their place. More than 40 species of cynipid wasps form galls on blue oak (38). Galls range from small to large, dull to brightly colored, round to oblong, and smooth to spiny. They were found on every part of the tree: the roots, catkins, buds, acorns, stems, and leaves. Of those on stems and leaves, many are firmly attached; others eventually fall to the ground. Two of the most interesting are formed by the spined turban gall wasp (Antron douglasii) and jumping oak gall wasp (Neuoterus saltatorius). The turban gall wasp creates from one to four bright purplish-pink galls on the underside of a leaf. The adult jumping oak gall wasp stings the underside of mature blue oak leaves and then lays its eggs inside the leaf. Larvae emerge in July and August and form a light-tan gall less than 0.02 cm (0.06 in) in diameter. These galls fall to the ground about mid-August, often in large numbers, the movement of the larvae causing the ground to seemingly come alive. Possibly the jumping around is an attempt by the larvae within to find cracks and crevices in which to hide, and thereby escape from enemies and bad weather.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,14,0
"Soils from a variety of parent materials support blue oak. They are characteristically shallow, skeletal, infertile, thermic, and moderately to excessively well drained. Textures range from gravelly loam through stony clay loam. Soils with extensive rock fragments in the profile commonly support this oak; as much as 50 percent of the surface area of a soil may be covered with stones or rock outcrops. Blue oaks are found on soils with depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in), but scattered trees grow on soils ranging from 30 to 51 cm (12 to 20 in). Soil orders for blue oak are Alfisols and Inceptisols, occasionally Mollisols. More than 40 soil series in California have been identified by the California Cooperative Soil-Vegetation Survey and the National Cooperative Soil Survey as supporting blue oak. The principal California mountain ranges and soil series are as follows: The one characteristic found most often in soils supporting blue oak is high base saturation. Values of at least 50 percent or even 90 to 100 percent are common (19). Soils within blue oak's natural range that do not support it are generally drained poorly or are of heavy clay texture, often with a hardpan near the soil surface. Deep fertile soils are seldom clothed with blue oak because this species is not competitive with the inherently taller conifers or the better adapted interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii) and California black oak (Q. kelloggii). Blue oak grows within a fairly wide elevational range-from the valley floor in the north to the midslopes of Mount Pinos in the south. Corresponding elevational limits are 50 to 1800 m (165 to 5,900 ft). At the north end of the Sacramento Valley and in the foothills of the southern Cascade and Klamath Mountains, the general elevational range of blue oak is 152 to 610 m (500 to 2,000 ft). The species is common between 76 and 915 m (250 and 3,000 ft) in the central Coast Range, and between 168 and 1370 m (550 and 4,500 ft) in the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges. On west slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the species is abundant in the foothills at an elevational. range of 152 to 915 m (500 to 3,000 ft) (35).",Soils and Topography,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,15,0
"Although strong, hard, and heavy, the wood of this oak currently has little or no commercial use, not so much because of its qualities, but because of the short stature and poor form of the tree. Products have been limited to fenceposts and fuelwood, with the latter use increasing greatly in recent years. Throughout the range of blue oak, especially on its margins and in the Coast Ranges, woody shrubs have been eliminated to encourage forage for livestock, leaving the blue oaks and valley oaks. In other areas, oaks have been reduced greatly or eliminated and a savannah formed with the intent of producing more forage for livestock. When many trees are removed, large increases in forage occur (15,16). When blue oak density is low or moderate, however, the grass seems to be taller, has more nutrients, produces more biomass, grows earlier, and stays greener longer in the growing season under oaks (12,13). Furthermore, living oak roots hold the soil in place on steep slopes and reduce the incidence of mass movement downslope into permanent and ephemeral streams. Elimination of the oaks, therefore, could be a dubious practice. Blue oak has been used for decoration: large branches hollowed out by heart rot are sawn into sections, cleaned, coated with resin and hardener, and filled with dried seedstalks, for use as wall hangings and table centerpieces. Blue oak acorns were a favored food of California Indians. On a scale of 1 (preferred) to 3 (undesirable) they rated blue oak acorns 1.5 (2). The acorns average about 4,994 calories per kilogram (2,265/lb) and are a potential source of human food.",Special Uses,Blue Oak,quercus,douglasii,hardwood,16,0
"Blue spruce is a species of the montane zone in the central and southern Rocky Mountains, where it is the principal species of the Blue Spruce forest cover type (Society of American Foresters Type 216) (27). Blue spruce is also named as a minor associate in four other types: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206), Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Cottonwood-Willow (Type 235), and Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237). Over the bulk of its range, blue spruce is most frequently associated with Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) and Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine and with white fir (Abies concolor) on mesic sites in the central Rocky Mountains. Blue spruce is seldom found in large numbers, but on streamside sites it is often the only coniferous species present. Hardwoods associated with blue spruce are most commonly narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia), quaking aspen (P. tremuloides), and occasionally balsam poplar (P. balsamifera). Smaller streamside trees and common shrub associates are water birch (Betula occidentalis), mountain alder (Alnus tenuifolia), shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and species of willow (Salix). On north-facing slopes, blue spruce, rarely found more than 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) above the drainage bottoms, mixed with Douglas-fir or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) (24). At higher elevations, above 2590 m (8,500 ft), blue spruce may mingle with Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and quaking aspen on moist sites, or lodgepole pine on drier sites (49). In its southern range (southwestern Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico) blue spruce is part of the widespread mixed conifer forest as a component of several diverse habitat types constituting topoedaphic climaxes in stream bottoms and meadow borders. In general, blue spruce dominates habitats that are too warm for Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir and that are wetter than those typically occupied by ponderosa pine. Shrub associates include Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), common juniper (Juniperus communis), and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), as well as alders and willows on the moister sites (50,65). In its northern range (northern Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana), blue spruce is found only in scattered locations under established stands of narrowleaf cottonwood and among scattered ponderosa pine, with Engelmann spruce and white spruce (Picea glauca) associated with the species in the extreme north (64,84).",Associated Forest Cover,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,1,1
"Blue spruce grows in a climatic zone that is generally cool and humid, with most of the annual precipitation occurring in the summer. Mean annual temperatures where blue spruce is most commonly found in Colorado and the Southwest range from 3.9° to 6.1° C (39° to 43° F), with a January mean of -3.9° to -2.8° C (25° to 27° F) and a July mean of 13.9° to 15.0° C (57° to 59° F). Mean minimum January temperatures range from -11.1° to 8.9° C (12° to 16° F) and mean maximum July temperatures range from 21.1° to 22.2° C (70° to 72° F). The frost-free period from June to August is about 55 to 60 days (5,69). Average annual precipitation varies from 460 to 610 mm (18 to 24 in). Winter is usually precipitation-deficient, with less than 20 percent of the annual moisture falling from December through March. Fifty percent of the annual precipitation is rain that falls during the growing season (5,69). Although blue spruce grows best with abundant moisture, this species can withstand drought better than any other spruce (36). It can also withstand extremely low temperatures (-40° C; -40° F), and it is more resistant to high insolation and frost damage than other associated species.",Climate,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,2,1
"From studies of morphological features of blue spruce and Engelmann spruce, it has been concluded that these two species do not hybridize in nature, although no morphological character absolutely separates the two (16). Considerable overlap in cone size has been found; Engelmann spruce cones vary from 2.8 to 5.8 cm (1.1 to 2.3 in) and blue spruce cones vary from 4.5 to 10.7 cm (1.8 to 4.2 in) in neighboring populations measured in northern Colorado (33). Cone and seed characteristics are often found to be indistinguishable (40). Controlled crosses between blue spruce and Engelmann spruce obtained up to 2 percent sound seed set when Engelmann spruce was the female parent (29). The reciprocal cross was also successful. Only occasional embryos developed following crosses between the two species, but, more frequently, reproductive failure occurred prior to embryo formation (57). Much overlap between blue spruce and Engelmann spruce in cortical monoterpene content has also been observed, although species differences in the quantity of several of the compounds are statistically significant. Oleoresins of blue spruce contain higher levels of tricyclene, (a-pinene, camphene, and bornyl acetate, whereas Engelmann spruce oleoresins contain higher levels of b-pinene, 3-carene, terpinolene, and several unknown compounds (80). These and other results (42) indicate that hybridization between blue spruce and Engelmann spruce is possible. This might account for the various intergrades between blue spruce, white spruce, and Engelmann spruce that have been reported in Montana (83). Information on inheritance patterns for certain characteristics of blue spruce, although somewhat inconclusive, is provided by results of half-sib and full-sib progeny studies involving that species. For example, in a Canadian study (13,14), inheritance of needle coloration was investigated using such controlled crosses. A qualitative rating scale of one (green) to four (silvery blue) was used for comparison. Although the proportion of blue seedlings was not significantly related to the blue color ratings of their open-pollinated parents, the needle-color ratings of 10-year progeny were related to those of their self-pollinated parents (r = 0.83). One selfed tree produced 94 percent blue progeny. As is true for certain other coniferous species, albinism in blue spruce is apparently controlled by a single gene. The proportion of normal (green) to albino seedlings derived from self-pollinated seeds of two different trees produce a good fit to a 3:1 ratio, suggesting heterozygosity for a simple lethal factor (12). In Michigan studies, hybrid progeny from crosses between white spruce and blue spruce showed a slight, but nonsignificant, increase in germination rate over the parental half-sib progeny, and at 42 weeks, needle length was intermediate between those of the parental progeny. Although the hybrid progeny as a group displayed intermediacy in 3-carene biosynthesis ability between the two parents, individual-tree values showed genetic segregation in the open-pollinated (half-sib) blue spruce progeny and uniformity in the open-pollinated (half-sib) white spruce progeny (42). Yet, the range of values for 3-carene biosynthesis ability is controlled by a single pair of alleles, as had been shown for western white pine (Pinus monticola) (38). However, when natural populations of blue spruce were studied for this characteristic, allele frequencies for the 3-carene gene did not conform to expected values in Colorado and New Mexico populations, although they did conform to expected single-gene frequencies in the Utah, Arizona, and Wyoming populations (39). These apparent discrepancies could be artifacts of sample size or other unknown factors. Whereas the initiation date of germination of hybrid seed has been found to be intermediate between parental (half-sib) seed of blue spruce and Engelmann spruce, cotyledon number, mean day of total germination, and hypocotyl color tend to be similar to those of female parent (29). That cotyledon number is under strong maternal control, as it also is in white spruce (31), is supported by a recent study, in which cotyledon number differed significantly (P = .001) between half-sib Colorado families but not within those families (20). From studies of controlled crosses among white spruce, blue spruce, and red spruce (Picea rubens), F2 progeny of white spruce x blue spruce crosses were found to be much stunted in height and in needle length (7). Further results of findings among these species are summarized in table 3. In summary, it would appear that for most needle, chemical synthesis, and germination characteristics that have been studied in blue spruce, the gene action is quantitative. Exceptions to this seem manifest in the biosynthetic ability of 3-carene and in the production of albino seedlings, which may be single-gene controlled, and cotyledon number, hypocotyl color, and mean germination date, which may be under strong maternal influence in that species.",Hybrids,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,9,1
"Blue spruce is primarily native to the central and southern Rocky Mountains of the western United States. Its range extends from latitude 33° 50' to 48° 54' N. and from longitude 104° 45' to 114° 00' W.; the Rocky Mountain region in high mountains from southern and western Wyoming, eastern Idaho, south to Utah, northern and eastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, to central Colorado. It has been reported in isolated locations in north-central Montana (83). - The native range of blue spruce.",Native Range,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,11,1
"In a study of seven blue spruce provenances from Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, grown in North Dakota, 5-year survival varied from 22 percent for the Targee National Forest, WY, source to 96 percent for an Ashley National Forest, UT, source (18). In the same study, height differed significantly among the sources; the two sources from Ashley National Forest represented the tallest (57.3 cm; 22.6 in) and the shortest (37.5 cm; 14.8 in). No latitudinal or altitudinal pattern of survival, growth, or frost resistance seemed apparent. In a Michigan nursery study of progenies from 50 populations collected throughout its range, 2-year-old blue spruce seedlings from Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona grew more rapidly than those from Utah, Wyoming, or Montana. The average heights of the 10 tallest populations ranged from 18.8 to 16.1 cm (7.4 to 6.3 in) (40). Variation in foliage color is apparently under strong genetic control (15), although the mechanism of inheritance is not presently known. Because there is no consistency in blue color from any one source, color variation is a characteristic to expect with seed-produced trees (47). Two-year-old progenies from Arizona and New Mexico seed sources show a much higher incidence of ""blueness"" than those from other areas (40). However, little or no difference has been detected between seedlings with glaucous (bluish) or non-glaucous (greenish) needles in photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and moisture retention (75). These studies suggest that genetic variation in natural populations of blue spruce does not conform to a clinal pattern. Rather, the pattern appears to be ecotypic, with considerable stand-to-stand variation and individual tree variation. Significant variation exists among populations in the concentration of terpenes derived from cortical tissue. Five populations, each consisting of 10 selected seed trees, differed significantly in the concentration of each of eight monoterpenes in a Michigan study. Although the total percentages of the eight monoterpenes were similar among the populations, the Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming populations were distinct from the New Mexico and Arizona populations due to percentages of specific monoterpenes. For example, the average percentage of a-pinene was 14.3 for the three northern populations and 8.5 for the two southern ones, whereas b-phellandrene averaged 0.58 percent for the northern populations and 0.89 percent for the southern populations (39). Large differences in monoterpene yield exist in xylem, bark, and needles of individual blue spruce trees, and variation in terpene yield among trees is significant. The concentration of the terpenes in the needles and xylem varies with crown position, the yield increasing with tree height in the xylem and decreasing with tree height in the needles. These yields are correlated with the proportions of resin canals in the respective tissues (66). Several investigators have reported different results in blue spruce seedlings grown under accelerated greenhouse conditions (20,39,40,41). In a recent study, height growth of 75 single-tree Colorado sources, grown under accelerated greenhouse conditions, varied significantly among six seed zones but not among families within a seed zone. Seed zone averages ranged from 22.2 cm for the tallest to 14.2 cm for the shortest during the 140-day test period (20). In their reports of a rangewide provenance study of blue spruce conducted in Michigan, investigators noted that the southern sources of blue spruce did not grow as well under accelerated greenhouse conditions as did the northern sources (6,8,41). In contrast, in the Colorado study, southern Colorado sources generally outgrew the northern Colorado sources. It is interesting to note that in field plantations subsequently established in several midwestern states and Quebec with their blue spruce sources, the Michigan investigators observed a reversal of the variation patterns that they had observed in the greenhouse. In the field plantations, the southern sources outgrew the northern sources (9,10,87). Thus, growth of the seedlings studied in Colorado in the greenhouse followed much the same patterns as the seedlings that were grown outdoors in the Michigan studies. In only a single study has the date of bud set been recorded in blue spruce. Within latitudinal groups in Colorado, bud set varied with elevation of the seedling seed source, the high-elevation sources setting bud much sooner than the low-elevation sources (20). Some investigators (6,87) have found no consistent pattern or date of bud break in the 400 widely distributed sources of blue spruce studied. And others (10) found that bud break was variously related to longitude but not to elevation. Yet the results of the Colorado study, based on relatively intensive elevational sampling, show a relationship between latitude and elevation of seed origin and the date of bud set. Thus, whereas research results support the notion that natural variation of most parameters that have been studied in blue spruce conforms to a discontinuous pattern geographically (18,20,39,40,87), variation in date of bud set conforms to a local altitudinal clinal pattern (20).",Population Differences,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Blue spruce is monoecious. Male strobili develop throughout the living crown of the tree, although they are usually more frequent in the upper one-half of the crown. They commonly develop in whorls of three to five at the base of the current vegetative growth, or singly in subterminal positions (25). Female strobili develop in the upper 10 to 25 percent of the live crown of mature trees. They usually occupy terminal positions on lateral branchlets. Most male strobili of blue spruce are rose red when they emerge from the buds, but on occasional trees they appear yellowish-green. A single male strobilus, containing 100 sporophylls, may produce about 370,000 pollen grains. The female strobili consist of 175 to 225 scales and thus have a potential to produce 350 to 450 seeds per cone. Pollen is shed in May or June, depending upon altitude. For a short period of time following emergence from the bud, the scales of the female strobili are a pale greenish color. As peak receptivity is reached, however, the scales of the strobili on most trees become red and are reflexed 90 degrees or more toward the base of the strobilus, which assumes an erect position on the twig. Occasional trees produce yellowish-green strobili. Approximately 2 weeks following initial receptivity, the female strobilus moves from this erect position to about 45 degrees above horizontal. In another week, 50 percent of the cones on a tree are 45 degrees below horizontal to pendent. During the fourth week, all cones become pendent and reach their full size (24,26,28). Seed Production and Dissemination- Blue spruce is generally considered to be from good to prolific in seed production, yielding full crops of cones every 2 or 3 years (77,84). Some intermediate years are complete failures (24). Seed production begins at approximately 20 years, and optimum seed-bearing age is reached between 50 and 150 years (88). Cones mature in August of the first year; seed shed begins from early to late September, depending on altitude, and continues into the winter (26,77). The seed is wind disseminated, seedfall diminishing rapidly as distance from the source increases; most seeds fall within 90 m (300 ft) of the upwind timber edge (2). It is unlikely that heavy cone crops will occur in successive years on a single blue spruce tree, because the female strobili occupy terminal positions on lateral branchlets. Such terminal positions are at a minimum in the year following one of high seed production, because once a strobilus is differentiated from an apical meristem, only the strobilus develops at that position during the following growing season. If a whorl of new axillary buds is produced on the branchlet at the base of the developing cone, these buds ordinarily produce vegetative shoots for one season before female strobili are again differentiated. Thus, although blue spruce cones occasionally occupy sessile, axillary positions, the likelihood of heavy seed crops occurring more frequently than every 2 years is very remote (24). Seedling Development- Seeds of blue spruce germinate on a variety of media, although natural reproduction is mostly confined to exposed mineral soil with side shade and overhead light in the vicinity of seeding trees. Natural reproduction is scanty, probably because the lightweight seed is prevented from coming into contact with mineral soil by the dense herbage, grass, or other ground-cover vegetation that is usually abundant in the habitat of the species (84). Seeds of blue spruce were once thought to show embryo dormancy. It is now known, however, that blue spruce seeds germinate promptly and completely without prior stratification, under a wide range of temperatures, with or without light (46). Germination is epigeal (77). In most parts of the blue spruce range natural germination of seed takes place in the spring or summer following dispersal and is dependent on adequate precipitation (51). Spring and early summer drought periods occur regularly in the Southwest. Although soils of the mixed conifer forest are wet at the end of winter from melting snows, these drought periods during the growing season create soil moisture deficits that are critical to initial seedling survival. Fall moisture deficits common over the remainder of the range are less limiting to seedling establishment and usually do not kill seedlings established for 2 years or more except on severely affected sites (2,52). Blue spruce seedlings are more sensitive to day temperatures between 13° and 31° C (55° and 88° F) than to night temperatures between 7° and 25° C (45° and 77° F) (86). Under greenhouse conditions, blue spruce seedlings are affected by supplemental light. They grow continuously when exposed to photoperiods exceeding 16 hours and enter dormancy within 4 weeks under photoperiods of 12 hours or less. Dormancy is prevented under 12-hour photoperiods by 2-hour light breaks of red light (1.70 µw/cm² @ 650 nm) or high intensity white light (2,164.29 µw/cm² @ 400 to 800 nm) given in the middle of the 12-hour night (94), or by one-minute light breaks every 30 minutes throughout the night (85). The establishment of blue spruce seedlings under natural conditions is probably benefited by moisture availability and shading, which prolong snow and soil moisture in late spring. Early growth of blue spruce seedlings is very slow. In a Michigan nursery study, the tallest of 50 populations averaged 15.7 cm (6.2 in) at 2 years (40). In North Dakota, the tallest of seven sources was 58.4 cm (23.0 in), 5 years after outplanting (18). Similarly, in a plantation in the southern range, trees were 48.5 to 59.2 cm (19.1 to 23.3 in) tall after five growing seasons (53). Vegetative Reproduction- Natural vegetative reproduction of blue spruce has not been reported. The species does not sprout from the stump or root, but the development of epicormic branches on the trunk is common. Grafting and air-layering have been practiced successfully for many years to perpetuate desired horticultural varieties (32,60,63, 74,91). Success has also been achieved through the rooting of hardwood or greenwood stem cuttings, especially in sand-peat-soil media, or hydroponically (56,79,81,93).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Blue spruce is apparently a long-lived tree, surviving up to 600 years or more. Diameter growth is slow; trees 10 to 13 cm (4 to 5 in) in d.b.h. may be 125 to 135 years old; at 46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 in), they may be 275 to 350 years of age (84). The ""1982 National Register of Big Trees"" lists the largest blue spruce as 154.4 cm (60.8 in) in d.b.h. and 38.4 m (126 ft) tall, on the Gunnison National Forest, CO. Few growth and yield data are available for blue spruce. In one study, in a mixed conifer forest in east-central Arizona, blue spruce was found to constitute a total of 0.7 m²/ha basal area (3.05 ft²/acre) of a total of 40.8 m² (177.7 ft²). The 728-ha (1,800-acre) forest consisted of Douglas-fir (31.4 percent), quaking aspen (15.9 percent), white fir (14.5 percent), ponderosa pine (14.1 percent), Engelmann spruce (13.5 percent), southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) (5.6 percent), corkbark fir (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica) (3.3 percent), and blue spruce (1.7 percent). In this study, the annual basal area growth for blue spruce was found to be 2.9 percent, greater than that of any other species except corkbark fir, which was 3.7 percent per year (22). The total basal area growth for blue spruce, 0.008 m² (0.088 ft²) per year, was distributed as shown in table 1. Rooting Habit- Young seedlings of blue spruce are shallow rooted, with roots penetrating the soil only about 6.4 cm. (2.5 in) during the first year (50). Although blue spruce tissue is not damaged much by freezing, seedling losses can result from frost heaving. Shade in late spring and early fall minimizes such frost-heaving losses (2,69). Even in mature trees, the root system of blue spruce is relatively shallow, compared to that of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, adapting it to the moist site on which it usually grows. In spite of the shallow root system, blue spruce is decidedly windfirm. (36). Pruning roots of blue spruce 5 years before transplanting doubles the total root surface area of 2-meter-tall trees at transplanting time. It also increases the concentration of the root system within the dripline from 40 to 60 percent, an advantage in landscape plantings (90). Reaction to Competition- Blue spruce is classed as intermediate in tolerance of shade, the middle of five tolerance categories for western conifers. It is less tolerant than subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and white fir; it is similar in tolerance to, or slightly more tolerant than, Douglas-fir; it is more tolerant than southwestern white pine, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, quaking aspen, or its other moist-site hardwood associates (4,27,52,62). On cool sites, a dense or moderately dense canopy favors regeneration of subalpine fir, blue spruce, white fir, and Engelmann spruce, to the exclusion of Douglas-fir. On warm sites, an open canopy favors ponderosa pine, whereas a moderate canopy favors Douglas-fir (92). Blue spruce occurs in various seral stages, from pioneer to climax, in 32 currently recognized habitat types (28). The exact successional status depends on the location within its geographic range and on its immediate associates. For example, in the Southwest, blue spruce represents a topo-edaphic climax, one in which environmental factors compensate for one another (17); here it reproduces and is present in all sizes, along stream banks, in well-watered tributaries, on gentle lower slopes, and in forest borders of grassy meadows. On these sites, ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir may be long-lived seral species, white fir and southwestern white pine may occur as minor seral species, and subalpine fir may be of accidental occurrence (58,65). Blue spruce may also form climax stands with Engelmann spruce on slopes and in drainages at higher elevations and with Douglas-fir and white fir (1) on lower slopes and north aspects at lower elevations (65). Blue spruce may be a minor seral species in white fir- and subalpine fir-dominated forests on cooler sites (58), and it may constitute a pioneer species on wet sites (21). In Utah, blue spruce is a climax species in three distinct environments: gentle to steep mountain slopes, floodplains and valley bottoms at lower elevations, and montane sites on alluvium or aqueaceous north-aspect deposits (23). Almost exclusively, sites that support climax stands of blue spruce have parent materials of limestone or calcareous sandstone. Thus, blue spruce probably constitutes an edaphic climax on these sites (62,71). On Utah sites, quaking aspen is the prinicipal seral species, except in the Uinta Mountains, where the seral role is assumed by lodgepole pine. At the higher altitudes in Utah, blue spruce becomes a minor seral species to subalpine fir (71). Damaging Agents- Several insects are known to attack developing cones and seeds of blue spruce, but damage caused by insects is not heavy (55). The spruce seed chalcid (Megastigmus piceae) is found throughout the range of the host. Larvae of the spruce seed moth (Laspeyresia youngana) and the cone cochylid (Henricus fuscodorsana) bore through cone scales near the axis of the cones, destroying both scales and up to 10 percent of the seeds. Larvae of the spruce coneworm (Dioryctria reniculelloides) mine young cones in addition to feeding on tender terminal growth and its foliage (34,45,54). In addition to those attacking developing cones and seeds, other insects occasionally damage blue spruce (34). The larvae of the western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) feed on old needles in late April, then mine developing buds and defoliate new tree growth (59). Heavy, repeated attacks kill the tree. Less serious damage can be caused by the spruce needle miner (Taniva abolineana), and another needle miner, Coleotechnites piceaella (34,43,54). The Cooley spruce gall aphid (Adelges cooleyi) and the pine leaf aphids (Pineus pinifoliae and Pineus similis) cause the formation of cone-shaped galls. The former may be of consequence on seedlings and saplings. Other insects that attack blue spruce are the green spruce aphid, Cinara fornacula, and the related Cinara coloradensis, which feed on terminal twigs, as does the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi). Twig beetles, Pityophthorus spp., may attack injured trees. Dendroctonus rufipennis, the spruce beetle, is also found on blue spruce. Ips pilifrons, an engraver beetle which attacks recently downed trees, may deprive the spruce beetle of favorable breeding places, thereby reducing the threat of a spruce beetle outbreak (34,72). Secondary insects are Dryocoetes affaber and the four-eyed spruce beetle (Polygraphus rufipennis). Ambrosia beetles, Gnathotrichus sulcatus, and Trypodendron bivattatum, and the golden buprestid (Buprestis aurulenta), a flatheaded borer, attack the wood. The rust Chrysomyxa pirolata infects the cones of blue spruce. Seed production is not greatly affected by this disease, however, although malformation of the cones may interfere with seed dispersal (67). Seed viability in rust-infected cones may be reduced, but seeds are not totally destroyed. A variety of diseases also attack seedlings, leaves, stems, and roots of blue spruce. Damping-off, caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, kills new seedlings, as does the cylindrocladium root rot, caused by Cylindrocladium scoparium (11,48). Nematodes may reduce root growth of seedlings in nurseries (30,37). Low seedling vigor is also caused by the root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans (48), and snow molds may cause nursery losses during seasons of heavy snow (82). Leucocytospora kunzei (Syn.: Cytospora kunzei) is widespread in northeastern United States and may cause cankers on one-fourth to one-half of the branches of blue spruce. Although usually not fatal, branch loss dramatically reduces the aesthetic value of landscape trees (35,73). Phomopsis occulta causes a tip blight on blue spruce; it is characterized by downward curling and necrosis of expanding shoots, where stem cankers and sap exudate commonly occur (78). Western spruce dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium microcarpum) causes mortality in infected stands two to five times greater than in healthy stands, and heavily infected trees may show a 10-year volume loss of up to 40 percent (61). Three species of Chrysomyxa cause needle rusts and moderate amounts of shedding of new needles on blue spruce. Another needle cast fungus, Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii, damages Christmas tree plantations of blue spruce in the Midwest and the East. Serious damage is not associated with natural stands of this species although the disease was first reported on blue spruce in its native range in Arizona (44,68,89). Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli causes the perennial yellow witches' broom on blue spruce branches; Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, the common kinnikinnik, serves as host of stage 3 of the fungus (70). Armillaria mellea and Inonotus tomentosus both cause root rot, and Phellinus pini, Fomitopsis pinicola, Climacocystis borealis' and Polyporus caesius are common heart rots (48).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,14,1
"Basic information on soils and landforms needed for silvicultural decisions for blue spruce is limited. Both soils and landforms are very complex. Soils are young and vary widely in texture and physical and chemical properties according to the bedrock from which they originate. Glacial deposits, alluvium from streams, and material weathered in place from country rock are predominant, however (2). The pH is 6.8 to 7.2, neutral to slightly alkaline (21,62). The soils on which blue spruce grows naturally are in the order Mollisols and, to a lesser extent, in the orders Histosols and Inceptisols. Blue spruce is found on gentle upland and subirrigated slopes, in well-watered tributary drainages, extending down intermittent streams, and on lower northerly slopes. Sites on which blue spruce grows are more moist than those of Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum) and warmer than those of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) (2,65). In Utah, blue spruce is considered a pioneer tree species on wet soils (21). Blue spruce is characteristically found at elevations from 1830 to 2740 m (6,000 to 9,000 ft) in its northern range and from 2130 to 3050 m (7,000 to 10,000 ft) in its southern range (27,65).",Soils and Topography,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,15,1
"Blue spruce is valued mainly for its appearance. Shortly after the species was discovered in 1861, writers described it as ""a finely shaped tree"" and ""the most beautiful species of conifer,"" alluding to the symmetrical, pyramidal form and the glaucous, bluish or silvery-gray foliage that some trees of the species display. The needle coloration, caused by the presence of surface waxes (76), apparently intensifies with tree age (13,14). These traits of symmetry and blue or silver-gray cast, so common in horticultural plantings, are only occasionally found in natural stands. In nature, trees with similar color tend to occur in small, local populations, suggesting genetic control of the color trait. Blue spruce is widely used as an ornamental, not only in the United States, but in Europe, where it was introduced late in the 19th century. At least 38 cultivars of blue spruce have been named, based primarily on leaf coloration and crown form (3,19) (table 2). Although young blue spruce usually show a pronounced layering of stiff branches, which give it a distinct pyramidal form, the branches begin to droop and the crown becomes thin and irregular as the tree ages. The trunk tapers rapidly, and epicormic shoots commonly develop, giving the tree a ragged appearance. Blue spruce is prized as a Christmas tree, and plantations have been established in its native range and in north-central and northeastern United States.",Special Uses,Blue Spruce,picea,pungens,conifer,16,1
"In its native habitat, bluegum eucalyptus grows in pure stands and in mixture with messmate stringy bark eucalyptus (Eucalyptus obliqua), mountain-ash eucalyptus (E. regnans), manna eucalyptus (E. viminalis), black peppermint eucalyptus (E. amygdalina), and white peppermint eucalyptus (E. pulchella). Although, for the most part, it has been planted in pure plantations in countries where it has been introduced, it has also been planted in mixture. In California, it has most commonly been mixed with forest redgum eucalyptus (E. tereticornis) and river redgum eucalyptus (E. camaldulensis) (19). In Hawaii, it has been planted in mixture with many other eucalypts. Most of the dense bluegum eucalyptus stands in California and Hawaii are noted for being almost devoid of understory vegetation, except for a few hardy grasses. Although this condition is most likely related to the rather dry climate that provides the best site for the species, it has also been shown that the leaves of the tree produce water soluble phytotoxins that can prevent radicle growth of many herbaceous plants (7). In Hawaii, firetree (Myrica faya) is a species that sometimes invades bluegum eucalyptus stands. The noxious passion fruit vine (Passiflora mollissima) has also been found thriving in a young coppice stand.",Associated Forest Cover,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,1,0
"Although bluegum eucalyptus has great climatic adaptability, the most successful introductions worldwide have been to locations with mild, temperate climates, or to high, cool elevations in tropical areas (8). The ideal climate is said to be that of the eastern coast of Portugal, with no severe dry season, mean annual rainfall 900 min (35 in), and minimum temperature never below -7° C (20° F). In coastal California, the tree does well in only 530 mm (21 in) rainfall accompanied by a pronounced dry season, primarily because frequent fogs compensate for lack of rain. A similar situation is found in Chile where deep fertile soils as well as fogs mitigate the effect of low, seasonal precipitation (8). In Hawaii, bluegum eucalyptus does best in plantations at about 1200 min (4,000 ft) where the rainfall is 1270 mm (50 in) annually and is evenly distributed or has a winter maximum. Seasonality of rainfall is not of critical importance to the species. Although it generally grows well in countries with a Mediterranean or cold season maximum rainfall, it grows well also in summer rainfall climates of Ethiopia and Argentina (8).",Climate,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,2,0
"Natural or controlled hybrids of bluegum eucalyptus with E. blakelyi, E. botryoides, E. cinerea, E. cypellocarpa, E. ovata, E. rudis, E. tereticornis, E. urnigera, and E. viminalis are known (8,14,18).",Hybrids,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,9,0
"Four subspecies are recognized. The type tree, subspecies globulus, is largely confined to the southeast coast of Tasmania but also grows in small pockets on the west coast of Tasmania, on islands in the Bass Strait north of Tasmania, and on Cape Otway and Wilson's Promontory in southern Victoria, Australia (9). Other subspecies are found northward in Victoria and New South Wales (13). The species was introduced into California in 1856 (1) and into Hawaii about 1865 (18) and has become naturalized in both States. It is also fairly common as an ornamental in Arizona but is not naturalized there. In California, it is now primarily used in line plantings along roads and as windbreaks, but formerly, extensive plantations were established. Plantings total about 16 000 ha (40,000 acres) (17). The planted range in California extends from Humboldt County in the north to San Diego County in the south, with best growth in the coastal fog belt in the vicinity of San Francisco. Numerous plantings are seen in the Central Valley from Redding, south through Fresno to Bakersfield, and San Bernardino. Hawaii has about 5000 ha (12,000 acres)-almost all of them on the islands of Hawaii and Maui. In California and Hawaii the tree regenerates within and near the edges of plantations. In some areas of Hawaii it spreads fast enough to be considered a pest by ranchers. Recently, the species has also been planted in its native Tasmania where it is an important pulpwood source (22).",Native Range,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,11,0
"Several previously described species, southern bluegum (E. bicostata Maiden et al.), Maiden's gum (E. maidenii F. Muell.), and E. pseudoglobulus Naudin ex Maiden, have been reduced to subspecies of bluegum eucalyptus (E. globulus ssp. globulus) (12). Steep clines are found in many fruit and vegetative characteristics across the subspecies boundaries, and more gradual changes appear within the ranges of the four subspecies in Australia. The ssp. pseudoglobulus is central, grading on different borders into each of the other three subspecies. The most frost-hardy seedlings originate from populations above 450 m (1,475 ft) elevation in the ranges of ssp. bicostata and ssp. maidenii, but these tend to be the oldest growing (13). Tasmanian bluegum eucalyptus, ssp. globulus, originating near sea level in the southern part of the species range, is the most rapidly growing. Within taxa, drought tolerance of seedlings is associated with populations native to the driest sites. Variation in glaucous bloom of the leaves is correlated with elevation and the ""bluer"" forms are more frost hardy and more drought tolerant than the ""greener"" forms. Variations are known, such as California bluegurn eucalyptus var. compacta (Hort.), a cultivar propagated in the nursery trade for its compact habit and widely used along California highways (2,20).",Population Differences,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,12,0
"Bluegum eucalyptus has a considerable competitive advantage as compared with most other tree species in that its juvenile foliage is seldom browsed by cattle or sheep (8). This condition not only caused it to be a popular tree for planting in open grasslands years ago, but it permits natural seedlings to survive in the presence of grazing animals alongside the planted stands. The tree reproduces by seeding into openings in planted stands and into fields adjacent to plantations. Seed stored in the soil under older stands often germinates prolifically following logging and the resultant natural reproduction interferes with the management of the coppice stand (21). Flowering and Fruiting- Bluegum eucalyptus in California flowers from November to April, the wet season (15). In Hawaii, some trees flower throughout the year, but flowering is heaviest in February to March. The flower buds have a warty cap or operculum about 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter, which falls off, allowing the very numerous stamen filaments to extend in shaving-brush fashion above the cup-shaped base (hypanthium). The yellowish white flowers are pollinated by insects, hummingbirds, and other pollen and nectar feeders. As in almost all eucalyptus, pollen is usually viable before the stigma becomes receptive (8). The fruit, a distinctive top-shaped woody capsule 15 mm (0.6 in) long and 2 cm (1 in) in diameter, ripens in October to March in California, about 11 months after flowering (15). In Hawaii the fruit ripens throughout the year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Bluegum eucalyptus seeds are relatively large for a eucalyptus. There are 18 to 320 seeds per gram (500 to 9,100/oz) of seeds and chaff, or about 460 clean seeds per gram (13,000/oz) (2,5,15). Capsules release seed immediately on ripening and the seed is dispersed by wind. Calculated dispersal distance from a 40-m (131-ft) height, with winds of 10 km/hr (6 mi/hr), was only 20 m (66 ft). Newly released seeds germinate within a few weeks if conditions are suitable. Trees usually begin to produce seeds at 4 to 5 years and yield heavy seed crops in most locations at 3- to 5-year intervals (23). Seeds can be stored for long periods in air-tight containers at 0° to 3° C (32° to 38° F). Seedling Development- Newly germinated seedlings have inverse heart-shaped cotyledons, borne epigeously. The stems of seedlings, especially those grown in the shade, are usually square in cross section, often for as much as 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) of stem length. These square stems usually have prominent ridges or ""wings"" at the corners. Juvenile leaves, which are opposite and broadly lanceolate, 9 by 9 cm (3.5 by 3.5 in), may persist for more than a year (9). Trees in coppice stands 6 rn (20 ft) or mor in height are often entirely in the juvenile leaf form These juvenile leaves bear a bluish gray, waxy bloom and are the reason for the common name of the tree bluegum. Nursery-grown seedlings in containers reach plantable size, about 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) high in 3 to 4 months. Seedlings can be established in planted with bare roots, but success is highly de pendent on favorable wet weather after planting Seedlings are, therefore, usually grown in container and planted with a root ball. Seedlings are not frost resistant (23). With favorable weather conditions on good sites in Hawaii, seedlings that germinate after logging am are not suppressed can be expected to be 1 in (3 ft tall at 6 months, 2 m (6 ft) at 1 year, and 4 m (13 ft at 2 years. Seedlings in four coppice stands in Hawaii grew poorly because they were generally suppressed by coppice shoots from stumps (21). Despite this, an average annual growth of 1.1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at stump height and 1.4 m (4.6 ft) in height was recorded for all seedlings in stands 3, 4, 5, and 6 years old. Stocking of seedlings and coppice shoots in these stands was high, averaging more than 6,000 stems per hectare (2,400/acre). Measurements in six representative planted stands in California that were 5 years or less in age gave an average annual height growth of 2 m (6.7 ft) (19). In Victoria, Australia, unfertilized planted seedlings grew I m (3 ft) annually during a 4-year period, while fertilization of seedlings at three different levels nearly doubled the growth rate (6). Bluegum eucalyptus seedlings show a strong response to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization on many soils (23). Vegetative Reproduction- Bluegum eucalyptus coppices readily from stumps of all sizes and ages. Stumps should be cut 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) high in stands managed for coppice (23). Low-cut stumps do not coppice well from the lignotuber, and coppice stems from stumps cut higher tend to break off easily in the wind. Because the buds that sprout are on the bark side of the cambium and initially weakly connected to the wood of the stump, it is essential that the bark be firmly attached to the stump if coppice stems are to survive. In four coppice stands in Hawaii, ranging in age from 2 to 6 years after logging, annual growth of stump~ coppice averaged 15 mm (0.6 in) in diameter at stump height and 1.8 in (5.9 ft) in height (21). This growth was considerably better than that of seedlings in the same stands referred to earlier. Elsewhere than Hawaii, where foresters have had no experience beyond one rotation, bluegum eucalyptus is normally carried for three coppice rotation after the first, or seedling rotation. Rotations rang from 5 to 10 years in different countries and sites Undesirable shoots are usually removed during the first 2 years of a coppice crop, but thinning is normally not done. In Portugal, coppice stands are some times managed by the system of ""coppice with standards"" so that a sawtimber crop of the straightest an best trees is retained between coppice harvests to b cut as sawtimber when of suitable size (8). In Portugal, coppice rotations are 10 to 15 year with annual yields normally 15 to 20 m/ha (214 t 286 W/acre) (11).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Bluegum eucalyptus is considered a fast-growing tree in most countries where it is used, but a wide range of growth and yield figures are reported in the literature. We know of no data for natural stands in Australia, but some plantations in Tasmania, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory (A.C.T.) have done well (3). In Tasmania, a yield of subspecies globulus at 17 years of 35 m³/ha (500 ft³/acre) per year was reported, with the tallest trees averaging 30 m (99 ft). A plantation of ssp. globulus in Victoria averaged about 20 ern (8 in) in d.b.h. and 18 m (59 ft) in height at 14 years, while another (ssp. bicostata) at Canberra, A.C.T., at age 13 and somewhat lower stocking, averaged 21 cm (8.3 in) in d.b.h. and 15.5 m (51 ft) in height (3). These data are well within the range of those reported for other countries (8). Annual growth in northwestern Spain averages 20 m³ /ha (286 ft³/acre), but in southwestern Spain only 5 to 6 m³/ha (71 to 86 ft³ /acre). In Uruguay, 25 m³/ha (375 ft³ /acre) of annual growth is considered good. In Ethiopia and Portugal, at age 10 on the highest quality site, very good growth is 20 m³/ha (286 Wft³/acre) per year. In California, 67 different stands were measured in 1924 (19). The mean annual growth of all these stands ranging from 2 to 42 years in age, was 19 m³/ha (271 ft³/acre). Ten of these stands, ranging from 13 to 16 years in age and similar to the plantation in Australia, averaged 19.6 cm (7.7 in) in d.b.h., and 20.4 m (67 ft) in height, and had a mean annual growth of 21 m³/ha (300 ft³ /acre). The tallest stand averaged 38.7 m (127 ft) at 23 years. The tallest stand in California is one planted in 1877 on the University of California campus at Berkeley; it contains trees that have been more than 61 rn (200 ft) tall since 1956 (1). In Hawaii, 20 stands ranging in age from 2.5 to 35 years were evaluated in 1911 (18). Four of the stands were in the age range 11 to 20, somewhat similar to the plantations in Australia. In these four, the average d.b.h. was 29.2 cm (11.5 in), and average height was 23 m (76 ft). The tallest stand averaged 30.5 m (100 ft) at 14 years. Seven stands ranging in age from 5 to 20 years had an average annual yield of 20 m³/ha (286 ft³/acre). The tallest bluegurn eucalyptus trees in Hawaii were at Kukaiau Ranch, on the Island of Hawaii, and were about 61 m (200 ft) tall until logged at age 70. Rooting Habit- Bluegum eucalyptus generally does not form a taproot. It produces roots throughout the soil profile, rooting several feet deep on soils that permit it, or shallowly otherwise. On shallow soils, subsoiling to permit greater depth of rooting has markedly improved growth (8). On most trees all the roots are below the lignotuber, but occasionally, adventitious roots result from layering of the stem above the lignotuber. The tree is windfirm by the time it reaches sapling size, but because the root system develops slowly, it can be windthrown when a seedling. Reaction to Competition- Bluegum eucalyptus is generally classed as intolerant of shade and planted stands quickly develop crown differentiation as soon as the crowns close. On sites for which it is best suited, other species cannot compete with it. In Australia, it frequently grows in mixed stands because of microsite variation that favors the competing species that have evolved in the area (23). Although leaves of the species produce water-soluble toxins that may help prevent competition by larger trees (7), one or two maintenance cleanings are usually required shortly after planting to free seedlings from being overtopped by grasses. In Hawaii, sprouts from buried lignotubers often grow as much as 30 cm (12 in) horizontally through litter and grass before emerging to light. Damaging Agents- Although bluegum eucalyptus is seldom browsed by cattle or sheep, seedlings are often severely girdled by rodents. This condition can be prevented by cultivating around the young trees to remove the protective cover the rodents require (19). Although grazing animals do not eat the trees, they do trample them and should be excluded from young plantations. In California, bluegum eucalyptus stands are highly susceptible to fire during the dry season. The bark, which hangs in strips from the stems, readily carries fire into the crowns, and the leaves contain volatile oils that produce a hot fire. Trees are rarely killed by fire, however, as they sprout vigorously from the stems and bases (8). In the moister climate of Hawaii, fire has not been a problem in bluegum eucalyptus stands. Seedlings are intolerant of frost and temperatures of -5° to -10° C (23° to 14° F) usually kill them. Frost resistance increases with maturity, juvenile foliage being less resistant than mature foliage (4). In 1972 a severe frost in the hills of Berkeley, CA, completely defoliated most of the mature bluegum eucalyptus. The trees were considered dead by several authorities and a salvage logging program was started to remove the fire hazard. A few months later, most of the ""dead"" trees sprouted from the stems and bases and began to grow again. This sprouting was judged undesirable and several experiments were undertaken aimed at preventing it. The most successful treatment found was to flood axe frills made at the tree bases with a 0.36 kg/1 (3 lb/gal) solution of glyphosphate in water (10). This permanently killed the trees. The tree is susceptible to drought, particularly on shallow soils. On such soils, subsoiling has been used effectively to permit deeper rooting and to overcome drought susceptibility. Several insects attack bluegum eucalyptus, although none has been a serious problem in California or Hawaii. One that is common in many parts of the world is the wood borer, Phoracantha semipunctata, which has caused severe damage in South Africa and Western Australia. A scale insect, Eriococcus coriaceus, has caused high mortality in New Zealand. Several defoliating insects in the genera Gonipterus, Chrysophtharta, and Mnesampela, attack the species. Fungi have generally not been a severe problem with bluegum eucalyptus. Damping off in nurseries caused by Botrytis cinerea has been a problem but is easily controlled. Pythium and Rhizoctonia spp. have also caused damping-off in containers and flats, particularly when old seed was used (16). Fusarium spp. have destroyed quantities of stored seed in Spain. Attack by Diplodia and Armillaria has been reported from several countries, but neither disease is considered serious (8,23).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,14,0
"Bluegum eucalyptus grows well on a wide range of soils. It requires good drainage, low salinity, and a soil depth of about 0.6 in (2 ft) or more. Other limiting factors are few (8). In locations with a pronounced dry season, such as California, the tree grows best on deep alluvial soils because of the greater moisture supply. In Hawaii, the tree grows very well on Typic and Hydric Dystrandepts, soils of the latosolic brown forest great soil group. These soils are generally 0.9 in (3 ft) deep, acid in reaction, and formed on volcanic ash. In California, the tree grows well on a much wider range of soils than in Hawaii, from the Ultisols and Alfisols developed on deeply weathered sedimentary deposits and sandstone to Inceptisols and Aridisols developed on a wide variety of parent materials. In Portugal, almost 15 percent of the land area is planted to this species. Most stands are on soils developed from sandstone and limestone, which have been badly degraded by cultivation since ancient times. Best yields occur on the heavy texture clay-loams and clays (11).",Soils and Topography,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,15,0
"Bluegum eucalyptus is one of the world's most valuable windbreak trees because of its windfirmness and the unpalatable nature of its seedlings to grazing animals (8,18,19). Because of its ability to sprout along the stem, it can be hedged, thereby making effective sight and sound barriers along highways. The horticultural variety compacta is a dwarf form widely used along California freeways. Bluegum eucalyptus windbreaks are most effective with an understory or adjacent planting of smaller trees and shrubs (20). The species is a major source of fuelwood in many countries of the world primarily because of its ability to coppice after cutting. The wood burns freely, leaves little ash, and produces good charcoal (8). The tree shows promise for use as industrial fuelwood in place of oil. Closely spaced and fertilized plantings in Victoria, Australia, produced mean annual increments of 9 to 14 metric tons per hectare (4 to 6 tons/acre) dry weight of stem wood during a 4-year period (3). In Hawaii, untended 3- to 6-year-old coppice stands average stem wood dry weights of 5 to 7 t/ha (2 to 3 tons/acre) per year. One stand, during its fifth year of growth, produced 14 t/ha (6 tons/acre). Another, during its second year, produced 8 t/ha (3.6 ton/acre) (20). Bluegurn eucalyptus is much used for pulpwood, particularly so because its bark, acceptable in most pulping processes, adds greatly to the yield. It is used mostly for bleached products made by sulfate, sulfite, or bisulfite processes (8). Other uses include the extraction of essential oils from the leaves, honey production from the flowers (that are also good pollen sources), plantings for erosion control, and roadside plantings to provide a noise and headlight buffer (8). Because the wood is heavy and shrinks greatly in drying, it is unsuitable for lumber. Sawing of logs is difficult and the quality of lumber is poor because of growth stress problems. Main uses of bluegurn eucalyptus are for mining timber, fence posts, and poles (23). In South America, the straight, uniform poles are used extensively in construction (17). Lumber and veneer are produced on a fairly large scale in Portugal and Spain where the wood is used for cooperage, furniture, and flooring (8). A small amount of lumber used to be produced in Hawaii.",Special Uses,Bluegum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,globulus,hardwood,16,0
"Brewer spruce grows with a wide variety of associated plants and vegetation types in the montane and subalpine forests of the Klamath region. Although it grows throughout the region, its range is one of local, disjunct populations of various sizes. In some areas, it is an occasional climax tree species in mixed stands dominated by California red fir (Abies magnifica), white fir (A. concolor), or mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). In other areas, it grows in small, pure, dense stands on north-, east-, and west-facing slopes. It is also found as individuals invading seral pine stands and montane chaparral. In the Siskiyou Mountains' Brewer spruce seedlings and saplings are found in montane chaparral on all aspects. It is associated with Sadler oak Quercus sadleriana), huckleberry oak (Q. vaccinifolia), and greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula). Some of the best-developed stands of Brewer spruce are located on moderate east- and west-facing slopes with, deep soil. These forests in the California red fir/Sadler oak habitat have a 70 to 80 percent canopy cover.

"The range of Brewer spruce is primarily influenced by the maritime climate of the Pacific Ocean: cool, wet winters and warm, relatively dry summers. The climate changes drastically, however, from west to east across the range of Brewer spruce, which is 113 km (70 mi). On the most westerly ridge occupied by Brewer spruce, average annual precipitation is more than 2800 mm (110 in); farther east, it is less than 1000 mm (39 in). Most of the precipitation falls as winter rain or snow; less than 5 percent occurs in the summer. The amount of -snowfall and accumulated snowpack varies greatly from year to year and geographically across the range. A few stands of Brewer spruce in valleys receive no snow some years, whereas other stands accumulate up to 4 to 5 m (13 to 16 ft) (5). Humidity is high in the western part of the range and relatively low in the eastern part. Summer fog is common along the western-most ridges and valleys. Summer thunderstorms are common in the eastern portion of the range. Temperatures also vary widely. In the western portion, the mean temperature in January is 5° C (41° F); in July, 11° C (52° F). On the eastern edge of the range, the mean temperature is -1° C (30° F) in January and 20° C (68° F) in July. The varied climate indicates that Brewer spruce has an ecological amplitude that should enable it to obtain a wider and more contiguous distribution. Its sensitivity to fire seems to have restricted its range (13).",Climate,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,2,1
"Little if any variability has been observed throughout the restricted range of Brewer spruce. In the eastern Klamath area, Brewer spruce grows adjacent to Engelmann spruce without hybridization (12).",Genetics,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,7,1
"Brewer spruce is found only in the mountains of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon near the Pacific coast between latitudes 40° 50' N. and 42° 40' N. The best developed stands are on the high ridges of the western Siskiyou Mountains in California and Oregon. Other concentrations are found on high ridges and in upper valleys of the Marble, Salmon, and Trinity Mountains of California (7). Throughout the rest of the range, Brewer spruce grows as a single tree and as scattered small populations in valleys and on ridgetops (9,12,16). - The native range of Brewer spruce",Native Range,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Brewer spruce is monoecious. Strobilus buds form in early summer and develop in the fall. The dark purple male strobili are borne the following spring in axils of needles of the previous year's shoots, on branches throughout the tree. The pollen-bearing strobili are from 19 to 32 mm, (0.75 to 1.25 in) long and about 13 mm (0.5 in) in diameter. Pollen is shed in early summer; the male strobili dry and fall soon after pollen is shed. Female strobili are borne at the tips of primary branches in the upper two-thirds of the crown. They develop into erect, dark green, cylindrical conelets that are 38 mm (1.5 in) long and 13 mm (0.5 in) thick when receptive. The female conelets are apparently receptive at the time pollen is shed. The location of female and male flowers throughout the tree, concurrent with timing of strobilus development, apparently encourages selfing of Brewer spruce located singly or in small, isolated stands. After pollination, the conelets turn down and mature the same season into dark brown cones 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) long. The fruit matures from September to October; dissemination immediately follows. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production starts when the trees are from 20 to 30 years old. Actual production has not been determined. Observations indicate that mature Brewer spruce trees are fair seed producers; crops occur at 2-year intervals, and some trees produce cones each year. The seeds are 3 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) long; the wing is four times as long as the seed. The seeds are the largest of the North American spruces: 134,500/kg (61,000/lb), with a range of 112,500 to 163,000/kg (51,000 to 74,000/lb). The relatively large wing aids dissemination of the seed by the wind. Cones and seeds do not appear to be a preferred food for rodents. Seeds may be stored for 5 to 17 years in sealed containers at low temperatures, 1° to 3° C (33° to 38° F), at a moisture content of 4 to 8 percent. A cold, moist stratification of 30 days increases germination. Germination of sound seed ranges from 50 to 96 percent; the reported average is 88 percent (15). Seedling Development- The germination of Brewer spruce is epigeal, seedlings becoming established on all types of natural seedbeds: decaying logs, forest humus, loose soil from upturned roots, and leaf litter under brush fields. Throughout the range of Brewer spruce, natural regeneration is abundant under dense Brewer spruce-white fir stands. These stands contain an average of 1,360 Brewer spruce and 3,460 white fir seedlings per hectare (550 and 1,400/acre) less than 15 cm (6 in) in height. Brewer spruce seedlings cannot survive strong sunlight. The shallow, slow-growing root system causes the seedlings to be susceptible to the high moisture stress and temperatures of exposed sites. Brewer spruce seedlings are usually lacking in clearcuts, even when these are adjacent to stands containing large cone bearing trees. Seedlings are small, with four to seven cotyledons Initial growth is slow; the epicotyl height growth is less than 6 mm (0.24 in) the first season. Subsequent growth of seedlings is slow but quite variable. Under dense stands, the age of seedling 1.37 m (4.5 ft) tall ranges from 27 to 82 years Brewer spruce seedlings growing in south-facing montane chaparral were from 25 to 40 years old when they were 1.37 m (4.5 ft) tall. Small Brewer spruce survive overstory removal. Vegetative Reproduction- Layering has no been observed in natural stands of Brewer spruce Artificial propagation is best from seed (10).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- After the seedling stage height growth of Brewer spruce is slower than its common associates, Douglas-fir, white fir, red fir, and western white pine. In several stands in the Siskiyou Mountains, annual height growth of sapling and pole-size Brewer spruce averaged 0.15 m (0.5 ft). Most mature stands of Brewer spruce consist of a wide range of ages and sizes. Numerous stands contain Brewer spruce up to 117 cm (46 in) in diameter, the largest 125 cm (49.3 in) in d.b.h. and 48.8 m (160 ft) in height. The biggest Brewer spruce listed by the American Forestry Association (1) has a circumference of 4.17 m (13.67 ft) at 1.37 m (4.5 ft) above the ground and is 51.8 m (170 ft) tall; it is located in the Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon. The general structure of a mixed species, all-aged stand (Sadler oak habitat type) is shown in table 1. Little volume or yield information is available for these Brewer spruce stands. The total basal area of the few stands sampled averages 47 m²/ha (205 ft²/acre), with a current annual increment of 2 m²/ha (9 ft²/acre) (15). Rooting Habit- Brewer spruce has a shallow root system on all soils; however, on deeper soils, a few vertical roots may extend several meters in depth. Reaction to Competition- Brewer spruce is tolerant of shade at all ages and is very competitive. In the Abies magnifica zone on mesic to xeric sites, it is more competitive than mountain hemlock, Port-Orford-cedar, white fir, Douglas-fir, Alaska-cedar, incense-cedar, sugar pine, western white pine, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and Jeffrey pine. California red fir is considered slightly more competitive on mesic sites because of its faster height growth and longer lifespan. Brewer spruce is well adapted to growth at cool temperatures during the growing season. Its light compensation point is less than 2 percent of full sunlight. Brewer spruce can withstand considerable soil drought but is extremely sensitive to high evaporation demands. The stomata close under high evaporation, halting photosynthesis (17). Brewer spruce is best managed on mesic sites characterized by the presence of Sadler oak. It grows best in mixed-species stands with uneven-aged management. Brewer spruce can be planted under montane chaparral dominated by Sadler oak, huckleberry oak, and greenleaf manzanita. It has the ability to grow well under competition for soil moisture and light. Damaging Agents- The shallow root system of Brewer spruce makes it more susceptible than its associates to windthrow. In some areas, the high incidence of root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) further lowers its resistance to wind. Thin bark and long weeping branches make Brewer spruce susceptible to fire. Areas predictably occupied by Brewer spruce are limited to fire-resistant open forests on north-facing slopes or rocky ridges. A series of major forest fires in 1987 burned throughout the range of Brewer spruce. Most of the small, pure stands on north slopes were not damaged. In the more prevalent mixed stands, low-intensity ground fires killed the Brewer spruce and white fir, but the thick-barked Douglas-fir, pines, and California red fir survived. The recovery of Brewer spruce may take decades or centuries because of the extent of these fires. The increased potential of forest fires and inability of Brewer spruce seedlings to tolerate high moisture stress may result in its rapid extinction. If global warming occurs (11), it could threaten the existence of localized tree species such as Brewer spruce. As a small tree, Brewer spruce has enough flexibility to bend under the weight of heavy snow. It develops a pistol butt as the tree matures. Comparatively little damage from insects or fungi has been recorded for Brewer spruce (3). The Cooley spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi) is common but does little damage (6). Seed chalcids (Megastigmus spp.) have been observed in mature seeds. In some areas, 36 percent of the Brewer spruce was parasitized by the dwarfmistletoe Arceuthobiumcampylopodum (8). Brewer spruce is intolerant of industrial fumes.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,14,1
"Brewer spruce grows on a wide variety of geologic parent materials and soils. It is found on soils developed from sedimentary, granitic, serpentine, and metavolcanic rocks. Most of the large stands of Brewer spruce are found on shallow, rocky, undeveloped soils of the order Entisols; a few stands are on deeper, well-developed soils. Throughout its range, Brewer spruce is never found in areas where the soils are saturated during the growing season. It appears to be generally restricted from the more fertile soils by competition from true firs (Abies spp.). Brewer spruce is more abundant on less fertile soils. Brewer spruce is found on most topographic locations-ridgetops, north- and south-facing slopes, benches, and valley bottoms. The only habitat restriction is boggy or wet areas. The apparently preferred location is the steep, north-facing slopes where the largest stands are located. In the western Siskiyou Mountains, these locations are north slopes near the tops of the ridges, but in the eastern Salmon Mountains, the largest stands are on middle, north-facing slopes. Brewer spruce is found from elevations of 700 to 2100 in (2,300 to 6,900 ft) in the western Siskiyou Mountains and from 1370 to 2290 in (4,500 to 7,500 ft) in the eastern Klamath region.",Soils and Topography,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,15,1
"The wood of Brewer spruce has no special uses. Harvested trees are normally mixed with other species and utilized as low grade lumber. In Europe, it has been considered one of the most popular of all ornamental conifers (10).",Special Uses,Brewer Spruce,picea,breweriana,conifer,16,1
"Because of its tolerance to a wide range of soil and moisture conditions, bur oak is an associate of many other trees. In pure or nearly pure stands, it forms the forest cover type Bur Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 42, eastern forests; Type 236, western forests) (6). It is also an important associate in six other types: Northern Pin Oak (Type 14), Aspen (Type 16), Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39), White Oak (Type 53), Pin Oak-Sweetgum (Type 65), and Hawthorn (Type 109). In southern bottom-land cover types such as Pin Oak-Sweetgum, important associates of bur oak are pin oak (Quercus palustris), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), American elm (Ulmus americana), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), willow oak (Q. phellos), overcup oak (Q. lyrata), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii), swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii), white oak (Q. alba), shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa), and shagbark hickory (C. ovata). Associated shrubs and vines on these sites include possumhaw (Ilex decidua), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and trumpetcreeper (Campsis radicans). In more northerly bottom-land types, such as Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple, important associates of bur oak include black ash (Fraxinus nigra), American elm, red maple, American basswood (Tilia americana), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), swamp white oak, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides). Common shrub associates include speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), vacciniums (Vaccinium spp.), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), and poison-sumac (Toxicodendron vernix). Important associates of bur oak in the cover type White Oak include northern red oak (Quercus rubra), black oak (Q. uelutina), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), and post oak (Q. stellata), mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa), pignut hickory (C. glabra), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). In this type, associated shrubs and vines include vacciniums, sumacs (Rhus spp.), witch-hazel (Hamamelis uirginiana), wild grape (Vitis spp.), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), and poison-ivy. On the drier sites in the northwestern part of its range, bur oak grows in mixed stands of American elm, green ash, bitternut hickory, and white oak, and sometimes as nearly pure oak stands. In North Dakota, for example, the cover type Bur Oak accounts for about 19 percent of the forest land. Bur oak is also the major tree of oak savannas (""oak openings"") of the prairie-forest transition zone in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois (3,5,8,12). Shrubs are especially abundant in the bur oak forest of the plains region. Predominant among them are American hazelnut (Corylus americana), coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus), and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra); common associates on the prairie borders are hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), wolfberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis), and prairie crabapple (Malus ioensis).",Associated Forest Cover,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,1,0
"Bur oak is one of the most drought resistant of the North American oaks. In the northwestern part of its range, the average annual precipitation is as low as 380 mm (15 in). Here, the average minimum temperature is 4° C (40° F), and the average growing season lasts only 100 days. To the south bur oak grows in areas having an average precipitation exceeding 1270 mm (50 in) per year, minimum temperatures of -7° C (20° F), and a growing season of 260 days. The best development of the bur oak occurs in southern Illinois and Indiana, where the average annual precipitation is about 1140 mm (45 in), minimum temperature is -29° C (-20° F), and the growing season is 190 days (5).",Climate,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,2,0
"Bur oak has been known to hybridize with nine species as follows: white oak, Q. x bebbiana Schneid.; swamp white oak, Q. x schuettei Trel.; Gambel oak (Q. gambellii); overcup oak, Q. x megaleia Laughlin; swamp chestnut oak, Q. x byarsii Sudw.; chinkapin oak (Q. muehlenbergii), Q. x deamii Trel.; English oak (Q. robur); post oak, Q. x guadalupensis Sarg.; and live oak (Q. uirginiana). The cross with white oak, Q. x bebbiana, Bebb oak, is one of the most frequent of the white oak hybrids and is widespread within the overlapping ranges of the two species (9). The hybrid formed with Gambel oak, a western species, is somewhat unusual in that the two species do not now have overlapping ranges (15).",Hybrids,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,9,0
"Bur oak is widely distributed throughout the Eastern United States and the Great Plains. It ranges from southern New Brunswick, central Maine, Vermont, and southern Quebec, west through Ontario to southern Manitoba, and extreme southeastern Saskatchewan, south to North Dakota, extreme southeastern Montana, northeastern Wyoming, South Dakota, central Nebraska, western Oklahoma, and southeastern Texas, then northeast to Arkansas, central Tennessee, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. It also grows in Louisiana and Alabama. -The native range of bur oak.",Native Range,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,11,0
"A northern form of bur oak, Quercus macrocarpa var. olivaeformis, has been recognized (5). Acorns of this form often germinate in the spring following seedfall rather than soon after falling, and germination is improved by stratification. Acorn size is about half that of the southern form, and the cup is much thinner and smaller. Cleaned seeds average 595/kg (270/lb) compared to only 165/kg (75/lb) for the typical species (16). Where the two forms are found in the same locality, as in eastern Nebraska, the typical bur oak is more common on the moister sites (5,13). Varietal crosses occur in such areas. Photoperiodic ecotypes of bur oak have also been recognized. In one study, shoot growth of a more northerly seed source was about two-thirds of that of a more southerly seed source under short days; under long days, shoot growth of both sources was nearly equal (24).",Population Differences,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Bur oak is monoecious; male and female flowers in separate catkins are home on the current year's branchlets. It flowers shortly after the leaves appear, from about the first of April in the southern part of its range to about mid-June in the north (5). Pollen from one tree appears to germinate better on the stigmas of another, favoring cross pollination. Seed Production and Dissemination- The acorns ripen within the year and drop from the tree as early as August or as late as November. Germination usually occurs soon after seedfall, but acorns of some northern trees may remain dormant through winter and germinate the following spring (5). Bur oaks bear seed up to an age of 400 years, older than reported for any other American oak. The minimum seed-bearing age is about 35 years, and the optimum is 75 to 150 years (5,16). Good seed crops occur every 2 to 3 years, with no crops or light crops in intervening years. The acorns are disseminated by gravity, by squirrels, and to a limited extent by water. Seedling Development- Various conditions influence seedling development (5). In Iowa uplands, germination of acorns and early development of bur oak were best where litter had been removed. Germination is hypogeal (16). When covered by litter, acorns were most susceptible to pilferage by rodents, and the newly developed seedlings were more liable to fungus and insect attack. In a Nebraska study, about 30 percent of acorns germinated within 1 month after seedfall, and the new seedlings were less susceptible to freezing than those of white oak. Under controlled environment, bur oak seedlings grew fastest at a daytime temperature of 310 C (880 F) and a nighttime temperature of 19° C (66° F) (23). The relatively high daytime temperature and a high (70 percent) relative humidity were necessary to obtain more than one flush of shoot growth during the first growing season. When grown under continuous light, bur oak also produced a greater number of shoot flushes than under normal light (19). As a bottom-land species, bur oak is relatively intolerant of flooding, and a mesic, fertile environment is required for seedling establishment (11,14). In open bottom lands, reproduction of bur oak may be prolific, but first-year mortality may be 40 to 50 percent when seedling submersion is 2 weeks or longer during the growing season. For shorter periods of growing-season submersion, seedling mortality is only about 10 to 20 percent. Although bur oak seedlings can endure flooding for up to 30 consecutive days during the growing season, root growth is greatly reduced, thus reducing drought tolerance after flood waters have receded (22). Bur oak seedlings have also been found to be efficient users of water, based on studies of the ratio of transpiration resistance to C02 uptake resistance (25). In this characteristic, it was slightly exceeded by black oak but was more efficient than northern red oak, white oak, and sugar maple for leaf temperatures up to 35° C (95° F). The large number and area of stomata per unit leaf area in bur oak are associated with potentially high transpiration rates (4). Root growth of juvenile bur oaks is rapid, and the taproot penetrates deeply into the soil before the leaves unfold. At the end of the first growing season, bur oak roots have been found at depths of 1.37 m (4.5 ft), with a total lateral spread of 76 cm (30 in). This strong early root development, along with high water-use efficiency, may explain why bur oak can pioneer on droughty sites and can successfully establish itself in competition with prairie shrubs and grasses (5). Vegetative Reproduction- Vigorous sprout growth follows the burning or cutting of pole-size or smaller bur oaks; but except for seedling sprouts, the quality and form of sprout stems are poor. Some sprout growth is also produced by larger trees, but the effect of size and age of parent tree on sprouting vigor and quality has not been determined (5). Five years after prescribed burning in Minnesota, 60 percent of bur oaks 10 to 41 cm (4 to 16 in) d.b.h. had produced sprouts. Sprouts occurred in clumps averaging 21 live stems and the three tallest live stems per clump averaged 2.5 m (8.2 ft) tall (18).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Bur oak is a slow-growing tree (5). In 12- to 16-year-old plantations on Iowa upland sites, average annual height growth ranged from 0.09 to 0.52 m (0.3 to 1.7 ft) and diameter growth from less than 2.5 to 6.4 mm (0.1 to 0.25 in). In the shelterbelts of the northern Great Plains, an annual height growth of about 0.3 m (1 ft) was reported for trees kept under clean cultivation. In Iowa, 10-year d.b.h. growth of bur oak averaged 3.0 cm (1.2 in) for 10- to 20-cm (4- to 8-in) trees, 3.6 cm (1.4 in) for 25- to 36-cm (10- to 14-in) trees, 4.6 cm (1.8 in) for 41- to 51-cm (16- to 20-in) trees, and 5.6 cm (2.2 in) for trees 56 cm (22 in) and larger. More rapid growth has been reported in Kansas where trees 35 to 40 years old averaged 2.5 cm (I in) growth in d.b.h. in 3.8 years. Approximately the same growth rate has been observed in the northern Mississippi Delta region. Bur oak is said to have reached a height of 52 m (170 ft) and a d.b.h. of 213 cm (84 in) in the lower Ohio Valley. On the better sites, mature trees generally grow 24 to 30 in (80 to 100 ft) tall, 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in) in d.b.h., and live 200 to 300 years. Characteristically, they have a massive, clear trunk and a broad, open crown of stout branches. In the oak openings of southern Wisconsin and in the prairie border areas to the south and west, bur oak often is found in nearly pure stands (3,5). The trees are widely spaced, short-boled, and often uniform in size. Trees in a 50- to 65-year-old stand in eastern Nebraska were 9 to 12 in (30 to 40 ft) tall and spaced at intervals of 3 to 12 in (10 to 40 ft). Bur oak grows 21 in (70 ft) tall on the fertile soils in this region, but on dry, limestone ridges, the trees may be less than 7.6 in (25 ft) tall at 150 years of age. In Minnesota, bur oak is short lived on the poorer sites. Timber volumes in the bur oak type of Iowa were estimated to be 15.4 m³/ha (1,100 fbm/acre), three-fourths of which were bur oak. Rooting Habit- In the sapling stage, taproot development continues to be rapid, with abundant lateral growth as well. The taproots of 8-year-old saplings in upland clay soils of Missouri were more than 4.3 in (14 ft) long, and primary laterals extended up to 3.4 in (11 ft) (5). In prairie areas, roots of bur oak and hackberry have been found at depths of 3 to 6 in (10 to 20 ft); and a 43-year-old bur oak tree had a lateral spread of 12.5 in (41 ft) although the tree was only 6 in (20 ft) tall. A study of a tree 36 cm (14 in) in d.b.h. revealed that the weight of the roots equaled that of the tops, and root volume was only about 10 percent less than top volume. Reaction to Competition- Bur oak is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade (5). Some consider it more tolerant than northern red and white oaks; but on the prairie margins, bur oak stands are often invaded by black oak, white oak, and bitternut hickory. Bur oak reproduction in old white pine-bur oak stands in Minnesota reaches only sapling size before dying from suppression, and these stands are being replaced by maple-basswood communities. In the wet bottom lands of northern Ohio, bur oak is a secondary species in the cover type Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple, together with shellbark hickory, green ash, white ash (Fraxinus americana), pin oak, and swamp white oak. On the better drained bottom lands, bur oak may be successfully replaced by more tolerant species such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American basswood, and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). On the prairie edges, bur oak is a pioneer tree, commonly succeeded by northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), black oak, white oak, and bitternut hickory. The climax trees on these sites are sugar maple and basswood or sugar maple and beech. Bur oak may be a climax tree with hickory on extremely dry southern aspects and on thin, stony soils. In general, it is a species well adapted to sites ranging from droughty to moderately wet. But, on any given site, it is largely restricted to plant communities in early successional stages (17). Damaging Agents- Bur oak is attacked by several insects including the following defoliators: redhumped oakworm (Symmerista canicosta) in the Northeast, S. albifrons in the South, oak webworm (Archips fervidana), oak skeletonizer (Bucculatrix recognita), a leaf miner (Profenusa lucifex), variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), June beetles (Phyllophaga spp.), and oak lacebug (Corythucha arcuata) (1,5). The latter species may heavily defoliate bur oaks in shelterbelt plantings, especially during dry weather. Attacks from bur oak kermes (Kermes pubescens) may distort leaves and kill twigs of bur oak. Oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) is a less serious problem in bur oak than in members of the red oak group (5,10). Although spread of the disease from infected bur oak to adjacent oaks is infrequent, the disease sometimes spreads through root grafts, and entire groves have been killed by the gradual expansion of the disease from one center of infection. Bur oak is susceptible to attack by the cotton root rot (Phymatotrichum omnivorum) and Strumella canker (Strumella coryneoidea). Half of the trees in a 20-year-old plantation in Pennsylvania became infected with the latter disease; and nearly a fourth of these died. Other fungi that have been isolated from diseased parts of bur oak include Dothiorella canker and dieback (Dothiorella quercina), Phoma canker (Phoma aposphaerioides), Coniothyrium dieback (Coniothyrium truncisedum), and shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea). Large bur oak trees are resistant to injury by fire and this, together with resistance to drought and disease, probably account for maintenance of the bur oak ""openings"" over much of southern Wisconsin at the time of homesteading. The presence of large bur oaks in the sugar maple-basswood community of the Big Woods of Minnesota has been attributed to the tree's thick fire-resistant bark, which enabled it to survive repeated burning and freed it from competition by less fire-resistant species (5). In the northwest part of its range, bur oak is considered a drought-resistant tree. During severe drought conditions in Iowa, unpastured bur oak stands on dry, exposed slopes were not injured; however, in pastured woods, drought injury occurred, even on protected sites. This was attributed to reduced aeration (caused by trampling) that had limited the growth and efficiency of absorbing roots. Bur oak is not resistant to flooding, and in two areas where it was permanently flooded it died within 3 years. The species tolerates urban pollution better than most oaks.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,14,0
"Bur oak on uplands is often associated with calcareous soils. In the ""driftless"" area of southwestern Wisconsin, it is commonly found on limestone ridges; in Kentucky, it is more prevalent on limestone soils than on soils derived from shales and sandstone (5). In western Iowa, it can be found as a dominant on soils of either limestone or sandstone origin. Throughout much of the prairie region of the Midwest, bur oak is found on droughty sandy plains, black prairie loams, and on loamy slopes of south and west exposure. Toward the western edge of its range, such as in eastern Kansas, it is more abundant on the more moist north-facing slopes than on southfacing slopes (2). Bur oak often dominates severe sites with thin soils, heavy claypan soils, gravelly ridges, and coarse-textured loessial hills. The predominant soil orders on which bur oak is found include Alfisols in the central and southern parts of its range, and Mollisols and Spodosols in the western and northern parts of its range, respectively. Bur oak is also an important bottom-land species throughout much of its range. In the Central States Region and southward, it is found on moist flats and on hummocky bottoms. Northward, in southern Michigan, it has been found in high densities on slightly elevated ridges within wet bottom-land forests occupying old glacial lake beds and drainage ways (20). Bur oak frequently forms a fringe between the prairie and upland forest in northern Illinois and eastern Iowa, notably at the outer edges of ""breaks"" and bluffs along streams and around limestone outcrops. It is a valuable timber species on favorable bottom-land sites within this region. Within the Great Plains Region, it is frequently found in stream bottoms and stream terraces. In North Dakota, bur oak is a major component of the flood-plain forests of the Missouri River (11). Here it may predominate in old stands on high terraces near the edge of the flood plain. It is absent in low terraces near the center of the flood plain. Along adjacent draws and upper slopes, it becomes the first tree established along prairie edges. Bluffs along the Missouri River and its tributaries in eastern Nebraska are frequently covered with bur oaks that range in size from small trees near the base of bluffs to shrublike growth near the top. In the Black Hills of western South Dakota and the Bear Lodge Mountains of northeastern Wyoming, bur oak grows at low elevations between the ponderosa pine forest and the grasslands (21). Here, it ranges in size from a shrub under a pine canopy at higher elevations to a tree up to 21 m (69 ft) tall along stream bottoms at lower elevations.",Soils and Topography,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,15,0
"Acorns of bur oak make up much of the food of red squirrels and are also eaten by wood ducks, white-tailed deer, New England cottontails, mice, thirteen-lined ground squirrels, and other rodents (5). On coal-mine spoils with a pH of 5.6 in eastern Kansas, planted bur oak was one of the better performers of several tree species tested (7). After 22 years, it attained a mean height of 8.5 m (28 ft) and a d.b.h. of 12.2 cm (4.8 in). The species is also widely planted in shelterbelts because of its drought tolerance.",Special Uses,Bur Oak,quercus,macrocarpa,hardwood,16,0
"Butternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest. It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types (5): Sugar Maple-Basswood (Society of American Foresters Type 26); Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 59); Beech-Sugar Maple (Type 60); and River Birch-Sycamore (Type 56). Commonly associated trees include basswood (Tilia spp.), black cherry (Prunus serotina), beech (Fagus grandifolia), black walnut (Juglans nigra), elm (Ulmus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), hickory (Carya spp.), Oak (Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with sweet birch (Betula lenta) and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with white pine (Pinus strobus) (4,15). Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas it may be abundant. In the past, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee have been the leading producers of butternut timber.",Associated Forest Cover,Butternut,juglans,cinerea,hardwood,1,0
"Climatic conditions within the botanical range of butternut vary widely. Mean annual temperature ranges from 16° C (60° F) in Alabama to 4° C (40° F) in New Brunswick, with an average maximum of 41° C (105° F) and minimum of -34° C (-30° F). Annual precipitation ranges from 630 mm (25 in) in southeastern Minnesota to 2030 mm (80 in) in the southern Appalachians. The frost-free period is 210 days in the southern part of the range and 105 days in the northern part (6).

"Butternut is found from southeastern New Brunswick throughout the New England States except for northwest Maine and Cape Cod. The range extends south to include northern New Jersey, western Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, northwestern South Carolina, northern Georgia, northern Alabama, northern Mississippi, and Arkansas. Westward it is found to central Iowa and central Minnesota. It grows in Wisconsin, Michigan, and northeast into Ontario and Quebec. Through most of its range butternut is not a common tree, and its frequency is declining (4). The ranges of butternut and black walnut (Juglans nigra) overlap, but butternut occurs farther north and not as far south as black walnut. -The native range of butternut.",Native Range,Butternut,juglans,cinerea,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Butternut flowers from April to June, depending upon location. The species is monoecious; male flowers are slender catkins that develop from axillary buds and female flowers are short terminal spikes home on current year's shoots. Flowers of both sexes do not usually mature simultaneously on any individual tree (3). The fruit is an oblong-ovoid pointed nut, 3.8 to 5.5 cm (1.5 to 2.2 in) long, that matures in September and October of the year of pollination. Nuts occur singly or in clusters of from 2 to 5. The kernel or seed of the nut is sweet, oily, and edible. The nut is enclosed by an indehiscent husk that contains a glandular pubescence on the surface. The fruit usually remains on the tree until after leaf fall (3). Seed Production and Dissemination- Commercial seed-bearing age begins at about 20 years and is optimum from age 30 to 60 years. Good crops can be expected every 2 to 3 years, with light crops during intervening years. Thrifty trees may yield 9 to 35 liters (0.25 to 1 bushel) of cleaned seeds. A high percentage of mature seeds are sound, but high premature seed losses in butternut have been reported. Possible causes include consumption by insects, birds, and rodents as well as natural pollination failures due to a lack of pollinating trees in the immediate vicinity (4,10,14,21). Upon ripening, seeds are dispersed by gravity and by squirrels and other rodents. At this time, the seeds are dormant. Cold stratification for 90 to 120 days at temperatures of 20° to 30° C (68° to 86° F) overcomes dormancy. Seedling Development- Seeds of butternut usually germinate in the spring following seedfall. Germination is hypogeal. Seedlings develop a taproot on all sites except the most shallow soils, but the taproot is much less pronounced than on black walnut. In general, butternut seedlings have more fibrous root systems than black walnut. Vegetative Propagation- Stumps of young butternut trees and saplings are capable of sprouting. Also, butternut can be propagated by grafting, although the techniques have not yet been perfected. Various degrees of success have been demonstrated with intra-specific as well as inter-specific grafting in the genus (9).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Butternut,juglans,cinerea,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Butternut grows fast, especially as a seedling, although it usually does not live longer than 75 years and is short lived in relation to its common tree associates. Mature trees rarely reach a height of more than 30 m (100 ft) and a d.b.h. of 91 cm (36 in). Average-sized trees are from 12 to 18 m (40 to 60 ft) in height and 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h. (4). Rooting Habit- On favorable sites the root system is deep, but it also may be widespreading. Reaction to Competition- Although young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above. It must be in the overstory to thrive and, therefore, is classed as intolerant of shade and competition. Like other members of the Juglandaceae family, butternut produces a substance called juglone, a naphthoquinone that is selectively toxic to associated vegetation. Greatest concentrations of juglone are in root tissue and fruit husks with lesser amounts in leaves, catkins, buds, and inner bark (12,13). Within its optimum range and on good sites, butternut is usually considered a desirable component of forest stands; it has been classed as a ""less desirable"" tree in southern Appalachian coves (4). Damaging Agents- Insect enemies of butternut are often pests of associated trees as well. Some insects commonly found on butternut include wood borers, defoliators, nut weevils, lacebugs, husk flies, and bark beetles. The most serious insect pest at this time is the butternut curculio (Conotrachelus juglandis), which injures young stems and fruit (8,21). The most serious disease of Juglans cinerea is butternut decline or butternut canker. In the past the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, Melanconis juglandis; but now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum. Symptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1-3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout (19,20). Diseased trees usually die within several years (11,16). The disease is reported to have eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina (1). The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin; between 1978 and 1983 the incidence of butternut canker in a young, isolated plantation increased exponentially from 5 percent in 1976 to 76 percent in 1983 (20). By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease. Bunch disease also attacks butternut. Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a mycoplasmalike organism. Symptoms include a yellow witches'broom resulting from sprouting and growth of axillary buds that would normally remain dormant. Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed. Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut (2,17). The common grackle has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high (14). Butternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally windfirm, it is subject to frequent storm damage (4).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Butternut,juglans,cinerea,hardwood,14,0
"Butternut grows best on streambank sites and on well-drained soils; it is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils. It grows better than black walnut, however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin. Butternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage, primarily on soils of the orders Alfisols and Entisols. It is found up to an elevation of 1500 in (4,900 ft) in the Virginias, at much higher altitudes than black walnut (4,18).",Soils and Topography,Butternut,juglans,cinerea,hardwood,15,0

"In the forest cover type Cabbage Palmetto (Society of American Foresters Type 74), the species usually makes up a plurality of the stocking (11). Because cabbage palmetto can accommodate a wide range of sites, it is found in association with many plant species, especially in south Florida. It is found on severe sites such as dunes, salt flats, barrier islands, cactus thickets, and wet prairies. It is a common component of such diverse communities as freshwater cypress swamps, relic inland dune ridges, and rockland pine forests, where it grows with South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa) and various tropical hardwoods on limestone outcrops. Other coniferous associates include typical slash pine (P. elliottii var. elliottii), pond pine (P. serotina), and loblolly pine (P. taeda) at edges of marshes; longleaf pine (P. palustris) on dry sites such as xeric hammocks; and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) in hydric hammocks. Cabbage palmetto is also a component of both temperate and subtropical hardwoods, which include species such as the various evergreen oaks (Quercus spp.), loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus), redbay (Persea borbonia), magnolias (Magnolia spp.), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), baldcypress (Taxodium spp.), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), cocoplum (Chrysobalanus Waco), Florida strangler fig (Ficus aurea), Florida poisontree (Metopium toxiferum), and wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum). The abundance of cabbage palmetto within a given community is often related to the site's fire history. Cabbage palmetto can survive fires that kill other arborescent vegetation be cause of its deeply embedded bud and fire-resistant trunk; it thus tends to form pure stands with periodic burning (19,27,30). Associated understory vegetation includes gallberry (Ilex glabra), huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp.) blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), lyonias (Lyonia spp.), waxmyrtle (Myrica cerifera), holly (Ilex spp.), saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), bracken (Pteridium spp.), blackberry (Rubus spp.), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), bluestem (Andropogon spp.), sawgrass (Cladium jamaicensis), beak-rush (Rhynchospora spp.), and such epiphytic plants as the common tree orchid (Tillandsia spp.), and various bromeliads in the subtropical hammocks. Several naturalized exotics, namely casuarina (Casuarina spp.), melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), coconut (Cocos nucifera), and Brazil peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia), are now commonly associated with cabbage palmetto-apparently at its expense-but it is too early to judge the extent of their competition.",Associated Forest Cover,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,1,0
"The climate within the natural range of cabbage palmetto is principally subtropical to warm temperate, humid, with an average annual rainfall of 1000 to 1630 mm. (39 to 64 in) and average annual minimum and maximum temperatures from about -4° to 36° C (25° to 97° F). Low winter temperatures apparently limit the horticultural range of the species, which now extends more than 160 km (100 mi) north and inland of its natural range (3).",Climate,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,2,0
"The only available information on varieties pretains to growth differences between seedlings at Smith Island, NC, and Miami, FL.

"Cabbage palmetto is the most widely distributed of our native palm trees. Its range extends northward from the Florida Keys through its epicenter in south-central Florida to Cape Fear, NC. A disjunct population has been reported at Cape Hatteras, NC (16). From North Carolina south to the Florida line it hugs the coastline, usually occurring within 20 km (12 mi) of the ocean. In Florida, its northern boundary turns west through Gainesville and follows an ancient shoreline across the peninsula to the Gulf Coast. It then follows the shoreline westward to St. Andrews Bay where its range is slowly extending (3). Outside the United States, it is found in the Bahama Islands (23). -The native range of cabbage palmetto.",Native Range,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowers are perfect, about 6 mm (0.25 in) in diameter by 3 mm (0.125 in) long, and creamy to yellowish white (19,29). The showy flowers are borne in profusion in arching or drooping clusters 1.5 to 2.5 m (5 to 8 ft) long, from April through August in south Florida but for only a 4- to 6-week period beginning in the middle of July in North Carolina (3,31). The fragrant flowers are pollinated by bees, although other insects may be of local importance (3). The fruits are black, fleshy, drupelike berries, 5 to 13 mm (0.2 to 0.5 in) in diameter and averaging about 10 mm (0.4 in), each containing a single, hard, brown, spherical seed (2,3). Seed Production and Dissemination- The fruits mature in the fall and persist on the spadix until removed by wind, rain, or birds such as ring billed gulls, fish crows, cardinals, and blue jays. Once on the ground, the fruits are eaten by numerous animals or cached by rodents; such caches result in dense patches of seedlings (3,14,19). In near-coast situations, however, the major means of dissemination appears to be by water. The distribution of cabbage palmetto along the Atlantic shoreline is attributed to the seed's buoyancy and tolerance of saltwater. Thus, the range of cabbage palmetto is a function of the speed and direction of estuarine and littoral currents along a shoreline. This fact explains the species spread northward along the Atlantic Coast and its expansion westward along the Gulf Coast (3). Cabbage palmetto produces large numbers of fruits and seeds each year. In a cabbage-palm hammock in southwest Florida, an estimated 1,530,000/ha of ripe fruits (620,000/acre) were produced per year, of which 9 percent contained intact seeds after 6 months, 1 percent were infested by beetles, and 89 percent had been totally consumed or removed from the site (19). Predation of cabbage palmetto seeds by a bruchid beetle (Caryobruchus gleditsiae) is the major cause of seed loss and regeneration failure (3,32). When seeds are carried off by animals, the probability of predation by this insect is greatly reduced. Seeds falling into water also escape this predation because they tend to be covered by sand or organic debris, so that germination occurs when temperature and moisture conditions become favorable. However, infestation of the fruit while still on the tree is substantial and can reach 98 percent (5). Seeds exposed to the sun for long periods do not germinate well (3). Germination of cabbage palmetto seeds is hastened by stratification in moist sand for 30 days at 3° C (37° F) (18). Dormancy is also broken if the micropyle cap is removed. For example, germination of untreated seed was 36 percent in 100 days but was increased to 84 percent or more in 4 days by removal of the micropyle cap (29). Moisture and temperature requirements for germination are satisfactorily met throughout its range. Although the species does not reproduce on the fore dune or beach face, substrate salinity levels encountered on the lee side of dunes or in upper reaches of tidal creeks and marshes do not represent an establishment problem (3). Seedling Development- Germination of cabbage palmetto is hypogeal. Like other palms, it grows upward from a single terminal bud and outward from the fibrovascular bundles distributed throughout its trunk. Because seeds germinate from middle to late summer, seedling growth the first year normally consists of a primary root, one fully expanded leaf with stem growth obliquely downward forming the rhizome. Ecotypic differences between northern and southern seed sources in seedling photosynthetic and biomass growth rates have been observed (3). Vegetative Reproduction- No information available.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Since palms do not have a cambium as such, they do not produce annual growth rings. Cabbage palmetto reaches its maximum development in south-central Florida, but good growth also occurs along the Gulf Coast to the Apalachicola River. Mature trees are straight, unbranched, with heights from 10 to 25 m (33 to 82 ft) and diameters of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) (21). A dense well rounded crown is almost always formed. On many trees the leaf bases or ""boots"" remain securely attached while on others they slough off, leaving a fairly smooth trunk (fig. 3). Diameters are exaggerated when these boots remain attached to the trunk. Average growth rates are unknown. One specimen, planted as an ornamental in south-central Florida, grew to a height of 9 m (30 ft) and a diameter including boots of about 76 cm (30 in) in 16 years (6). Few stand measurements of cabbage palmetto have been made; stem counts, in the rockland pine forest of Everglades National Park (28) and in the sandy marl pine-palm association (4) and the mixed swamp forest of the Big Cypress National Preserve (27), showed cabbage palm to be rather abundant, with stems numbering 900/ha (364/acre), 500/ha (202/acre), and 180/ha (73/acre), respectively. In a cabbage-palm hammock just north of the Big Cypress Swamp, the count of cabbage palmetto was 1,010/ha (409/acre), with a basal area of 53.0 m² /ha (231 ft²/acre); there were 7,150 palm seedlings per hectare (2,895/acre) under breast height (19). Rotting Habit- The underground stem of cabbage palmetto is short and bulbous, surrounded by a dense mass of contorted roots commonly 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) in diameter and 1.5 to 1.8 rn (5 to 6 ft) deep. From this mass, tough, light-orange roots often almost 13 mm (0.5 in) in diameter penetrate the soil for a distance of 4.6 to 6.1 m (15 to 20 ft) (22). Reaction to Competition- Cabbage palmetto is classed as shade tolerant and is probably a climatic climax as well as a fire climax. Since intensive management of cabbage palmetto has not been tried, the effects of various silvicultural treatments are conjectural. But its management would appear to be simple and straightforward, with the tree managed in either pure or mixed stands under either an even-or all-age management system. Damaging Agents- In its native environment, only a rising sea level, hurricanes, and organic soil fires are harmful to this species. It is apparently free of damaging insects and most other pathogens, although bole cankers have been reported (26). Seed predation by the bruchid beetle, as previously discussed, would be a major problem but for the large number of seed produced each year. South of the Tamiami Trail, which crosses the lower part of south Florida, cabbage palmetto mortality is significant because extensive drainage schemes, resulting in a reduced freshwater head, have combined with a rising sea level to produce increased salinities (1,8). Cabbage palmetto has been rated the most wind-resistant south Florida tree but it nevertheless suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Donna in 1960, particularly on Palm Key in Florida Bay (9). Cabbage palmetto growing on organic soil or deep humus deposits are killed by fire burning in this organic layer because of root mortality and loss of mechanical support. The extensive use of these trees in urban landscaping is depleting native stands of mature cabbage palmetto, suggesting a future need to manage stands for this use.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,14,0
"Cabbage palmetto can tolerate a broad range of soil pH, salinity, and drainage but prefers neutral to alkaline soils characterized by near-surface or exposed calcareous sands, marls, or limestone (10,15). Although it grows at the edges of both saline and freshwater areas, it cannot survive lengthy tidal inundations (8) but can withstand fluctuations of 2 m (6 ft) in freshwater levels by developing extensive adventitious rootlets along its trunk up to the high-water mark. This cylindrical root mass may reach diameters of 1.8 to 2.4 rn (6 to 8 ft) (24). In the northern part of its range, cabbage palmetto is primarily found on the bay side of coastal dunes and adjacent mainland. Farther south in Georgia, it extends up the flood plains of major rivers. In central Florida, the tree is often found on fine sandy soils with subsoils of limestone or marl on periodically flooded lowlands, and on relic inland dune ridges below 30 rn (100 ft), an elevation that defines the approximate shoreline of the Wicomico Sea of the Pleistocene (7). With the construction of drainage ditches in south-central Florida, it has colonized the once seasonally inundated interhammock glades. The species is found on a wide range of soils including those in the orders Entisols, Alfisols, Ultisols, and Spodosols in south Florida. Drainage tends to be restricted, ranging from somewhat poorly to very poorly drained. All soils appear to have one characteristic in common, a high calcium content, which is indicated by either a high base saturation (Alfisols) or limestone, phosphatic rock, or sea shells in the profile. Soil series typical of the Alfisols are Boca, Bradenton, Parkwood, and Riviera. Typical Entisols are exemplified by the Pompano series. Charlotte, Oldsmar, and Wabasso soil series are typical Spodosols on which the species is found. The species often forms pure stands up to about 10 ha (25 acres) in freshwater areas, called river hammocks if they lie along a river, and cabbage-palm hammocks or palm savannas if they are on inland prairies.",Soils and Topography,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,15,0
"Cabbage palmetto is so called because of its edible terminal bud which tastes somewhat like that vegetable. The bud, also called swamp cabbage, is good both raw and cooked and is commercially canned and sold. Removal of the bud kills the tree, however. Cabbage palmetto was an important tree to the Seminole Indians, who often made their homes on cabbage-palm hammocks (23). They made bread meal from the fruit, which has a sweet, prunelike flavor, and they used the palm fronds to thatch their chickees (huts) and to make baskets (10,22,25). Many other uses of this tree are documented (17,22,26): pilings for wharfs because they resist attacks by seaworms, stems, hollowed out to form pipes for carrying water, ornamental table tops from polished stem cross-sections, canes, scrub brushes from the bark fibers and leaf sheaths, and logs for cribbing in early fortifications because they did not produce lethal splinters when struck by cannonballs. Currently, young cabbage palmetto fronds are collected and shipped worldwide each spring for use on Palm Sunday. This tree is in flower when many other plants are not and is a significant source of a strong but delicious dark-amber honey. Perhaps the most important uses are as an ornamental and as wildlife food. The sheer magnitude of its annual fruit crop is such that it provides a substantial part of the diet of many animals such as deer, bear, raccoon, squirrel, bobwhite, and wild turkey (12,13, 18, 19, 20).",Special Uses,Cabbage Palmetto,sabal,palmetto,hardwood,16,0
"California black oak is a component of six forest cover types (11). It is the prime constituent of California Black Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 246) and a major component in two others: Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234) and Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244). Black oak becomes important in Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243) and Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245) after severe disturbance or fire. The oak is a minor component in Canyon Live Oak (Type 249). The successional status of California black oak is not clear. It has been implied that the species was climax because the type in which it was a part represented a degree of mesophytism between that of the chaparral and the conifer forest (7). The species was also thought to be more a persistent subclimax than climax. California black oak, or its fossilized equivalent (Quercus pseudolyrata), was much more widespread in past ages than now. Fossil remains indicate that the species was abundant in sedimentary deposits near Spokane and Ellensburg, WA, in the John Day Valley and Blue Mountains of Oregon, and in northwestern Nevada (6). These deposits date back to the Miocene epoch of 12 to 26 million years ago. Increasing aridity is the probable cause for the smaller natural range of black oak today. The most common botanical associate of black oak is ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa). The two species intermingle over vast acreages, except that black oak is found at lower elevations, on sites too poor to support pine, and in certain areas within the redwood region of California where pine does not grow. Another exception is that this oak is rarely found in Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237) (11). In California and Oregon, therefore, where the natural ranges of the two species coincide, ponderosa pine sites generally are fertile ground for black oak. And black oak sites are almost always fertile ground for ponderosa pine. At lower elevations, black oak often serves as a nurse tree to conifers. Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) seedlings often become established beneath the sheltering crowns of large black oaks while adjacent ground remains bare (2). A rule-of-thumb is that black oak never grows through a stand of ponderosa pine but can grow through brush (9). Without disturbance, black oak is eventually crowded out of the best sites and remains only as scattered remnants in mixed-conifer forests. Here it often exists on ""islands"" of soil or terrain not favorable for natural regeneration of conifers. Black oak grows individually or in groves, some of which are quite extensive. Usually each grove is of one age-class, the result of sprouting after fire (34). Rarely does it exist as an understory, especially beneath a closed canopy. The species is usually a component of hardwood stands or of mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii) are the most common hardwood associates of black oak. Other hardwood associates at lower elevations are Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana), interior live oak (Q. wislizenii), coast live oak (Q. agrifolia), Engelmann oak (Q. engelmannii), and blue oak (Q. douglasii). At higher elevations Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), California-laurel (Umbellularia californica), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) intermix with California black oak. Besides ponderosa pine, conifer associates at low elevations are knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata), Monterey pine (P. radiata), Digger pine (P. sabiniana), and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). At intermediate elevations within the natural range of California black oak are California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana), grand fir (A. grandis), incense-cedar, Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), sugar pine (P. lambertiana), giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), Douglas-fir, California torreya (Torreya californica), and bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa). At higher elevations black oak intermingles with western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi). Shrub associates include at least 30 species, some of the most important of which are greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), whiteleaf manzanita (A. viscida), deerbrush (Ceanothus integerrimus), bear-clover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), Brewer oak (Quercus garryana var. breweri), Sierra coffeeberry (Rhamnus rubra), Sierra gooseberry (Ribes roezlii), and poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum). In parts of Shasta and Trinity Counties, and perhaps elsewhere, black oak itself takes a shrub form. The stands so formed usually are dense and tangled-ideal habitat for deer and upland game. Except on the fringe of black oak's natural range, especially at the lowermost elevations, most shrubs generally are not competitive, nor particularly abundant over most of the forest land where black oak grows. After heavy cutting or fire, however, some of the more aggressive shrubs often compete strongly with black oak sprouts. When compared with 15 of its most common shrub associates in the Klamath Mountains of northern California, black oak ranked ninth in need of soil moisture, third in demand on soil nutrients, eighth in terms of tolerance, and first in rapidity of sprouting (32). The species is able to withstand high moisture stress (37) and to become established and grow well on harsh sites where few other species are capable.",Associated Forest Cover,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,1,0
"Hot dry summers and cool. moist winters characterize the climate where California black oak grows. Within the species' natural range, average annual precipitation varies widely. In the valleys of southwestern Oregon, it exceeds 760 mm (30 in); in northwestern California, it ranges from 760 to 2540 mm (30 to 100 in); and in northeastern California, only 300 to 380 mm (12 to 15 in) of rainfall annually. Throughout the range of black oak in north-central and central California, annual precipitation averages 1010 to 1780 mm (40 to 70 in) but may exceed 2920 mm (115 in) locally. In these areas less than 4 percent of the yearly precipitation falls from. June through September. In the mountains of southern California, precipitation averages 910 mm (36 in). Black oak achieves its best size and abundance in areas where snowfall accounts for 10 to 50 percent of the year's precipitation. Average mean daily temperatures range from -1° to 8° C (31° to 46° F) during January, and from 19° to 28° C (66° to 82° F) in July. The last killing spring frost is expected between March 15 and June 9, and the first killing frost in the fall between August 30 and November 30. Periods free of killing frosts range from 82 to 270 days.

Another hybrid, Quercus x chasei (Q. agrifolia x kelloggii) has been described in Monterey and Santa Clara Counties, CA. Of the hybrids, Q. moreha is by far the most widespread, ranging throughout California and even found, though rarely, in south-central Oregon. The tree is distinguished readily in the winter by its sparse evergreen foliage in contrast to the completely deciduous black oak. New leaves in spring form a dense mass of shiny green foliage on the hybrid. Forma cibata, a form by which black oak has been described, is a low shrub common to steep, rocky, talus slopes at higher elevations. Although described as a true shrub form, this status is questionable. No criteria are known for distinguishing between it and scrubby black oak trees.",Genetics,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,7,0
"The north-south range of California black oak is about 1255 kin (780 mi). In Oregon, its natural range extends from just north of Eugene, southward through the valleys west of the Cascade Range. The species is especially frequent along lower slopes in fairly dry sections of the Klamath and Cascade Mountains but never grows near the Pacific Ocean. In California, black oak is found in the northern Coast Range from the Oregon State line to Marin County and then intermittently in the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia Mountains. This oak becomes more common on the San Bernardino, San Jacinto, and Agua Tibia Mountains, extending to just south of Mt. Laguna, and is now recognized as being in Baja California (5). In California's Sierra Nevada, the species grows abundantly along the west side, from near Lassen Peak to near. Kings Canyon. California black oak becomes intermittent southward to the Tehachapi Mountains, where it again increases in abundance. California black oak is generally confined to the westside, but a few stands have been found along the eastside of the Sierra Nevada. The species approaches the Nevada State line northeast of Beckwourth Pass but is not reported in Nevada. -The native range of California black oak.",Native Range,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- California black oak flowers from mid-March to mid-May depending on elevation, physiography, and local climatic conditions. In general, trees near the coast and at lower elevations bloom earliest. Flowers on black oak are unisexual. The plant is monoecious. Staminate flowers are long (3.5 to 7.5 cm or 1.4 to 3.0 in) hairy aments that emerge from buds in the leaf axils of the previous year's growth. The five to nine stamens in each ament have bright red anthers and pale green filaments. The calyx is light green. Pistillate flowers are borne singly or two to seven on a short stalk that originates from leaf axils of the current year's growth. The stigmas are dark red. Acorns mature in the second year. Early in the second summer the immature acorn resembles a small globe about 6 mm (0.2 in) in diameter. At this stage, the acorn is completely encapsulated in the cup. At maturity the light brown, thin-scaled cup encloses from 0.5 to 0.75 of the acorn. Acorns form singly, or in clusters of two to six, and vary widely in dimension. Sizes range from 1.9 to 4.4 cm (0.7 to 1.7 in) long and from 0.9 to 3.8 cm (0.4 to 1.5 in) in diameter. Seed Production and Dissemination- In natural stands, black oak must be 30 years or older before it produces viable seed. The oak produces some acorns sporadically between ages 30 and 75 but seldom large quantities before 80 to 100 years. A few trees bear at least some acorns every year. Others of similar diameter and crown characteristics rarely produce acorns. Trees that are good seed producers continue abundant acorn production at least to 200 years. Age, diameter of bole, and crown width influence acorn yield (22). A general relationship for a medium seed crop on a good forest site is that acorn yield increases as bole and crown diameter increase, at least through age 200: Estimates of acorn production by tree or size of seed crop are scarce. One large, 150- to 200-year-old black oak in Butte County, CA, produced about 6,500 acorns for a crop year rated as fair. Acorns were large and heavy, numbering 115/kg (52/lb). Black oak acorns usually are smaller, numbering between 115 and 324/kg (52 and 147/lb). Large acorns have been observed at both low and high elevations and small acorns at medium elevations. The factors influencing acorn size probably are many, but little is known about their interaction. A single, large, well-developed tree at a low elevation in Shasta County, CA, produced sound acorns each year as follows: The magnitude and periodicity of seed crops appear to be quite variable. One study reported that abundant seed crops for entire stands were produced at 2- to 3-year intervals (31). At 760 m (2,500 ft) elevation in Yuba County, CA, medium to bumper seed crops were produced in 4 of 20 years. At 850 in (2,800 ft) elevation in south-central Shasta County, medium to bumper crops were borne on large black oaks in 4 of 8 years. At a lower elevation in Shasta County (170 m or 560 ft), black oaks yielded sound acorns in 6 of 7 years. Of these, two each rated as bumper, medium, and light. Insects destroy many acorns, primarily in the developmental stage. Immature acorns are attacked by both lepidopterous and coleopterous pests. The filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus) and the filbert weevil (Curculio uniformis) are particularly destructive, in some places infesting up to 95 percent of the acorns and destroying most of a crop (16). Fire may lessen these losses. On the Shasta-Trinity National Forests in California, a prescribed burn in March 1978 resulted in a bumper crop of sound black oak acorns, while trees on unburned ground nearby bore only unsound acorns. Apparently, destructive insects in the duff and soil were reduced greatly by the fire (33). Fully developed acorns begin falling in mid-August at lower elevations, and in mid-September at higher elevations. Almost all acorns that fall first are hollow or infested with insects. Some are still green or greenish yellow. Sound acorns begin dropping from late September to early November and cease by November 15 at lower elevations. At higher elevations almost all acorns have fallen by early December. Acorns generally drop just before or during leaf fall. Once on the ground, temperature can be critical to continued viability, and fallen leaves help keep acorn temperatures below lethal thresholds. In one instance, fully mature acorns exposed to the hot fall sun had withered cotyledons after 9 days. Acorns from the same trees showed full-sized cotyledons after 21 days, if protected by leaves and branches (21). Likewise, cotyledons of acorns exposed to freezing temperatures turned gray and flaccid, although cotyledons of acorns beneath tree crowns and covered with leaves remained white, crisp, and firm. A blue-gray mold also damages fallen seed. At one location, acorns covered for about 2 months by wet leaves showed mold at the blunt ends that had progressed well within the seeds. For other acorns in this same environment, cutting tests showed that cotyledons were unaffected. American Indians, however, gathered only freshly fallen acorns to avoid the mold (15). Because the acorns are large and heavy, most fall directly beneath tree crowns. Few bounce or roll far on steep slopes covered by duff, leaves, and litter. Animals play a vital role in dissemination of acorns because they transport some of them away from the parent tree. The western gray squirrel and the scrub jay are the most important disseminators, for they bury the acorns, sometimes spreading the species to areas nearby. Black oak acorns are eaten by at least 14 species of song and game birds, many species and subspecies of small mammals (mostly rodents), and mule deer (20). Black bears in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California utilize the California black oak type in spring, summer, and fall (28). For many of these creatures, acorns are the primary foodstuff in the fall. Without acorns, populations are affected. Fawn survival rates, for example, increase and decrease with the size of the acorn crop. Cattle, and, to a lesser extent, sheep, also consume many black oak acorns each year. Seedling Development- California black oak reproduces from seed, but natural regeneration tends to be scanty, poorly distributed, and uncertain. The most likely place to find black oak seedlings is beneath large parent trees, where they number up to 45/m² (4/ft²). Before the seeds begin to germinate, a period of after-ripening to overcome dormancy is required. Overwintering beneath the litter on the forest floor normally breaks dormancy under natural conditions. For artificial regeneration, acorns can be stratified by cold storage in sealed polyethylene bags thick enough to inhibit moisture loss, but porous enough to freely emit respiration byproducts. Storage temperature should be just above freezing and moisture content of acorns maintained at a level where cotyledons are turgid or slightly flaccid, but not dried out. Natural seedbed requirements for germination are not exacting. Either undisturbed leaflitter or, to a lesser extent, moist, well-aerated mineral soil are good seedbeds. Establishment of black oak is almost nonexistent on heavy clay soils or soils compacted by logging machinery. These conditions reduce the ability of the radicle to penetrate the soil far enough and fast enough to avoid searing soil surface temperatures or the seasonal drying of upper soil layers. Acorns germinate in the spring when the weather warms. Germination is hypogeal and highly variable, both in magnitude and timing. The radicle is first to emerge and grows downward for some time, often 10 to 20 days, before the epicotyl appears above ground. This process benefits the seedling in getting to and staying in available soil moisture, and in minimizing transpirational losses. Sometimes a single acorn may put forth several epicotyls, particularly if upward progress is hampered by a stony or crusty soil. Under optimum conditions, 15 to 25 days elapse between sowing of stratified acorns and the beginning of germination. In nature, the germination period may be several weeks or even months. Germinative capacity varies considerably and changes with degree of insect infestation, amount of mold, and depth of acorn in soil, among other variables. Germination has been reported as high as 95 percent and also as scanty (21 percent). Germinative capacities in large-scale field tests in the northern Sierra Nevada were 31 and 38 percent (22). Black oak seedlings often reach heights of 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) and extend their taproots downward as deep as 76 cm (30 in) in the first growing season. Development of a deep-thrusting vertical root is necessary for seedlings to cope with the hot dry summers characteristic of California black oak's range. For the first few years, therefore, both lateral root development and shoot growth are slow. Shoot growth probably does not begin to accelerate until root capacity is extensive enough to obtain adequate moisture. This may take 6 or 7 years or longer. Shoot growth of some seedlings, particularly those stressed by competing vegetation, never accelerates and these seedlings eventually die. Studies evaluating artificially regenerated California black oak on the Plumas and Angeles National Forests in California indicate that artificial regeneration of black oak is possible, providing that competing vegetation and pocket gophers are controlled. Fall planting of 1-year-old seedlings, without artificial watering, resulted in good survival and growth on the San Bernardino National Forest, California (30). Fertilization appears to be one technique for enlarging root capacity and stimulating height development of seedlings. In a test in the northern Sierra Nevada, fertilized seedlings were more than three times taller than unfertilized seedlings (0.2 as against 0.8 m or 0.7 as against 2.5 ft) after five growing seasons. Fertilizer in the proportion of 1620-0 for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium was applied at about 0.1 kg (0.25 lb) per seedling early in the spring of each year (22). Young black oak seedlings are killed mostly by drought and pocket gophers. Grasshoppers and other insects damage young seedlings, and freezing by late spring frosts injures them. These injuries usually are mitigated by sprouting from the root crown. Vegetative Reproduction- California black oak sprouts profusely after trees are cut or burned. Most sprouts develop from latent buds, which lie under the bark at, or slightly above, the root collar. Other sprouts originate from the top of the stump or between the top and the ground. These are called stool sprouts and are undesirable for two reasons. They are weakly attached to the parent stump and frequently broken off by wind and snow, and are prone to heart rot at an early age. The size and vigor of the parent tree determine the number of sprouts and their height and crown spread. In general, stumps from larger trees produce a larger number of sprouts and more vigorous ones. Only old, moribund trees fail to produce sprouts after cutting. Low stumps of nearly all diameters produce many more sprouts than high stumps. High-stumping an older, larger tree yields undesirable stool sprouts, and often no sprouts from below ground. Root crown sprouts grow vigorously, especially in full sunlight. Forty-nine stumps were studied in stands on a good site in the northern Sierra Nevada. Sprout density, height, and crown width were evaluated in clearcuttings and in shelterwood stands where 50 percent of the basal area had been removed (22). Number of sprouts, crown width, and especially height growth were consistently greater in the clearcuttings (table 1). The environment typical of shelterwood cuttings apparently is more favorable to a cynipid gall wasp (Callirhytis perdens) than that in clearcuttings. Damage to terminal shoots by this pest is greater under shelterwood stands, accounting in part for the poorer height growth of sprouts. Thinning sprouts to three or four per stump at age 4 showed no gain in height but resulted in undesirable damage to the bole from sunscald and increased forking of stems (22). Young black oak sprouts grow faster in height than other vegetation, including coniferous associates. Consequently, they remain dominant for many years. Although black oak seedlings extend the species into new areas, sprouts keep the oak in the same area and are responsible for regenerating many more stands than seedlings. Only after the living crown has moved considerably up the bole does black oak begin its role as a nurse tree, aiding conifers to become established and grow to equal or dominant positions in the stand. Propagation by layering, rooting of cuttings, or grafting has not been reported. But the wartime shortage of cork in the 1940's stimulated grafting of cork oak (Quercus suber) to black oak stocks. In a greenhouse trial, 70 percent of the grafts were successful (27).",Reproduction and Early Growth,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Because fire incidence throughout its natural range is high, nearly all black oak trees originated from sprouts. Consequently most California black oak stands are even-aged. Number of sprouts per stump influences growth, form and, eventually, yield. The number per clump decreases rapidly with age. By the time the sprouts are pole-size, competition within individual clumps has reduced them to two or three, or occasionally, four stems. By age 100, only one or two stems remain. These data are based on 180 clumps at many California sites (21). The form of California black oak varies greatly. On the fringe of its range and on marginal sites, black oak trees assume a scrubby form. In closed stands on good sites, the oaks tend to be tall and straight with clear boles and thin crowns. When open-grown, black oaks generally fork repeatedly, becoming multistemmed and broad-crowned. The general age-height relationship of California black oak, based on 393 dominant trees in northern and central California, is curvilinear until age 140. Thereafter, tree height remains constant regardless of age. Selected age-heights are 20 years, 8 m (26 ft); 40 years, 13 m (43 ft); 60 years, 17 m (56 ft); 100 years, 22 m (72 ft); and 140 years, 25 m (82 ft) (21). Position on long continuous slopes also influences growth and form. Trees at the toe of slopes or on gently sloping benches, where deeper soils are likely, generally grow best and have good form. Those at midslope are shorter and more scrubby. On upper slopes, trees grow slowly and are even shorter. Aspect also influences growth. Of the 393 trees noted earlier, 100-year-old trees averaged about 26 m (85 ft) in height on east aspects; 22 m (72 ft) on north aspects; 21 m (68 ft) on west; and 17 m (56 ft) in height on south aspects. Average site index at base age 50 years is about 15 m (50 ft); better than average, about 18 m (60 ft); and poor, only 11 to 12 m (35 to 40 ft) (29). Diameter growth is often slow during the first 25 years of a black oak's life. Competition for position in the canopy tends to favor height growth over diameter growth. At 25 years, the average tree is nearly 11 m (35 ft) tall and about 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. and is one of three sprouts in the clump. Black oak grows fastest in diameter from age 25 to 65 (table 2). Its growth can reach one ring per centimeter or three rings per inch. At age 65 the tree is about 29 cm (11.5 in) in d.b.h. and has grown almost 0.5 cm/yr (0.2 in/yr). Black oak in an understocked stand averages 33 to 35 cm (13 to 14 in) in d.b.h. at 65 years; in an overstocked stand, it averages between 18 and 23 cm (7 to 9 in). After age 65, diameter growth slowly declines. By age 90 most trees are mature. Diameter growth of California black oak can be increased greatly by thinning. On a good site in the northern Sierra Nevada, diameter growth rates of trees thinned when 60 years old were twice that of unthinned trees of similar age 8 years after thinning (23). Black oak may live to be almost 500 years old, but age-diameter relationships beyond 120 years are uncertain. Trees 51 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. can range between 70 and 175 years. Trees 41 to 63 cm (16 to 25 in) in d.b.h. were 175 to 275 years old, and those more than 102 cm (40 in) were 175 to 325 years old. Black oak seldom exceeds 1.5 m (5 ft) in d.b.h. or 40 m (130 ft) in height. The largest living black oak known measures 274 cm (108 in) in d.b.h. and 37.8 m (124 ft) in height. This tree grows in the Siskiyou National Forest, OR (1). Yield data are difficult to find. The ""average"" stand contains 1,086 trees per hectare (440/acre), 8.9 cm (3.5 in) and larger in d.b.h., and would yield slightly more than 409 m³/ha (5,845 ft³ or 65 cords/acre). In 60-year-old mixed-hardwood stands on good sites in the northern Sierra Nevada, black oak produces 76 m³/ha (1,085 ft³ or 12.1 cords/acre). Rooting Habit- Various investigators have described the rooting system of black oak as having no taproot but large spreading roots (18); as deep and long lived; with a strong taproot; and possessing strong laterals, more or less deep, depending on depth to ground water (3). Observations at road cuts indicate the general rooting pattern of this oak. Usually, from one to several vertical roots extend through the soil and penetrate to rock. Then they become lateral and spread out directly above the rock. At fissures, ""sinker"" roots penetrate the rock itself. A number of roots are found near the surface, probably to exploit the nutrients there. Reaction to Competition- The tolerance of black oak to shade varies with age. It most accurately can be classed as intolerant because this condition exists throughout most of its life (9). The oak is moderately tolerant in early life, growing well in full sunlight but persisting in dense shade (31). As a sapling and small pole, black oak is less tolerant and often grows tall and thin until it reaches a position in the canopy where it can receive light. The need for top light increases as the tree ages. In dense stands, black oak often fills a ""hole"" in the canopy, sometimes leaning 15 to 20 degrees to do so. If overtopped, the oak either dies outright or dies back successively each year. Short epicormic branches keep the tree alive for a time, but with continued overtopping, death is inevitable. Damaging Agents- Fire is black oak's worst enemy. Crown fires kill trees of all ages and ground fires are often fatal. Only a little radiative heat kills the cambium and only a small amount of flame along the trunk leaves long vertical wounds. Bark thickness on mature trees varies from 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in), but even the thickest bark provides little insulation to fire. Scars from burning can become a point of entry for fungi. On larger trees, repeated fires often enlarge old scars, sometimes toppling the tree. Fluctuations in weather also cause injury. Heavy, wet snow breaks branches and stems, particularly at forks, and sudden high temperatures following cool wet weather severely injure leaves (25). California black oak is especially susceptible to fungi. Heart rot of the bole and large limbs of living trees, caused mainly by two pathogens, Inonotus dryophilus and Laetiporus sulphureus, is the principal damage (24). These rots enter the tree through broken branches or open wounds resulting from fire or logging. Both fungi often reduce the bole and large limbs of older, decadent trees to mere shells. The hedgehog fungus (Hydnum erinaceus) also is found in the heartwood of living trees and Polyporus adustus in the sapwood, though neither is prevalent. By the time a natural black oak stand is 85 years old, the proportion of infected trees begins to increase rapidly. Almost 40 percent of trees 110 to 120 years old show incipient heart rot (21). Rotation age of stands grown for wood products could be influenced by this incidence-age relationship. Another serious pathogen, Armillaria mellea, causes decay of the roots and butt of older decadent black oak. Sometimes it weakens the root system so much that the tree topples over on a perfectly calm, still day (36). This pathogen is indigenous in black oak, but younger vigorous trees do not seem to be affected by it. A comparatively recent damaging agent to black oak in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California is air pollution. Although the oak appears less susceptible to air pollution damage than associated conifers, radial growth has decreased in some trees (12). Where high ambient oxidant air pollution levels are chronic, damage to California black oak is expected to be significant (26). One virulent pathogen that black oak escapes, and indeed is resistant to, is Heterobasidion annosum (14). For this reason, California black oak is being planted in numerous infection centers in southern California forests where conifers are dead or dying. California black oak is prone to several leaf diseases including the oak leaf fungus (Septoria quercicola), oak anthracnose (Gnomonia veneta), powdery mildews (Microsphaera and Sphaerotheca spp.), a leaf blister fungus (Taphrina caerulescens), a leaf rust (Cronartium spp.), and true mistletoe (Phoradendron villosum subsp. villosum). Damage from each of these pests has not been determined but loss of growth increment probably is minor. Animal damage to black oak is mostly from browsing. Foliage is eaten during all seasons, but especially in spring when new growth is tender and in winter when twigs are eaten. Deer eat acorns, seedlings, sprouts, and foliage. Even in midsummer, newly germinated seedlings with acorns attached often are consumed (8). Occasionally, browsing is fatal. In Mendocino County, CA, for example, a deer population of 1/2.4 ha (1/6 acres) almost eliminated oak over large areas of the Coast Range. Cattle also browse black oak, but in national forests, at least, their numbers are declining. Many insects derive sustenance from black oak. The damage is usually secondary, reducing growth but seldom killing trees. Among sucking insects, the pit scales (Asterolecanium minus and A. quercicola) have the greatest potential for damage (4). The most destructive insect, however, is probably the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), whose larvae mine the wood of trunk and limbs and cause injuries that appear later as defects in lumber (16). Other insects are capable of heavy damage, especially when infestations become epidemic. The Pacific oak twig girdler (Agrilus angelicus) is the most damaging insect to oak in southern California during drought years (4). In northern California, the California oakworm (Phryganidia californica) is noted for defoliating trees. So is the fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospila) which, in 1968, caused heavy damage throughout a wide area in the Sacramento River drainage.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,14,0
"Probably the most important single soil variable that limits the presence of California black oak is internal drainage. Black oak is not found growing ""with its feet wet."" The species is adapted to soils derived from diverse parent materials-andesite, basalt, granite, pumice, quartz diorite, sandstone, schist, shale, and volcanic tuffs and breccias. California black oak only rarely is found on soils originating from serpentine. Occasionally it grows on soils derived from ultrabasic parent material, but mostly where above-average amounts of calcium seem to offset the deleterious effects of magnesium. Soil textures favoring this oak range from medium-textured loams and clay-loams to the more coarse-textured gravelly-clay-loams and sandy-loams. Increasing clay content in the surface soil usually means a decreasing incidence of black oak. In fact, this species rarely is found on soils with clay topsoils, particularly if the clay is heavy and sticky. Black oak usually grows on thin soils and rocky slopes, but always at the cost of abundance or form, or both. In general, black oak grows best on medium- to coarse-textured, deep, and well-drained soils. About 75 soil series in California have been identified by the California Cooperative Soil-Vegetation Survey and the National Cooperative Soil Survey as supporting California black oak. Important soil series in the California Coast Range include Boomer, Cohasset, Josephine, Sites, and Sheridan. In the Sierra Nevada, Aiken, Chawanakee, Holland, Stump Springs, Corbett, and Tish Tang support abundant black oak. Soils in the southern Cascade and Klamath Mountains that often are clothed with black oak include Aiken, Cohasset, McCarthy, Sites, Tournquist, Behemotosh, Horseshoe, and Neuns. Fourteen soil series have been identified in Oregon, mostly on series similar to those in California. Most of the soils in both States are found at higher elevations and support forest vegetation rather than oak woodland or chaparral. Soil orders are mostly Alfisols and Inceptisols, occasionally Mollisols. The best black oak stands in the Coast Range and Klamath Mountains are found on deep, slightly acid loams and gravelly-clay-loams derived from sandstone and shale. In the southern Cascade Range and northern Sierra Nevada, black oak grows best on deep loams and clay-loams originating from metavolcanic rocks. In the central and southern Sierra Nevada and in the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, this oak grows well on deep, acid to moderately acid sandy-loam soils derived from granitic rock. California black oak grows within a wide elevational range-from the level gravelly floors of low valleys to alluvial slopes, rocky ridges, and high plateaus. Most of the terrain is rugged, steep, and dissected by major streams and ephemeral drainages. In Oregon, the elevational range of black oak varies from 137 in (450 ft) near Eugene, to more than 305 m (1,000 ft) on the low rounded hills in the Umpqua River drainage (13). The oak also is found within this elevational range on the eastern slopes of the Coast Range and the western slopes of the Cascades. In south central Oregon and the Klamath Mountains, black oak grows at higher elevations of 610 to 915 m (2,000 to 3,000 ft). In California's Coast Range, black oak is found from about 152 in (500 ft) along the Mattole River in Humboldt County to 1830 in (6,000 ft) in the Yolla Bolly Mountains. Black oak reaches its lowest elevation (60 m or 200 ft) in the Napa and Santa Rosa Valleys. Most black oak in the central portion of the Coast Range grows between 305 to 1525 m (1,000 to 5,000 ft), gradually increasing in elevation but narrowing in range to 1220 to 1982 m (4,000 to 6,500 ft) in Santa Barbara and eastern Ventura Counties. Farther south in the Transverse Range the species is found at elevations of 1403 to 2135 m (4,600 to 7,000 ft) (39). In the San Jacinto Mountains, black oak reaches 2440 in (8,000 ft) and, at its southernmost extension in the Peninsular Range of San Diego County, it grows within the 1525- to 1830-m (5,000 to 6,000-ft) elevation. The elevational range of black oak in California's Cascade Range is from about 183 m (600 ft) in western Shasta County to 1906 in (6,250 ft) in southcentral Shasta County. In the Sierra Nevada, lower elevational limits for black oak range from 458 in (1,500 ft) in the north to 1220 in (4,000 ft) in the south. Upper limits increase north to south from about 1982 to 2380 m (6,500 to 7,800 ft). California black oak is most abundant and attains its largest size in the Sierra Nevada. Extensive stands of excellent development also are found in eastern Mendocino and Humboldt Counties of the north Coast Range. Elevation and aspect often interact to govern abundance and development. At elevations below 305 in (1,000 ft) in north-central California, black oak is found primarily in sheltered draws or on north slopes. With increasing elevation, favorable aspects increase until at 762 to 915 m (2,500 to 3,000 ft) all aspects support California black oak, providing soil is deep enough. Above 1067 in (3,500 ft), north- and east-facing slopes often are devoid of black oak, although other vegetation grows well. In the southernmost mountains, black oak is found on west-facing slopes, but only where soils are deep, temperatures are cool, and soil moisture is adequate.",Soils and Topography,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,15,0
"Several attributes qualify the wood of California black oak for commercial use: attractive grain and figure for paneling and furniture, hardness and finishing qualities for flooring, and strength properties for pallets, industrial flooring, and other uses (19). The forks of open-grown black oaks were put to good use in the 1870-80's in Mendocino County. Those of specific dimensions were used as ""naturally assembled"" ship keels and ribs. Wood products currently produced are high grade lumber and pallets, industrial timbers, sawdust for mulching, and bulk and prepackaged firewood. The wood is prized for fuelwood and in some areas unrestricted cutting is eliminating oak stands. Although not presently utilized, black oak acorns, high in edible oils, are a potential source for thousands of tons of human food (38).",Special Uses,California Black Oak,quercus,kelloggii,hardwood,16,0
"California red fir is a climax species nearly everywhere it is found. It shares climax status with white fir at the upper limit of the white fir zone, although at any given place California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana) or red fir regeneration may predominate (9,33). Throughout the Sierra Nevada, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) occupies wet sites within red fir forests. In the south, dry sites are shared with sugar pine (P. lambertiana), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), or incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens). Scattered individuals of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), sugar pine, and western white pine (P. monticola) are found in northern Sierra Nevada forests and as far south as Yosemite in the southern Sierra Nevada (32,33). In the Coast Ranges of California, Shasta red fir frequently shares dominance with noble fir (Abies procera) and is mixed with mountain hemlock and Brewer spruce (Picea breweriana) at elevations generally above 1850 m (6,100 ft). On high elevation serpentine soils, Shasta red fir is occasionally found with the more common foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana), western white pine, and Jeffrey pine (33). From the southern Cascades north into Oregon and west into the California Coast Ranges, Shasta red fir begins to lose its clear climax status, perhaps as a result of taking on characteristics of noble fir, which is never a climax species in the northern Cascades (9). Shasta red fir is replaced successionally by white fir at the lower elevations and by mountain hemlock at the upper. Major associated species include Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), white fir, western white pine, lodgepole pine, and mountain hemlock (9,33). Red fir is found in seven forest cover types of western North America. It is in pure stands or as a major component in Red Fir (Society of American Foresters Type 207) (7), and also in the following types: Mountain Hemlock (Type 205), White Fir (Type 211), Lodgepole Pine (Type 218), Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243), and California Mixed Subalpine (Type 256). Brush and lesser vegetation are varied. Dense red fir stands on good quality sites usually have no understory vegetation. In openings resulting from tree mortality or logging, and under open stands on poor sites, many species are possible depending on location (9,20,42). Currant or gooseberry (Ribes spp.), pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis), and mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus) are the most commonly found brush species (9,20,21). Large brush fields can dominate areas after severe fire. Fir eventually will reclaim these sites as the climax species. With some combinations of low site quality, brush species, and resident rodent population, however, reforestation can be effectively delayed for decades. Small upland meadows are common in red fir forests and provide habitats for a wide variety of sedges, grasses, and forbs.",Associated Forest Cover,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,1,1
"Climate for the red fir zone can be classified in general as cool and moist to cold and moist. It is relatively mild for high-elevation forests, with summer temperatures only occasionally exceeding 29° C (85° F) and winter temperatures rarely below -29° C (-20° F). One notable climatic feature is a 4- to 5-month summer dry spell. Between April (or May) and October, precipitation from scattered thunder-showers is negligible. Almost all precipitation occurs between October and March, with 80 percent or more as snow. Snowpack can exceed 4 m (13 ft) in the Sierra Nevada, and snow can accumulate to more than 2 m (7 ft) in Oregon and northwestern California (9,39). Total precipitation ranges from 750 to 1500 mm (30 to 60 in). Best growth appears to be in areas that receive between 750 and 1250 mm (30 and 49 in) of precipitation. Growth studies on Swain Mountain Experimental Forest, in the southern Cascades of California, indicate that California red fir grew best in years with unusually low precipitation (as low as 38 percent of normal) (29). Low precipitation there usually means early snowmelt and a longer growing season.",Climate,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,2,1
"In the northern part of its range, California red fir appears to merge and hybridize with noble fir, a northern species with morphological and ecological similarities. Bracts that extend beyond the scales on mature cones are characteristic of noble fir. North of Mount Lassen, red fir has similar exserted bracts. South of Mount Lassen, bracts on red fir are shorter than the scales and are not visible on intact mature cones. Changes in seed weight, cotyledon number, and cortical monoterpenes in both species indicate a broad transition zone between latitudes 40° and 44° N. Similarity with noble fir increases to the north and west (41). The two species can be artificially cross-pollinated with no apparent difficulty as long as red fir is the female parent. Success is reduced by more than 70 percent when red fir is the male parent (5,36). Discussion continues about the relationship of California red fir, Shasta red fir, and noble fir; however, the fact that exserted bracts also appear on a large southern Sierra Nevada population of red fir that has characteristics in common with both California red fir and Shasta red fir only adds to the controversy (41).",Genetics,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,7,1
"In California and southern Oregon, red fir is limited to high elevations. Its range extends from the central and southern Cascade Mountains of Oregon southward to Lake County in the Coast Ranges of northwest California and Kern County in the southern Sierra Nevada, from about latitude 43° 35' to 36° 50' N. Red fir is found outside these states only along the western border of Nevada, a few kilometers east of Mount Rose in Washoe County (8,9,22). Lower elevational limits begin at 1620 to 1800 m (5,300 to 5,900 ft) in the Cascade and Siskiyou Mountains and increase toward the south, reaching to 2130 m (7,000 ft) in the southern Sierra Nevada. Upper elevation limits also increase to the south, beginning at 2010 to 2190 m (6,600 to 7,200 ft) in the Cascade and Siskiyou Mountains, and reaching 2740 m (9,000 ft) in the southern Sierra Nevada. Red fir can be found growing at lower elevations in canyons and other protected places where significant cold air drainage keeps soil and air temperatures low (31). In the California Coast Ranges, Shasta red fir is found generally between 1400 and 1830 m (4,600 to 6,000 ft) (8,9,33). - The native range of California red fir.",Native Range,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Red fir is monoecious. Male strobili (cones) are small-generally less than 1.6 cm (0.6 in) long-deep purple-red, and densely clustered on the underside of 1-year-old twigs about midcrown. Female cones are borne erect on 1-year-old branches in the uppermost crown, although both male and female cones are occasionally found on the same branch. California red fir flowers from May to June, with pollen shed and fertilization in late May through June. Shasta red fir flowers from middle to late June in southwestern Oregon. Populations in the Coast Ranges of northwestern California probably follow the same schedule. Seeds begin to reach maturity in mid-August and the ripening process continues up to time of seedfall. Cones are large, 15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 in) long, 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) in diameter, and oblong cylindric in shape. Shasta red fir bracts are longer than the cone scales and are easily visible on the surface of a mature cone. California red fir bracts are shorter than the cone scales and are not visible on an intact cone. Cones of both varieties are brown when mature and have specific gravities of about 0.75 (8,27,28,36). Seed Production and Dissemination- California red fir can begin producing seed when only 35 to 45 years old; Shasta red fir produces seed when about 5 years younger (36). Heavy seed crops-adequate for reliable regeneration-are produced every 1 to 4 years by California red fir (22) and about every third year by Shasta red fir (12). Seeds are wind-disseminated after cones disintegrate on the trees in late September to mid-October and are dispersed primarily by the prevailing southwesterly winds (14). In an exceptional year, seed production for both varieties can exceed 1.4 million per ha (570,000/acre) within a stand and along the edge of an opening (11, 14). The more frequent ""good to heavy"" crops may only reach 10 percent of that value. Seed production varies with tree age, size, and dominance. The best, most reliable producers are mature, healthy dominants. Immature fir can produce heavy seed crops, but production is more erratic than that of mature trees (18). California red fir seeds average 14,110/kg (6,400/lb). Shasta red fir seeds tend to be smaller and average 16,095/kg (7,300/lb) (36). Because cones are borne almost exclusively in the uppermost crown, any top damage caused by insects, diseases, or mechanical agents (for example, wind and snow) directly reduces cone production. Large old trees are prone to such damage. Trees which have lost their tops, however, can frequently develop new terminals and resume cone bearing. Studies in California indicate that mature dominants along the edge of a clearcutting produce up to twice as many cones as similar trees in closed stands (18). Regeneration data, also from California, indicate that mature trees left in seed tree or shelterwood cuts increase seed production (25). The number of Shasta fir seeds falling into a clearing decreases rapidly with distance from the stand edge. At a downwind distance equal to about 2 to 2.5 times tree height, seedfall is nearly 10 percent of the stand edge value (11). Dispersal of the heavier California red fir seeds is generally limited to 1.5 to 2 times tree height (13). Germination rates in standard tests are relatively low for both varieties, generally less than 40 percent (36). Even lower field germination rates (5 percent or less) can produce adequate regeneration. Seedling Development- Red fir seeds germinate in the spring immediately after snowmelt or in, on, and under the snow (10,14). Germination is epigeal. Seeds that germinate several centimeters above ground in the snowpack rarely survive. Seeds that fall before the first permanent snows of winter, therefore, are more effective in producing seedlings. Initial survival is best on mineral soil, perhaps, as in white fir, because presence of appropriate mycorrhizal-forming fungi is increased in the absence of organic layers (3). Openings created in mixed red and white fir stands in both northern and southern Sierra Nevada tend to regenerate more readily to red fir. Fifty to 80 percent of the regeneration will be red fir, even when the surrounding stand is dominated by white fir (25,32). Two long-standing assumptions-that red fir growth is extremely slow for the first 20 to 30 years and that snow damage limits height growth-do not appear valid. Recent evidence indicates that beyond the first 5 years, slow growth is not inherent (16,24) and snow damage is significant for relatively few seedlings (17). Extended periods of slow early growth appear to result from environmental conditions, such as prolonged shading and browse damage. Vegetative Reproduction- Under natural conditions red fir does not reproduce vegetatively either by sprouting or layering. Vegetative propagation from cuttings is possible but the techniques currently available are at an early stage of development.",Reproduction and Early Growth,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Red fir volume production is impressive. Normal yield tables for unmanaged stands indicate that a 160-year-old stand on a high site- 18 m (60 ft) at 50 years-can carry 2320 m³/ha (33,150 ft³/acre). Average sites- 12 m (40 ft) at 50 years-carry 1470 m³/ha (21,000 ft³/acre) at the same age. These volumes are possible, at least in part, because of the stand density that red fir can maintain. Basal areas on high sites can be well in excess of 126 m²/ha (550 ft²/acre) and on average sites in excess of 96 m²/ha (420 ft²/acre). In addition, the normal yield tables indicate that stand mean annual increment continues to increase until age 140 (37). Less ideal stands will support slightly less basal area, and mean annual increment may culminate sooner. The capacity of the species to respond to decreases in stand density is impressive, even at the advanced age of 100 years. In stands of white and red fir thinned to 50 percent of their basal area, the remaining trees increased growth sufficiently that overall stand growth was not significantly reduced (30). Rooting Habit- Root systems of mature forest trees, including red fir, have not been the subject of much research. What little is known has been gleaned from observations of windthrown trees. Mature red fir rooting habit appears to be fairly adaptable, deep and intensive where soil conditions pen-nit or shallow and widespread where rocks or seasonal water tables limit effective soil depth. There is no strong tendency to maintain a single, deep taproot, although rapid development of a strong taproot is critical for survival of new germinants in the dry summer climate. On at least some sites, however, saplings and poles have large-diameter, carrot-like taproots extending more than 1 m (3 ft) deep, with very poor lateral root development in the upper 30 cm (12 in). This condition has been found on young pumice soils overlying an old, buried profile. Periodic lack of fall snow cover exposes the soil to subzero temperatures and increased temperature fluctuations. Under these conditions pumice soils are subject to ice crystal formation and severe frost heaving. Fine lateral roots are probably killed by mechanical damage during ice formation and frost heaving or, perhaps, by low temperatures. Red fir is susceptible to windthrow after partial cutting, especially when marginal codominant and lower crown classes are left as the residual stand (15). Root diseases contribute significantly to lack of windfirmness. Root grafting between red fir trees is indicated by the occasional presence of living stumps (8). The effects of mycorrhizal associations are beginning to be explored. Early information indicates that these root-fungi relationships are significant in establishment and early growth, especially on poor sites (3). Reaction to Competition- Although red fir grows best in full sunlight, it can survive and grow for long periods in relatively dense shade. Red fir's tolerance of shade appears to be less than that of mountain hemlock, slightly less than that of white fir and Brewer spruce, but greater than that of all of its other associates. Red fir's capacity to maintain significantly more foliage under shade than white fir suggests that the tolerance difference between them is marginal (1). It is most accurately classed as tolerant of shade. Red fir seedlings are slightly more hardy in full sun than white fir seedlings but become established most easily in partial shade (14,26). Red fir can carry large basal areas per unit area and maintain high growth rates for an unusually long time, partly as a result of its shade tolerance. As an understory tree it can survive more than 40 years of suppression and, unless diseased, respond to release by increasing growth dramatically. Time until growth accelerates depends on crown condition. Even mature dominants can respond to large reductions in stand density. Seed production on mature dominants can increase after release (16,25,26,38). Natural regeneration of red fir can be achieved using shelterwood and seed tree cuttings. Clearcuts work as long as the size of the opening perpendicular to the wind does not exceed seed dispersal distances. Site preparation is important (19). Recent developments in nursery and handling technologies, including manipulation of root regeneration capacity and identification of necessary storage and transportation conditions, make artificial planting commercially practical. Access to planting sites is commonly difficult in the Sierra Nevada because of heavy snowpacks that last until June and later. It is theoretically possible to manage several age classes in a stand because of the species' shade tolerance. However, the ability of red fir to support high growth rates for extended periods in dense, even-aged stands makes even-aged management the likely choice on most sites. Patch cuttings of small areas- 0.2 to 2.2 ha (0.5 to 5.5 acres)- work well where larger regeneration cuts are undesirable for visual or environmental reasons. Damaging Agents- Red fir is subject to damage from abiotic agents, pathogens, insects, and animals. Little is known about the tolerance of red fir to most abiotic aspects of the environment. Initial survival of seedlings seems to be better under partial shade although growth is best in full sunlight. The early advantage of shade may be related to protection from temperatures in exposed duff and litter that can frequently exceed 70° C (160° F) early in the growing season (14). Red fir appears to be more sensitive to drought than white fir or the associated pines (26), even though over most of its range there may be no precipitation for as long as 5 months during the summer. A tendency of red fir to grow poorly where snowmelt water collects, as on mountain meadows, indicates a moderate sensitivity to high soil moisture content during the growing season (8). Frosts can occur any month of the year, but damage to red fir is minimal and significant only on Christmas trees. Red fir is more frost resistant than white fir and about equal to Jeffrey pine (19). The importance of mechanical injury increases as intensive management of dense young red fir stands increases. Studies in Oregon and California show that conventional logging techniques used for thinning or partial cutting damaged 22 to 50 percent of the residual stand. Seventy-five percent of these wounds were at ground level where infection by a decay-causing fungus is almost certain (2). Volume losses by final harvest can be considerable, although the amount varies greatly from place to place, perhaps due to type and frequency of wounds (2). Among pathogens, one parasitic plant causes major damage. Red fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium abietinum f. sp. magnificae) is common throughout the range of red fir and infests 40 percent of the stands in California (34). Heavily infected trees suffer significant growth losses and are subject to attack by Cytospora abietis, a fungus that kills branches infected by dwarf mistletoe and further reduces growth. Because of reduced vigor, infected trees are more susceptible to bark beetle attack and other diseases (34). Heart rots, entering through open mistletoe stem cankers, increase volume loss directly and mortality indirectly through stem breakage. Recent unpublished research suggests that losses from bole infection may be of minimal consequence in well-managed second-growth true fir stands (35). Changes in wood structure in large stem bulges resulting from dwarf mistletoe infections reduce strength of lumber produced. Current lumber grading practices, however, are not adequate to identify the affected wood (40). Dwarf mistletoe need not be a problem in young managed stands because four factors make damage subject to silvicultural control. Red fir can be infected only by red fir dwarf mistletoe which, in turn, can parasitize only one other fir, noble fir. Small trees (less than 1 m [3.3 ft] tall) are essentially free from infection even in infested stands. Infected young firs, free from new overstory infection, outgrow the spread of mistletoe if height growth is at least 0.3 m (1 ft) per year, and losses from bole infections are expected to be minimal in managed, young-growth stands (34,35). Silvicultural practices that can significantly reduce the impact of dwarf mistletoe include removal of an infected overstory before natural regeneration exceeds 1 m (3.3 ft) in height, and stocking control to promote rapid height growth. Different species can be favored in the overstory and understory of mixed stands during thinnings or partial cutting. Sanitation of stand edges adjacent to regeneration areas and planting a non-host species (such as white fir adjacent to a red fir stand) appropriate to the site can prevent infection from overstory trees. Fir broom rust (Melampsorella caryophyllacearum) is abundant in the central and southern Sierra Nevada. This disease primarily affects branches but can infect trunks. It can cause spike tops and loss of crown and provide an entry court for heart rots. Fir broom rust can occasionally kill trees, especially seedlings and saplings (4). Annosus root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) is present in all conifer stands and may become a major disease problem as red fir is increasingly and intensively managed. Infection is spread from tree to tree by root contact, forming disease pockets in the stand that slowly expand. Infection of freshly cut stumps or new wounds by aerially spread spores creates new infection centers that do not become evident until 10 to 20 years after infection. Annosus root rot does not usually kill red fir directly, but root damage results in considerable moisture stress and loss of vigor. The loss of vigor predisposes the tree to attack by bark beetles, notably Scolytus spp. Direct damage resulting from infection is restricted primarily to heart rot of butt and major roots, leading to windthrow and stem breakage (4). Some degree of control is available through use of borax to prevent infection by Heterobasidion annosum in freshly cut stumps. Other heart rots of major significance include the yellow cap fungus (Pholiota limonella) and Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorium). These fungi cause major losses in old-growth trees. Young trees are generally not affected because they have so little heartwood. Yellow cap fungus tends to be a more severe disease in California, and Indian paint fungus is more severe in Oregon. Yellow cap fungus generally enters through basal wounds. Rot can extend 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft) up the trunk. Indian paint fungus probably infects red fir in the same manner as it does western hemlock (2). The fungus enters through branchlets less than 2 mm (0.08 in) in diameter and can remain dormant for as long as 50 years before being activated by injury or stress (6). Dead or broken tops are other points of entry for Indian paint fungus. The resulting rot is located in the upper bole and may extend to the ground. Open dwarf mistletoe cankers serve as entry courts for several decay fungi. None of the heart rots kill directly but predispose the tree to stem breakage. No effective control is known for decay fungi, except possibly Heterobasidion annosum, other than avoiding as much root, stem, and top damage as possible during stand management (4). Insects from five genera attack red fir cones and seeds. Losses can be significant. Cone maggots (Earomyia spp.) cause the most damage. Several chalcids (Megastigmus spp.) and cone moths (Barbara spp. and Eucosma spp.) can occasionally cause heavy local damage to seed crops, especially in poor seed years (13). Cutworms (Noctuidae) can be a problem in nurseries and may be especially damaging in natural regeneration areas. Cutworms were responsible for more than 30 percent of the seedling mortality in a study on Swain Mountain Experimental Forest in California (14). The white fir needleminer (Epinotia meritana) is the only foliage feeder of consequence on established red fir. Even during outbreak phases the damage caused is apparently minor and temporary (13). The most severely damaging insect pest on red fir is the fir engraver (Scolytus ventralis). This bark beetle is found throughout the range of red fir and causes severe damage nearly everywhere. Losses under epidemic conditions can be dramatic. Anything that reduces tree vigor-Annosus root disease, dwarf mistletoe, Cytospora canker, overstocking, drought, or fire damage-increases susceptibility to fir engraver attack. Several other species of bark beetles (Scolytus spp., Pseudohylesinus spp.), the round-headed fir borer (Tetropium abietis), and the flat-headed fir borer (Melanophila drummondi) frequently join in attacking and killing individual trees. In epidemic conditions, however, mortality is caused primarily by the fir engraver. Maintenance of stand health and vigor is the only known control (13). Locally, small rodents can cause significant loss of seed and occasionally girdle seedlings. Squirrels cut and cache cones. Pocket gophers limit regeneration in many areas, particularly clearcuts, by feeding on fir seedlings during winter and spring. Pocket gophers in combination with meadow voles and heavy brush can prevent conifer establishment for decades. Where gopher populations are high, damage to root systems of mature trees can be extensive, although not often identified. In extreme conditions, winter and spring feeding at root crowns can kill trees up to at least 94 cm (37 in) in diameter at breast height (23). Direct control is difficult and expensive. Indirect control by habitat manipulation offers some possibilities. Spring browsing of succulent growth by deer can retard height growth for many years. Normally, trees are not killed and in most instances can grow rapidly once browsing pressure is removed. In managed stands, reduced height growth can result in significant production loss. Red fir may be damaged less by deer or rabbit feeding than white fir.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,14,1
"Red fir is found at high elevations on mountain ranges that continue in active formation. The soils on which it grows are therefore young and fall into four orders, Entisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Spodosols. They are classified as mesic to frigid or cryic, with mean annual soil temperatures (at 50 cm; 20 in) between 0° and 15° C (32° and 59° F). All soils but the Alfisols tend to be light colored, shallow, with minimal or no horizon development, and low in cation exchange capacity and base saturation. Most are classified in some degree as xeric because of the long summer dry period. Horizon development is relatively poor even in the mesic Alfisols. The Spodosols are developed poorly without a true leached A horizon because of inadequate warm season precipitation. In the Cascades, red fir is occasionally found on pumice deposits overlying old soils. Decomposition of needles and other litter tends to be slow in the wet winter, dry summer climate. Organic material collects on the surface where it forms dense black mats from 2 to 8 cm (0.75 to 3.0 in) or more thick (8). Tree growth and stand development are best on the deeper soils associated with glacial deposits or Pleistocene lake beds. On steep slopes where soils are shallowest, stands are open and tree growth poor. On moderate to gentle slopes and flat ground where water does not collect, stands are closed with no understory or herbaceous vegetation (8).",Soils and Topography,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,15,1
"Red fir is a general, all-purpose construction-grade wood used extensively as solid framing material and plywood. Good quality young red fir, known as ""silvertip fir"" from the waxy sheen on their dense, dark-green needles, bring top prices as Christmas trees. These trees are cultured in natural stands and plantations where early growth is slower than most species used as Christmas trees, and some individuals are cultured for as long as 11 years before harvest. Detailed and exact wildlife censuses for large areas do not exist and any listing of species numbers associated with a major forest type is an approximation. There are, however, about 111 species of birds found in the red fir type of California, 55 of which are associated primarily with mature forests. Perhaps because of the dense nature of most true fir forests, there are only about 52 species of mammals commonly present and only 6 of those are generally associated with mature forests. Few reptilian species are found at the high elevations and only four are generally present in the red fir type.",Special Uses,California Red Fir,abies,magnifica,conifer,16,1
"California-laurel is more commonly found in mixture with other species than in pure stands. Choice pure stands were eliminated when coastal and inland valleys were cleared for agriculture, and only scattered groves and tracts of large mature trees remain-many in parks or preserves (40). Pure stands of tall young growth are also limited, but pure stands of shorter trees, thickets, or prostrate mats are common on coastal bluffs, in canyons, and elsewhere in California (19,24,35,61). California-laurel is listed as an associated species in six forest cover types: Port Orford-Cedar (Society of American Foresters Type 231), Redwood (Type 232), Oregon White Oak (Type 233), Douglas-fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234), Canyon Live Oak (Type 249), and California Coast Live Oak (Type 255) (13). Its prominence in these types, as well as in several others for which it is not specifically listed, varies widely. Many trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants are associated with California-laurel in different parts of its extensive range (table 1). The listing in table 1 is not exhaustive; it indicates the variety of associated species. Usually, fewer species and fewer individuals per species are found under the California-laurel canopy than under the canopy of associated trees, and the area bare of all vegetation is greater. In the Coast Ranges south of San Francisco Bay, an average of 36 species per site, mostly perennials, was found under the California-laurel canopy, 55 species beneath the canopy of other trees (61). Distances bare of vegetation along transects ranged from 9 to 48 percent of the total under California-laurel, 0 to 10 percent under other trees. Where the laurel canopy is particularly dense and extensive, understory vegetation may almost be limited to mosses, ferns, and laurel seedlings (7,51).",Associated Forest Cover,California-Laurel,umbellularia,californica,hardwood,1,0
"California-laurel grows in diverse climates, ranging from the cool, humid conditions found in dense coastal forests to the hot, dry atmospheres found inland in open woodlands and chaparral. Records from 38 climatic observation stations within or bordering its range indicate that California-laurel has endured temperature extremes of -25° to 48° C (-13° to 118° F) (41,46,59). Average annual temperatures range from 8° to 18° C (46° to 64° F); average temperatures in January, from -1° to 10° C (31° to 50° F); and in July, from 13° to 29° C (56° to 84° F). Average annual precipitation ranges from 338 mm (13.3 in) at Lemon Cove in the southern Sierra Nevada to 2118 mm (83.4 in) at Gold Beach by the mouth of the Rogue River in Oregon. Average annual snowfall ranges from zero at some coastal locations to 742 em (292 in) at Blue Canyon in Placer County, CA. Average precipitation in the growing season (April through September) ranges from 18 to 432 mm (0.7 to 17.0 in). Length of average frost-free season (above 0° C or 32° F) ranges from 139 to 338 days.

"The range of California-laurel spans more than 11° of latitude, from below the 44th parallel in the Umpqua River Valley of Douglas County, OR, south beyond the 33d parallel in San Diego County, CA. In the Coast Ranges, the southern limit is on eastern slopes of the Laguna Mountains, a short distance from the Mexican border (19). In the Sierra Nevada, it extends as far south as the west slope of Breckenridge Mountain in Kern County (58). Eastward from the coast, California-laurel extends to the foothills of the Cascade Range in Oregon and California, into the western Sierra Nevada for its entire length, and to the inland side of the Coast Ranges south of San Luis Obispo, CA. Its farthest extent inland, about 257 km (160 mi), is in the southern Sierra Nevada.",Native Range,California-Laurel,umbellularia,californica,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- California-laurel flowers regularly and often profusely. The pale yellow, perfect flowers, 15 mm (0.6 in) in diameter, grow on short-stemmed umbels that originate from leaf axils or near the terminal bud. Flower buds develop early; those for the following year become prominent as current-year fruits are maturing. Flowering within the long north-south range of California-laurel has occurred in all months from November to May, beginning before new leaves appear (24,25,29,61). The flowering period may stretch into late spring and summer by the occasional appearance of flowers originating in axils of developing leaves (48). California-laurel flowers at an early age; flowers have been observed on short whiplike shrubs and on 1-year-old sucker growth that originated on a long broken stub (50). Small insects appear to be the chief pollinators (25). The fruits-acrid drupes each containing a single, thin-shelled, nutlike seed 15 min (0.6 in) in diameter-ripen in the first autumn after flowering (52). As drupes mature, their thin, fleshy hull changes from medium green to speckled yellow-green, pale yellow, or various other hues from yellow-green tinged with dull red or purple through purplish brown to purple. Ripe drupes may be yellow-green on one tree, dark purple on an adjacent tree (11). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed crops are abundant in most years. Although umbels bear four to nine flowers each, generally only one to three fruits set (24). The age when a tree first bears fruit, the age for maximum production, and the average quantity produced have not been determined. Seeds are produced in abundance after trees are 30 to 40 years old (20). Drupes fall stemless to the ground in late autumn or winter and are dispersed by gravity, wind, animals, and water (34). Fallen drupes are easily gathered by hand. The drupes are large and heavy; 454 g (1 lb) of drupes may yield about 300 cleaned seeds (39). Under favorable natural conditions, seeds on the ground retain viability over winter, but, under adverse conditions, viability may prove very transient. Viability has been maintained for 6 months when seeds were stored at 3° C (37° F) in wet, fungicide-treated vermiculite (34). Fresh, untreated seeds germinate indoors or outdoors in peat moss, sawdust, vermiculite, or light-textured soil but may require 3 months or longer (25,39,60). Germination can be speeded by scarifying, cracking, or removing the endocarp, or stratifying the seed, but up to 2 months may still be required (25,34,60). In comparison tests made in petri dishes, California-laurel germination was highest in 30 days under a temperature regime of 16° C (61° F) day, 7° C (45° F) night, and when evaporative stress was minimal (34). Germination did not appear to be affected by light level but was highest in soil with moisture tension at 4 to 10 atmospheres. Seedling Development- Germination occurs naturally in autumn soon after seedfall, or in late winter and spring (52). Covered seeds germinate best, but the large seeds are not buried readily without ground disturbance or silt deposition by high water. Seedling establishment is not common in the drier parts of California except in protected areas and where ground is disturbed (24). California-laurel seedlings invade grasslands and brushlands in the Berkeley Hills; similar capabilities were observed in the Santa Cruz Mountains (34,61). Germination is hypogeal, and the fleshy cotyledons remain within the endocarp and attached to the seedling until midsummer, when the plant may be 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) tall (25,48). Generally there are two large cotyledons, sometimes three, and no endosperm. Seedlings produce leaves of several transitional forms as they develop and do not branch until they are 2 or 3 years old unless induced to do so by removal of the terminal bud. They soon develop a moderately stout taproot and are difficult to transplant if more than 1 year old unless grown in containers. Recovery after transplanting is often slow, and height growth may be limited for several seasons. Young California-laurel seedlings appear flexible in their growth requirements. In the first 120 days, seedlings potted in vermiculite grew well at several levels of temperature, evaporative stress, soil moisture, and soil nutrients (34). Seedlings grown at 18 percent or more of full sunlight produced the most dry weight. Vegetative Reproduction- California-laurel can be reproduced by cuttings (60), but techniques need further development. Under natural conditions, it may sprout prolifically from the root collar, stump, and trunk. Sprouts and suckers develop wherever a canopy opening admits strong light from the side or overhead. Stumps ringed with root-collar sprouts and both fallen and standing live trunks entirely enveloped in new green sucker growth are common (24). Crowns formed by clumps of sprouts growing in the open typically assume a distinctive, very dense, and symmetrically rounded shape (12,50).",Reproduction and Early Growth,California-Laurel,umbellularia,californica,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Over much of its range, California-laurel attains heights of 12 to 24 m (40 to 80 ft) and diameters of 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in). On protected bottom lands of southwestern Oregon and northern California, mature trees are 91 to 183 cm (36 to 72 in) in d.b.h. and 30 in (100 ft) or more in height (20,24). A maximum d.b.h. of 404 cm (159 in) (1) and a maximum height of 53.3 m (175 ft) have been reported (49). California-laurel occurs as a noncontiguous forest type on about 76 080 ha (188,000 acres), 9 712 ha (24,000 acres) in Oregon and 66 368 ha (164,000 acres) in California (4,17). As a component of conifer or other hardwood types, it occurs on an additional 437 060 ha (1,080,000 acres) in California and an undetermined additional acreage in Oregon. Total growing stock volume is approximately 14.7 million m³ (520 million ft³). In California, the mean stand growing-stock volume in the type is 117 m³ per ha (1,677 W/acre), with a maximum of about 218 m³ per ha (3,125 W/acre). The growth rate of California-laurel varies greatly because of the many climatic, soil, and competitive conditions in which it occurs. Several observers report its height growth is slow, about 0.3 in (1 ft) per year, but on good sites in southern Oregon, height growth averages between 0.3 and 0.6 in (1 to 2 ft) per year (3,12,51). Growth of trees from seed to 38 or 41 cm (15 or 16 in) diameter in 50 years has been reported (57). Total number of stems 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. or larger in California and Oregon stands with a large component of California-laurel ranged from 245 to 2,402/ha (99 to 972/acre); reported basal areas ranged from 34.0 to 167.4 m²/ha (148 to 729 ft²/acre) (51,61,62). Multiple trunks frequently develop in both opengrown and closed stands of California-laurel. Trees in the open often attain a crown spread greater than their height and may not develop a well-defined upper trunk. Many forest-grown trees also fork repeatedly; forking within 3 in (10 ft) of the ground is common. Generally each fork grows vertically and side branches die. Adjacent forked and unforked trees make similar height growth. Rooting Habit- The root system of California-laurel has been described as fleshy, deep, and widespreading (49). Several exceptions have been noted, however. Root wads of windthrown trees from alluvial soil in southern Oregon were limited in extent and without a prominent taproot (50). Root systems of seedlings and young trees dug near Berkeley, CA, had relatively shallow root systems, as did some fallen older trees (28). Over half the roots in representative California-laurel stands in the Berkeley Hills were distributed in the top 30 cm. (12 in) of Los Osos adobe clay and all were in the top 90 cm. (36 in) (34). In contrast to the paucity of information on the shape and extent of the root system of California-laurel, its root structure has been thoroughly investigated (26,27). Reaction to Competition- California-laurel is generally classed as shade tolerant, but the tolerance level is not well defined. A very dense canopy is formed by its thick evergreen leaves, which persist 2 to 6 years. The presence of many small seedlings but no saplings under some closed canopies and the development of long boles clear of live limbs indicate that laurel is not always tolerant of its own shade. These indicators are no criteria of tolerance relative to other species, however, and laurel trees are common among moderately dense conifers. In some localities, California-laurel appears to be the climax vegetation (7,24,34,61). It is relatively long lived, reproduces from both seeds and sprouts, forms dense pure canopies, and appears to have few serious natural enemies. California-laurel reproduces itself at natural light intensities of 1 to 5 percent of full sunlight; the most dry weight in one experiment was produced at 18 percent of full sunlight, but growth was also reasonable at 8 percent (34,61). Allelopathic influences have been suspected as the cause of more bare ground under canopy of California-laurel than under canopy of associated trees. Bioassay experiments showed that the leaf and litter volatiles, leachates, and extracts of laurel are capable of inhibiting germination and growth of several test species (56,61). The distribution of California-laurel in the Coast Ranges south of San Francisco appears to represent a vegetational continuum (61). About the same mixture of understory plants was found under California-laurel canopies as under associated trees, but California-laurel and some of its associates seemed to have a greater tendency to spread to other communities than species from those communities to invade California-laurel woodland. Damaging Agents- Wind and snow cause appreciable destruction and deformation in California-laurel stands. Blowdown is common during severe wind and rain storms in California and Oregon (24,51). Wet clinging snow abets windthrow, breaks tops, and splits forks. Striking examples of crown deformation and molding by strong winds are numerous near the coast. Because of its thin bark, the tree is easily top-killed by fire, but it sprouts rapidly. Dense clumps are often formed on cutover land, which may prevent the establishment of desired conifers. Very young California-laurel seedlings have less capacity than dwarf chaparral broom (Baccharis pilularis) or coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) to resprout after complete destruction by heat at ground level (34). California-laurel is relatively tolerant to boron. In comparison tests, it was less tolerant to boron than Digger pine (Pinus sabiniana) but more tolerant than Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii) or bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) (18). More than 40 species of fungi have been observed on California-laurel, and perhaps three (Anthostoma oreodaphnes, Nectria umbellulariae, and Sphaerella umbellulariae) are restricted to this species (48). Few fungi cause serious damage to the living tree. In central coastal California, a severe outbreak of laurel leaf blight followed abnormally heavy precipitation in two of three winters. A bacterium, Pseudomonas lauracearum, and two fungi, Kabatiella phoradendri f. sp. umbellulariae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, were isolated from affected leaves (42). No trees were killed and crowns leafed out anew the following year. Dieback of twigs and new shoots was substantial, however, and was followed by scattered dieback of branches up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter associated with a Botryosphaeria sp., a fungus that has been blamed for much damage to this species (23). Incidence of infection by endophytic fungi, primarily Septogloeum sp., averaged 25 percent for leaf samples of California-laurel collected from four sites representing an environmental gradient in southwestern Oregon (44). Several sooty molds and other diseases are found on laurel leaves; the stem canker, Nectria galligena, occurs primarily where snow, ice, or wind cause severe bending and cracks in the bark of stems and branches; and Ganoderma applanatum fruits readily on scarred trees. Wood rot is common in California-laurel. Various fungi cause decay associated with wounds, and G. applanatum may function as a heart rot in live wood (23). Even in young stands, dead knots, stem malformations, and root collars are often decayed. Cull in one northern California study averaged 7 and 10 percent of the gross cubic volume in trees of saw log or cordwood size and quality, respectively (31). California-laurel has no serious insect enemies. A leafblotch miner (Lithocolletis umbellulariae), a stag beetle (Dichelonyx valida), and a thrips (Thrips madronii) cause some damage to leaves. The cottonycushion scale (Icerya purchasi) used to be very damaging but is now under control (48). Several wood borers and beetles attack dead parts of the tree; but only the powderpost beetle (Ptilinus basalis) that attacks dead and stored wood and oak bark beetles (Pseudopityophthorus spp.) that infest injured, felled, and recently dead trees cause damage of economic consequence (16). Except for seed consumption, animal damage to California-laurel appears minor. In some localities and situations, browsing damage to seedlings and new sprout growth may be of consequence. Young laurel seedlings are browsed less than some associated species (34).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,California-Laurel,umbellularia,californica,hardwood,14,0
"California-laurel grows to tree size in a wide variety of topographic locations and kinds of soil if moisture conditions are favorable. It grows on steep mountain slopes, exposed ridges, coastal bluffs, and rocky outcrops, as well as in protected valleys, alluvial flats, deep canyons and ravines, and low hills. In Oregon and most of California, it grows from sea level to 1220 in (4,000 ft). Near the southern end of the species' range, the lower altitudinal limit rises to 610 in (2,000 ft) on south slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains, and the upper limit approaches 1520 in (5,000 ft) on the west slopes of the San Jacinto Mountains. In the Sierra Nevada, the upper limit reaches 1520 in (5,000 ft) in Kaweah Basin west of Sequoia National Park (24). Even in dry, hot climates it can become a large tree on moist sites; specimens of unusual height, diameter, crown spread, and age can be found in many California counties (43). Distribution is more restricted in such climates, however, and the species is most common on alluvial deposits or gravelly outwashes at the mouths of canyons, on protected slopes, along and near watercourses, near springs and seeps, and in spring-watered gulches. Under very adverse conditions, California-laurel grows as an understory shrub, as a common component of chaparral, or even as a prostrate mat near the ocean (24,47). In tree or shrub form, California-laurel grows in soils derived from alluvial deposits, from sedimentary rocks, from volcanic flows of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, and from old formations in the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains. It grows on soils of three or more orders; principal among these are Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Ultisols. Specific soils supporting growth of California-laurel include the Ben Lomond, Felton, Gazos-Sweeney, Gazos-Calera, Hugo, Hugo-Josephine, Los Gatos, Los Gatos-Maymen, Maymen, Montara, and Soquel series in the Santa Cruz Mountains (61); the Los Osos adobe clay in the Berkeley Hills (35); alluvium and the Galice, Umpqua, and Tyee sedimentary formations in coastal California and Oregon (22,62); and gabbro, peridotite, and serpentine in the Siskiyou Mountains (22,63). Best development and most rapid growth occur on deep, well-drained alluvial benches and valley bottoms subject to occasional inundation. Growth is also good on well-watered soils of coastal slopes and along higher foothill streams. The pH of several surface soils supporting pure or mixed stands of California-laurel was found to range from 5.7 to 7.4 (34,61,62,63). Soil properties under California-laurel crowns in central California generally did not differ significantly from those under crowns of the nearest associate species (61).",Soils and Topography,California-Laurel,umbellularia,californica,hardwood,15,0
"Wood of California-laurel compares favorably in machining quality with the best eastern hardwoods (8) and is used for fancy turned woodenware, interior trim, cabinets, furniture, paneling, veneer, and gunstocks. Burls and other growths with unusual grain are especially prized for making gifts, novelties, and wood carvings, all marketed as myrtlewood. The wood of mature trees is moderately heavy, hard, fine grained, rich yellowish brown to light gray, and often beautifully mottled. The wood of younger trees generally has less distinctive grain and markings. By rough estimate, 19 950 to 22 800 m³ (3.5 to 4 million fbm) are used annually in the myrtlewood industry. Indians and early settlers used all parts of the tree for food and medicinal purposes (6,21). Leaves are still collected and dried for home use and commercial sale as a food seasoning (5,37,61). The leaves, seeds, and wood have strong chemical properties and should be used for food, seasoning, or medicinal purposes with caution (5,9,36,48,61). California-laurel is used for hedges, windbreaks, and indoor and outdoor ornamental evergreens (3,29,41,43). It also provides food and cover for wildlife (53). Silver gray squirrels, dusky-footed woodrats, California mice, and Steller's jays feed extensively on the seeds (54,55). Hogs eat both seeds and roots. Young sprouts are choice browse for deer and goats in spring and summer (33,47) when volatile components of leaves are at lowest concentrations (30).",Special Uses,California-Laurel,umbellularia,californica,hardwood,16,0
"In southwestern Oregon, canyon live oak is primarily associated with Douglas-fir, tanoak, giant chinkapin (Castanopsis chrysophylla), and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii) in the mixed evergreen forests. In these forests it is a codominant tree and a shrub in the Pseudotsuga menziesii-Quercus chrysolepis-Lithocarpus densiflorus/Quercus chrysolepis-Lithocarpus densiflorus climax community type. On steep canyon slopes, it is dominant in the Quercus chrysolepis-Lithocarpus densiflorus-Pseudotsuga menziesii/Rhus diversiloba/ moss community. On benches and ridgetops, canyon live oak along with tanoak occupies the lower tree canopy of the Pseudotsuga, -menziesii-Pinus spp./Lithocarpus densiflorus-Quercus chrysolepis-Castanopsis chrysophylla /Pteridium aquilinum community. Canyon live oak also is a major codominant in the successional evergreen chaparral, along with hoary manzanita (Arctostaphylos canescens) and greenleaf manzanita (A. patula). In the mixed conifer zone of the western slope of the Cascade Range, canyon live oak primarily grows in semipermanent fire chaparral associated with snowbrush ceanothus (Ceanothus velutinus) (6). In the Klamath region of northern California, canyon live oak is an occasional small tree or shrub throughout the Abies concolor zone of the montane or mixed conifer forest of the interior side of the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains. In the Abies concolor /Arbutus menziesii/Corylus cornuta type, canyon live oak is a codominant lower canopy tree under ponderosa pine, sugar pine, and white fir (Abies concolor). The associated codominant lower canopy trees are giant chinkapin, bigleaf maple, and Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii) (10). It is also an understory tree in the Abies concolor/Vicia americana, Abies concolor/Chimaphila umbellata, Abies concolorlBerberis nervosa, and Abies concolor/Ceanothus prostratus types (1) and, at lower elevations, in the forest cover types Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Society of American Foresters Type 244) and Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245) (5). In the Coast Ranges of northern California, canyon live oak is a major component of the mixed evergreen forest or Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234). In these forests, it is associated with bigleaf maple, California-laurel, coast live oak Quercus agrifolia), Douglas-fir, madrone, and tanoak. Canyon live oak is not usually found in the modal mixed evergreen community dominated by Douglas-fir and tanoak; however, it is dominant on steep, southwestern slopes associated with Douglas-fir and madrone in a Quercus chrysolepis/Pseudotsuga menziesii type. In the southern portion of the mixed evergreen forests, canyon live oak assumes more importance along with ponderosa pine. On serpentine soils, canyon live oak is a minor climax associate in the Pinus ponderosa/Ceanothus cuneatus, Pseudotsuga menziesii/Corylus cornuta, and Lithocarpus densiflorus/Gaultheria shallon types (20). In the central Coast Ranges of California, canyon live oak is a codominant in the mixed hardwood forests (Blue Oak-Digger Pine, Type 250), associated with coast live oak, blue oak (Quercus douglasii), interior live oak (Q. wislizeni), California black oak (Q. kelloggii), madrone, tanoak, California laurel, and Digger pine (Pinus sabiniana). In this area, it also occurs in successional chaparral associated with Eastwood manzanita (Arctostaphylos glandulosa). At higher elevations, canyon live oak is dominant in the canyon live oak-Coulter pine forest (Canyon Live Oak, Type 249). In the Sierra Nevada of California, canyon live oak is found in several forest types. In the low-elevation foothill woodland forest, it is occasionally found on steep, north-facing slopes associated with interior live oak, blue oak, and Digger pine. In the mixed oak woodland, canyon live oak is a codominant with interior live oak, along with a prominent understory of manzanita, toyon, and western poison-oak (Rhus diversiloba). In the more mesic mixed oak forest, canyon live oak is a codominant with interior live oak, California black oak, bigleaf maple, and California-laurel (17). Above the foothill woodland zone, canyon live oak is a codominant in the mixed oak-evergreen forest where it associates with ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and California black oak. Still higher in elevation in the mixed conifer forest, canyon live oak occurs in small groves with an understory of poison-oak and swordfern (Polystichum munitum), or in groves of mixed oak. It is also an understory small tree or shrub in the lower portion of the mixed conifer forests (17). In the Transverse Range of southern California, canyon live oak is an important subdominant of the yellow pine forest on steep, south-facing slopes where it associates with ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), and California black oak. In moister, cooler areas, canyon live oak is the major dominant in the stable bigcone Douglas-fir-canyon live oak forests (13). Canyon live oak is also found in the western juniper woodlands where it is associated with Jeffrey pine, singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), California black oak, and curlleaf cercocarpus (Cercocarpus ledifolius). Woodland chaparral is the only chaparral type in which canyon live oak is consistently present; it grows with manzanita, ceanothus, birchleaf cercocarpus, interior live oak, and scrub oak (11). Throughout California, canyon live oak is an associate in the cypress groves of Santa Cruz cypress (Cupressus goveniana var. abramsiana), Tecate cypress (C. guadalupensis var. forbesii), Sargent cypress (C. sargentii), and Cuyamaca cypress (C. arizonica var. stephensonii). It is associated with singleleaf pinyon in the eastern-southern Sierra Nevada. In the Mojave Desert, canyon live oak is a minor associate of the montane white fir forests (1). In Arizona, canyon live oak is a minor climax species in the montane Douglas-fir and pinyon forests. It is an understory component in pure stands of Douglas-fir. At lower elevations, it is also a major shrub in oak-chaparral communities, associated with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana), buckthorn cercocarpus, silk-tassel bush (Garrya flavescens), Gregg ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii), and manzanita (17). In Baja California, Mexico, canyon live oak is found in three habitats: in a scrub-chaparral type, as a shrub associated with manzanita and buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.); in groves on steep canyon slopes, as a small tree associated with Baja oak (Quercus peninsularis), buckthorn, manzanita, and ceanothus; and at higher elevations, as a small tree in Jeffrey pine forests (17).",Associated Forest Cover,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,1,0
"Populations of canyon live oak receive more than 2790 mm (110 in) of precipitation in the northern portion of their range to less than 300 mm (12 in) in southern California. Interior populations receive from 810 mm (32 in) in the Sierra Nevada to 150 mm (6 in) in the desert mountains. Most of the annual precipitation in the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada is winter rain. In the desert mountains, half the precipitation is received in summer, the other half in winter. In the northern portion of the range of canyon live oak, the mean temperature in summer ranges from 20° to 23° C (68° to 74° F) and in winter, from 3° to 5° C (37° to 41° F); in the southern portion, from 21° to 25° C (70° to 77° F) in summer and from 5° to 7° C (41° to 45° F) in winter. The frost-free period varies from 160 to 230 days throughout the range (1).",Climate,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,2,0
"Considerable ecological and morphological diversity has been reported for canyon live oak throughout its range. The ecological diversity has not actually been determined; however, its occurrence over a broad range of elevations and geographical, topographical, edaphic, and vegetational conditions indicates considerable ecological variability. Throughout the Coast Ranges of California, a variety of canyon live oak has been recognized Quercus chrysolepis Liebm. var. nana (Jepson) Jepson. Apparently this morphological variety is an ecotypic shrubby form of canyon live oak found in the fire chaparral types. At high elevations, the shrubby forms are hybrids between canyon live oak and huckleberry oak (Q. vaccinifolia). On the California Channel Islands, canyon live oak hybridizes with the endemic island live oak (Q. tomentella), and in Arizona it hybridizes with Dunn oak (Q. dunnii) (17).",Genetics,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,7,0
"Canyon live oak is found in the Coast Ranges and Cascade Range of Oregon and in the Sierra Nevada in California, from latitude 43° 85° N. in southern Oregon to latitude 31° 00° N. in Baja California, Mexico (9,15). In southern Oregon, it grows on the interior side of the Coast Ranges and on the lower slopes of the Cascade Range. It grows throughout the Klamath Mountains of northern California, along the coastal mountains and the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, and east of the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest on the coast, except in the King Range, where it grows close to the coast. In central and southern California, canyon live oak is found on or near the summits of mountains. Scattered populations appear in the mountains of southern Nevada, Arizona, and northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico (17). -The native range of canyon live oak.",Native Range,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Canyon live oak trees begin to produce flowers at the age of 15 to 20 years. It is monoecious; both male and female flowers are borne on the same tree throughout the crown. The male flowers are in tawny, slender, tomentose catkins 5 to 10 cm (1.95 to 3.90 in) long. The female flowers are solitary or occasionally short, sparsely flowered spikes, tawny with bright red stigmas. The pollen is dispersed by the wind at the time the flowers are receptive. The uniform scattering of male and female flowers throughout the crown is apparently effective in inhibiting selfing. Flowering and pollination occur from May to June, usually later than associated conifers. Seed Production and Dissemination- The acorns are ellipsoidal, light chestnut brown, 2.5 to 5.1 cm (I to 2 in) long and 13 to 19 mm. (0.5 to 0.75 in) wide. They are enclosed only at the base with a thick, shallow cup covered with golden tomentum. Cleaned seeds vary from 110 to 310/kg (50 to 150/lb). Acorn crops vary from light to heavy (4). Dry weight yields of fallen acorns in dense stands of canyon live oak range from 10 to 2195 kg/ha (9 to 1,960 lb/acre). A few open-grown trees produce large seed crops, up to 181 kg (400 lb) of acorns per tree (23). Some trees bear acorns every year; the interval between good seed crops varies from 2 to 4 years. In dense stands, trees in sprout clumps usually produce fewer acorns than larger single trees. The acorns mature in one season and fall to the ground in October. The large, heavy acorns are usually dispersed within a short distance of the tree (13). An occasional acorn, however, may roll a considerable distance down the steep canyon walls of its normal habitat. Animals and birds gathering food disseminate the acorn over wide distances. Seedling Development- In stands of canyon live oak, seedling regeneration can be very dense and evenly distributed. Seedlings show little seedbed preference, but they do best under an overstory or on the shaded overstory fringe. The best seedbed is moist soil covered with leaf litter. Few uncovered acorns germinate. Germination is hypogeal, and a short, cold stratification pretreatment helps to break dormancy. Germination occurs in early spring, and the percentage of seed germinating is moderate. The juvenile root penetrates moist soil rapidly, and survival is high under the shade of dense stands. Competition from grass can cause a complete failure in dry years. Early seedling growth is slow, and large numbers of seedlings accumulate in some stands (7,13). Vegetative Reproduction- Canyon live oak reproduces by sprouts that develop from dormant buds under the bark at the base of trees. Sprouts may form after a minor injury, such as browsing, or when the aerial parts of a tree are destroyed by fire or harvesting (21). Sprouts develop from any size tree or shrub immediately after an injury. Older, less vigorous trees may produce only stool sprouts or none. The size and vigor of the parent tree or shrub determine the early height growth and number of sprouts per clump. Sprout development is greater on larger, more vigorous parent trees. Sprout growth of 0.5 to 1 m (1.6 to 3.3 ft) has been measured the first year. The number of sprouts per clump is gradually reduced as growth is concentrated on the dominant members. When nearly 100 years old, a parent tree may have three to five stems per clump. Individual stems in these clumps are seldom as large as single trees (13).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Growth from sapling stage to maturity is slow. In dense, mature stands where oaks are associated with conifers, heights of canyon live oak range from 18 to 30 in (60 to 100 ft), and trunks are straight and free of branches for 6 to 12 in (20 to 40 ft). Trees may reach 152 cm (60 in) in d.b.h. (3). In open situations, canyon live oak grows less in height but has a large dome-shaped crown as wide as 38 in (125 ft). In mature stands of canyon live oak, basal areas reach 125 m²/ha (545 ft²/acre); most stems are in the 50- to 70-cm (20- to 28-in) diameter class. The mean volume of sampled stands in California was 105 m³/ha (1,503 ft³/acre) with a maximum volume of 289 m³/ha (4,128 W/acre) (2). Rooting Habit- Canyon live oak has rapidly growing, deeply penetrating juvenile roots. At maturity in coarse-textured soils, it is deep rooted with a pronounced taproot. In very rocky soils, the roots may be shallow and cover a large area, with occasional large roots extending for some distance near the surface. Reaction to Competition- Canyon live oak is tolerant of shade and has a higher degree of drought tolerance than associated oaks. In the southern portion of its range, it has the ability to germinate and grow at a slow rate under dense stands of other species. Most stands free of recent major disturbance have trees of all sizes and all ages. In the Coast Ranges of central California, canyon live oak reproduces under woodland stands of blue oak, valley oak (Quercus lobata), and coast live oak where fire is excluded (8). In the northern portion of its range, canyon live oak is less tolerant of shade than its associates in the mixed evergreen forests-tanoak, giant chinkapin, and Douglas-fir-and is usually more tolerant than Pacific madrone. Canyon live oak occurs as an early successional shrub or tree on good sites but is soon outgrown by its associates and eliminated from a stand. On drier, more open sites, it persists in the climax forest as a subordinate tree and shrub (10,16,20). Only on very rocky, steep canyon walls does it occur as a dominant in the climax forest. As sawtimber, canyon live oak is best managed in even-aged stands, mixed with different conifers: ponderosa pine in the northern portion of its range, Digger pine in the central Coast Ranges, and Coulter pine and bigcone Douglas-fir in southern California. Closed canopies should be maintained at all times, because open-grown canyon live oak tend to develop short boles, poor form, and excessive crowns with large branches. Maximum production of biomass for fuelwood can be achieved in pure, even-aged coppice stands. Damaging Agents- Canyon live oak seedlings and saplings are browsed by deer. In some areas, as many as 40 percent of all seedlings were browsed (8). In most situations, however, growth is not seriously retarded. Young stands of canyon live oak are relatively vulnerable to ground and crown fires. The combustion of ground fuels and brush during light fires singes and kills the crown foliage and burns through the thin, flaky bark. Repeated fires tend to convert canyon live oak trees to shrubs (18). In southern California, crown-sprouting associates-such as coast live oak and bigcone Douglas-fir-remain as trees after repeated fires, whereas canyon live oak becomes a shrub (14). Little insect damage has been observed on canyon live oak compared with other oaks. Occasional localized damage is caused by California oakworm (Phryganidia californica) in wet years; in dry years ' the Pacific oak twig girdler (Agrilus angelicus) causes some damage. Other insects reported to do minor damage on canyon live oak are Pacific tent caterpillar (Malacosoma constrictum), western tussock moth (Orgyia vetusta), carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), ribbedcase maker (Bucculatrix albertiella), oak bark beetles (Pseudopityophthorus sp.), and a false powderpost beetle (Melalgus confertus) (3). Acorns are destroyed by the filbert weevil (Curculio uniformis) and the filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus) (22). Often entire crops are riddled by insects. During some years an entire crop of acorns is used as food by squirrels, deer, and birds.

"Canyon live oak is found on many types of soil. In the northern part of its range, this oak often dominates on steep, shallow, rocky, infertile soils having little soil development. On deep, coarse-textured soils, canyon live oak is usually secondary in importance to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus). On deep, fine-textured soils, canyon live oak is normally a small shrub under an overstory canopy of associated species. In northwestern California, canyon live oak grows on sedimentary, metasedimentary, granitic, serpentine, and periodite parent materials. In southern California, it is a dominant on a broad range of soils from shallow and poorly developed to deep and well developed (13). Canyon live oak is most commonly found on soils of the orders Inceptisols and Alfisols. Canyon live oak grows at elevations of 488 to 1525 in (1,600 to 5,000 ft) in southwestern Oregon; in northern California, from 90 to 1370 in (300 to 4,500 ft); and in southern California, up to 2740 in (9,000 ft). As its name implies, canyon live oak is often the dominant tree on steep canyon walls. In areas of moderate to high precipitation, it is found on southerly aspects, and in the drier parts of its range, on northerly aspects.",Soils and Topography,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,15,0
"Canyon live oak was one of the woods most commonly used by early California settlers for farm implements, shipbuilding, furniture, and fuel. The common name maul oak came from its use as a splitting maul (5). Canyon live oak has been considered a non-manageable hardwood; however, its high caloric value and rapid sprout growth make it an excellent source of fuelwood. Manufactured into paneling, the wood makes an attractive multicolored interior wall covering. Open-grown trees with their wide crowns of evergreen leaves make attractive urban trees. The ability of canyon live oak to grow on steep, rocky, moving slopes makes it an excellent stabilizer of soils on steep slopes. Montane hardwood forests dominated by canyon live oak provide habitat and food for a large variety of wildlife. The acorns are an important source of food for scrub and Steller's jays, acorn woodpecker, band-tailed pigeon, wild turkey, mountain quail, ground squirrel, woodrat, black bear, and mule deer. Deer also use the foliage as food. Many amphibians and reptiles are found in these forests (12,22).",Special Uses,Canyon Live Oak,quercus,chrysolepis,hardwood,16,0
"Sites preferred by Carolina silverbell, the most mesic with the best soils, are those on which a number of hardwoods reach their best development. Consequently, it is found in association with a large number of hardwood species as well as occasionally with conifers. In Piedmont areas, the species is associated with yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), red maple (Acer rubrum), white oak Quercus alba), American holly (Ilex opaca), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), and bigleaf magnolia (Magnolia macrophylla). In the southern part of its range it occurs with American beech (Fagus grandifolia), southern magnolia (M. grandiflora), American holly, various oaks, cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), Florida maple (Acer barbatum), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and eastern redbud (4). In the Black Mountains of North Carolina, Carolina silverbell is a significant associate in the northern hardwoods climax association at high elevations and in the cove climax and mesic slope associations at mid-elevations (10). It occurs and may share canopy dominance with eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), white basswood (Tilia heterophylla), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) in the Great Smoky Mountains and the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest (20,24,25,35). Prominent associates of the species in a gorge in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina were northern red oak Quercus rubra), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), sweet birch (Betula lenta), yellow-poplar, flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and Fraser magnolia (Magnolia fraseri). Carolina silverbell is associated with the following forest cover types (Society of American Foresters) (13): 23 Eastern Hemlock 24 Eastern Hemlock-Yellow Birch 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 26 Sugar Maple-Basswood 27 Sugar Maple 28 Black Cherry-Maple 57 Yellow-Poplar 58 Yellow-Poplar-Eastern Hemlock 59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak 60 Beech-Sugar Maple 74 Cabbage Palmetto 76 Shortleaf Pine-Oak 82 Loblolly Pine-Hardwood 87 Sweetgum-Yellow-Poplar 91 Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak",Associated Forest Cover,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,1,0
"The climate over the range of Carolina silverbell is superhumid in the southern Appalachians and humid in the other areas, with temperatures that vary considerably with latitude and elevation. Average annual precipitation varies between 1020 mm and 1140 min (40 and 45 in) in the northern part of the range to more than 2030 min (80 in) in the southern Appalachians. Precipitation is well distributed over the year. Average January temperatures range from -1° to 13° C (30° to 55° F) and average July temperatures range from 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F). The average annual maximum temperatures range from 32° to 41° C (90° to 105° F) and the average minimum from -4° to -21° C (25° to -50 F).

"The first published description of Carolina silverbell appeared in 1731 in Mark Catesby's Natural History of Carolina (17). Linnaeus made a taxonomic description of it in 1759 and named it Halesia carolina L. There is evidence that the specimen used by Linnaeus may have been a different species; nevertheless, Halesia carolina is the name currently accepted. The genus has two other species with limited distribution in the southeastern and southern Piedmont and Coastal Plain. They are H. parviflora Michx. and H. diptera Ellis. All have n=12 chromosomes (7,9,27,31). No studies on population differences in this species have been reported. However, its wide and discontinuous distribution likely has produced significant variation among and within populations over its range. The large form of Carolina silverbell that grows in the southern Appalachian Mountains was at one time considered to be a separate species from the smaller form that occupies the rest of the range. It was given the name H. monticola (Rehd.) Sarg. but it differs from the smaller form only in size, and recent authors consider it synonymous with H. carolina (7,11,20,34). Intergradation between H. carolina L. and H. parviflora Michx. (little silverbell) is suspected in the northern Coastal Plain where their distributions overlap (7).",Genetics,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,7,0
"Carolina silverbell grows mostly in the Piedmont and mountains of the Carolinas, eastern Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. Its distribution extends beyond this central area, however, in small populations scattered over the southeastern Coastal Plain, western Virginia, West Virginia, southern Ohio, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, central Arkansas, and southeastern Oklahoma (6,27,30). The species has been successfully cultivated as far north as southern New England, in California, and in Europe (16,17,30). -The native range of Carolina silverbell.",Native Range,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Carolina silverbell has perfect flowers which appear as the leaves begin to expand in March to May, depending upon location (8,24,30). Each flower has a four-celled ovary, but usually only one cell produces a viable seed (15,17). Larger flower crops are produced annually after the 20th to 25th year (17). The fruit is a dry, oblong, four-winged drupe that matures in the fall. Seed Production and Dissemination- Large seed crops are produced annually by older trees of Carolina silverbell but much of the seed is sterile. The fruits are persistent and dissemination occurs well into the winter. The seeds are dormant to varying degrees at maturity and require special handling to break the dormancy. They require 2 to 3 months of warm, moist storage at 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F) followed by a similar period of cold stratification at 1° to 5° C (34° to 41° F). Even with this treatment, germination of filled seeds may be 50 percent or lower (1,15). Seeds disseminated in nature or sowed in a nursery without special treatment germinate mostly during the second growing season (11). Fruits to be stored should be kept dry and cold, but no data are available on long-term storage (5). Seedling Development- Germination of Carolina silverbell seeds is epigeal. Seedlings grow to about 12 cm (5 in) the first 7 weeks. Growth continues at a moderate rate for a few years, then slows considerably (17). Vegetative Reproduction- Carolina silver bell can easily be propagated by root and greenwood cuttings and by air-layering. Rooting hormones are not necessary for success but may enhance rooting at certain times of the year. For best success, cuttings should be taken after elongation of new growth but before hardening beings. Roots should not be disturbed until the end of the second season. Micropropagation techniques are being developed (1,3,11,17).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Over most of its range, Carolina silverbell (fig. 3) is an understory shrub or small tree usually reaching heights of 6 to 12 in (20 to 40 ft) with a crown spread of 4.5 to 9 in (15 to 30 ft) and stem diameters of 12 to 27 cm (5 to 11 in). On good sites in the Great Smoky Mountains, however, some trees reach 30 m (100 ft) in height and 90 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. Only on cove and north slope sites in the mountains do trees of this species maintain crown positions in the upper canopy and reach large sawtimber size (8,12,23,24). Growth rates of individual trees are moderate to slow, the smaller ones showing 6 to 9 rings per centimeter (15 to 23/in) (12,17,24). No data are available on volumes per unit area, but the species could be expected to contribute significant volumes to the mixed hardwood stands only on the best sites in the mountains. Estimated total cubic volumes in 1980 in the mountains of three States are as follows (19): Rooting Habit- The rooting habit of Carolina silverbell has not been studied, but the root systems are known to be very persistent, because stumps sprout repeatedly when trees are cut from pastures (8). Reaction to Competition- Carolina silverbell grows as an understory tree over most of its range and as a codominant in the mountains. It is classed as a shade-tolerant tree. A moist, loamy, partially shaded soil makes the best seedbed for either natural or artificial regeneration, although the species has been found with mixed hardwoods which regenerated a large, burned area in eastern Tennessee (7,23,24,26). In hemlock stands in western North Carolina, the species occurred with greater frequency on areas without a rhododendron cover than with (25). It competes well with other species regenerating in gaps left by treefalls in Southern Appalachian forests (29,36). Damaging Agents- Carolina silverbell appears to be free of serious insect pests or diseases (17,23).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,14,0
"Soils over the range of Carolina silverbell are mostly Ultisols but include sandy Entisols in the Southeast, Inceptisols in the mountains, and Mollisols in southern Illinois (32). The species prefers rich, moist, well-drained, loamy soil that is slightly acid in reaction (pH 5.0 to 6.0). It can tolerate soils more acid than that and may do well in soils with a pH up to 7.0 (11,23). Carolina silverbell grows mostly along streams, river bluffs, and ravine slopes in the Piedmont and other lowlands and along streams, in coves, and on moist lower slopes in the mountains (4,8,10,24, 28,30). It is significant in frequency at elevations between 1370 and 1680 in (4,500 and 5,500 ft) and locally abundant at elevations between 460 and 1370 in (1,500 and 4,500 ft) in the mountains (10,25).",Soils and Topography,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,15,0
"The wood of Carolina silverbell has many fine properties which make it very desirable for veneer, cabinet work, carving, and turning. It is a favorite wood of craftsmen who make woodenware for the tourist trade. The wood is soft with white or creamy sapwood and light cherry-colored heartwood streaked with white. Wood from larger trees has been sold as cherry or birch and the wood is acceptable for pulping along with other hardwood species. In the tourist trade it is sold under such names as bellwood, tisswood, and boxelder (14,17,18,26). Squirrels use Carolina silverbell seeds for food and the trees for dens. The heavy flower crops in spring are very attractive to bees, and eastern Tennessee beekeepers speak highly of the species as a honey plant (12,22,33). Carolina silverbell is best known for its ornamental qualities. Its heavy crop of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring and its small to medium growth habit make it a favorite for small gardens, lawns, patios, and tubs. It was first cultivated in 1756 and since has been successfully cultivated in the Eastern United States, California, and western and central Europe (23,30). It transplants well as balled and burlapped or container-grown stock (11). Its best ornamental uses include border plantings in combination with low-growing plants such as azaleas, at corners of buildings and against a background of large evergreens. Its blooms can best be seen from below, so the tree needs to be conveniently accessible. Sprays of the flowers go well with cut-flower arrangements (2,16,19,34). The large form from the mountains should not be used in small gardens but can be used with delightful results for street plantings, although it is not quite as hardy as the smaller form. Some trees have predominantly pink flowers, but a shady site may be required to produce this trait (11,20,34).",Special Uses,Carolina Silverbell,halesia,carolina,hardwood,16,0
"The geographic seed origins of casuarina in Florida are not known. Although trees characteristic of each species can be readily located, classification of individual trees is sometimes difficult because a high degree of hybridization is presumed. The three species are found together in much of south Florida and have compatible flowering times. A C. cunninghamiana x C. glauca hybrid has grown faster than any of the three species (1). Studies of individual tree collections of C. cunninghamiana and C. equisetifolia from four areas in south Florida do not indicate differences among trees, sources, or species for survival through 6 months (16).",Genetics,Casuarina,casuarina,casaurina,hardwood,7,0
"Casuarina equisetifolia and C. cunninghamiana are naturalized to the southwestern and southeastern coastal areas of Florida as far north as Tampa and Titusville, with C. equisetifolia particularly prevalent on beaches; C.glauca is present throughout the same general area, frequently as very dense stands along roads and fence lines. Casuarina cunninghamiana exists as planted trees as far north as Gainesville. In Hawaii, C. equisetifolia is common along sandy coasts and lowlands (9). In Australia, these species grow in the tropical and subtropical north and east: C. cunninghamiana along rivers, C. glauca in swamps, and C. equisetifolia along the coast. In Florida, C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca have a wide tolerance for moisture regimes, as they are present on sites ranging from dry to very wet but not permanently flooded. Casuarina equisetifolia performs well on dry sites only; C.glauca appears to be the most frost hardy, although it will not withstand long periods below freezing, and C.cunninghamiana is intermediate in frost tolerance. There seem to be no climatic barriers to sexual reproduction. All three Casuarina species prefer coarse-textured soils of the Entisol, Inceptisol, and Spodosol orders. They show wide latitude in their soil demands and range from dry, sandy beach ridges to wet lake margins, but they withstand inundation for short periods only. In southeastern Florida, the species are particularly prevalent on alkaline, lime stone-derived soils. Casuarina equisetifolia is tolerant of very saline conditions but grows best in slightly acid sandy soils. All three species tolerate low soil fertility but are quite responsive to fertilization with phosphorus or nitrogen and phosphorus. They reach maximum development in slightly depressional topography where adequate moisture is nearly always available. When casuarina is present through natural seeding in Florida, it tends to form pure stands that are often nearly devoid of other vegetation (4). It may coexist with vegetation such as Florida fishpoisontree (Piscidia piscipula), button-mangrove (Conocarpus erectus), myrsine (Rapanea punctata), stopper (Eugenia spp.), randia (Randia spp.), cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), redbay (Persea borbonia), and Florida poisontree (Metopium toxiferum) (3).",Habitat,Casuarina,casuarina,casaurina,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Casuarina species have been reported to be monoecious (13) and dioecious (6); C. glauca in Florida has not been observed to bear female flowers. Flowering occurs principally from April to June, with numerous minute narrow and terminal male flowers crowded in rings among grayish scales, and rounded and lateral female flowers occurring in light-brown clusters (9,13). Female flowers are wind pollinated. The multiple fruit, gray brown and 8 to 15 mm (0.3 to 0.6 in) in diameter, ripen from September through December. Seed bearing usually begins by age 5, and good seed crops occur annually (13). Seed Production and Dissemination- The conelike fruits mature throughout the year, although heavier crops occur in the fall and winter. When the fruits dry from December to March, the samaras, which range in length from 3 to 8 mm (0.1 to 0.3 in), depending on species (14), are released and wind disseminated. Germination of the seeds is epigeal and good on moist, bare soil. Seeds may be extracted readily from air-dried fruits. Cleaned seed yields range from 661,000 to 1,653,000/kg (300,000 to 750,000/lb) depending on species and location (13). Germination of seeds stored for 2 years under conditions ranging from 6 to 16 percent moisture content and -7° to 3° C (20° to 38° F) can be from 40 to 50 percent (7). No pregermination treatment is required (13). Broadcast sowing of seeds, followed by a thin topping of soil or other nursery medium sufficient to give 215 to 323 seedlings/m² (20 to 30/ft²), can result in outplantable seedlings within 3 months. Seedling development is partly dependent on the presence of a symbiont, the filamentous actinomycete Frankia spp., which allows casuarina to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Inoculation of nursery-grown seedlings is therefore advisable. This can be accomplished by application of a 10 percent suspension of ground casuarina root nodules with water to the nursery medium (11,18). Seedling Development- Under proper conditions, growth of casuarina seedlings is extremely rapid, with growth rates of more than 2 m (6.5 ft) possible the first year. Such rates of growth are observed only when no competing herbaceous vegetation is present and may be possible only when the seedlings have been inoculated with Frankia spp., as noted earlier (11). Vegetative Reproduction- The three species show different levels of root suckering: C. glauca root suckers prolifically; C. cunninghamiana, infrequently; and C. equisetifolia, not at all. Rooting success, as evidenced by preliminary trials with fine branches from lower to middle portions of crowns, is satisfactory for C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca but low for C. equisetifolia. Use of rootone and a sand medium typically resulted in rooting as high as 50 percent in the spring. Grafting appears to be successful (1). Growth and Yield- Early growth is rapid, and height increments exceeding 1.5 m (5 ft) per year are common. Mature trees in stands of C. cunninghamiana and C. equisetifolia may reach 32 m (105 ft) in height and 41 cm (16 in) in d.b.h.; more commonly, heights of 25 m (82 ft) and diameters of 25 cm (10 in) are attained. Initial survival rates for planted trees are acceptable, averaging over 87 percent. One 35-year-old stand of C. glauca had a basal area of 90 m²/ha (392 ft²/acre) composed of trees averaging 19 m (62 ft) in height and 14 cm (5.5 in) in d.b.h. Total aboveground dry biomass yields of young natural stands of C. equisetifolia have been as high as 16.6 t/ha (7.4 tons/acre) per year. Such stands, with densities up to 11,400 trees per hectare (4,600/acre), have trees ranging from 0.6 to 18 cm. (0.25 to 7 in) in d.b.h., with an average of 4.3 cm (1.7 in) at an estimated age of 7.5 years. Rooting Habit- Casuarina has a spreading, fibrous root system that can penetrate quite deeply into the soil if subsurface moisture is available. A very dense mat of adventitious roots may be formed in response to wet conditions. The root hairs become infected by Frankia spp. and form nitrogen-fixing nodules (18). Reaction to Competition- Casuarina species are intolerant of shade but capable of rapidly invading new sites and forming pure stands. When young, trees are easily suppressed by some forms of competing vegetation, especially grasses and sedges, particularly if seedlings are not nodulated and cannot fix atmospheric nitrogen. On a well-prepared palmetto prairie in Florida, for example, newly planted casuarina seedlings failed to survive competition from wiregrass (Aristida stricta) that rapidly reinvaded the site. In the Philippines and in the Highlands of Papua, New Guinea, however, casuarina seedlings have been reported to compete aggressively against Imperata grass, a weed that makes large areas of the tropics useless for agriculture (12). Once casuarina trees dominate a site, however, their heavy root mat and the deep litter layer tend to reduce, even eliminate, competitors. Damaging Agents- Casuarina appears to have relatively few insect problems. The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) is harmful only to small trees; damage by the leaf notcher weevil (Artipus floridanus) usually is inconsequential; and one species of spittlebug (Clastoptera undulata) appears to infest individual trees but causes no serious damage (2). The Australian pine borer (Chrysobothris tranquebarica) has on occasion devastated trees 5 years or less in age by girdling the stems (17). The major biological cause of death of casuarina on well-drained, acid, sandy soils is a mushroom root rot (Clitocybe tabescens) (15); Casuarina cunninghamiana may be less susceptible than the other species. The incidence of root rot is reduced on wetter sites, with no evidence of the disease in alkaline soils. Primary nonbiological losses are from lightning and frost. Killing lightning strikes are common to casuarina that are dominant in the south Florida landscape. Freezing temperatures can damage well-established trees; temperatures of approximately -8° C (18° F) kill trees less than 0.5 m (1.6 ft) in height.",Life History,Casuarina,casuarina,casaurina,hardwood,10,0
"No commercial use is made of casuarina in Florida, although its pulping properties are acceptable (5) and reputed to be better than those of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) (8). The species have been widely used for shelterbelts and in landscaping as hedges and ornamentals (1); C. glauca has been frequently planted for soil stabilization near drainage ditches and lakeshores. The species are well suited for fuelwood because of their fast growth rates, coppicing potential, and desirable wood properties. Their wood densities of approximately 0.72 are among the highest for Florida trees, their green wood moisture content is relatively low at 60 to 88 percent on an ovendry basis, and their whole-tree energy values are considerably higher than those of other species (16). The ash content is slightly higher than that of most native American woods, averaging about 2 percent; the ash content of bark is twice this amount. The wood dries rapidly and burns well. Attempts to saw and season casuarina for use as lumber have not been satisfactory (10). Casuarina bark has been used in tanning and medicine, and the fruits have been used for novelties and decorations (13).",Special Uses,Casuarina,casuarina,casaurina,hardwood,16,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Cedar elm flowers from August to September and fruit ripens from September to October (19). However, flowering dates have been reported as early as July and fruiting as late as November (20). When flowers appear in August, fruit ripens in September, and then a second flowering and fruiting may occur in October and November, respectively (15). Flowers are in fascicles of three to five on slender, pubescent pedicels 8 to 13 mm (0.31 to 0.51 in) long, located in the axils of the leaves. The hairy, red-to-green calyx is divided beyond the middle into four to eight equal and acute lobes, and the stamen is composed of five or six slender filaments and reddish purple anthers. Flowers are perfect (19). Seed Production and Dissemination- The green fruit, or samara, is oblong and flattened, deeply notched at the apex, 6 to 13 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in) long, and pubescent, especially along the margins. The seed within is unsymmetrical, acute, and covered with a dark chestnut-brown coat. Cleaned seeds average 147,700/kg (67,000/lb). Dissemination is by wind and germination occurs the following spring. Seedling Development- Air-dried seeds may be stored at 4° C (39° F) for at least I year. Stratification at 5° C (41° F) for 60 to 90 days before sowing can improve germination. The seeds should be covered with soil about 5 mm (0.2 in) deep. Germination is epigeal. Approximately 5 to 12 percent of the viable seed produce plantable stock (19). The seedlings can usually be outplanted after one growing season in the nursery. Vegetative Reproduction- Cedar elm is commonly grown from seed. Though no reference is made to species in the literature, cedar elm can probably be propagated vegetatively like other elms by layering, air-layering, and from greenwood cuttings.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Cedar Elm,ulmus,crassifolia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Cedar elm is classified as a medium to large tree. Reports of height at maturity range from 6 m (20 ft) in the Edwards Plateau of Texas to near 30 m (98 ft) (2,4). The national champion big tree from Limestone County, TX, is 28.7 m (94 ft) tall. Mature trees average approximate 90 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. Cedar elm has an unusual cross-section that may be triangular, almost square, or deeply irregularly scalloped. The annual growth rings are very indistinct. Thus there may be considerable error in estimating the average growth rate (3). In the early 1950's the Southern Forest Experiment Station estimated a volume of about 5.7 million m³ (1 billion fbm) in the total United States area (4). Rooting Habit- The tree is relatively shallow rooted in early life. It is resistant to root pruning in the nursery. In later life the trees are moderately tolerant of soil compaction or disturbance of the root systems (21). Reaction to Competition- The literature contains no information on tolerance of cedar elm to vegetative competition or tolerance to shade, drought, or other physiological stresses. Observation of seedlings and of crown class, however, strongly suggests that cedar elm should be classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. Damaging Agents- Cedar elm is susceptible to the Dutch elm disease caused by the fungus Ceratocystis ulmi, which is carried chiefly by the native elm bark beetle (Hylurgopinus rufipes) and also by the smaller European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatus). The disease does not seem to be as harmful to cedar elm as to the American elm (Ulmus americana). The offspring of U. crassifolia x parvifolia crosses indicated an apparent increase in disease resistance (14). A vascular wilt easily confused with Dutch elm disease and harmful to cedar elm is caused by Ceratocystis ulmi. Again, cedar elm is not as susceptible to the disease as is American elm. In Mississippi, only 8.5 percent of 25 large trees 18 cm (7 in) in d.b.h. and larger and 1 percent of 132 small trees 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. and smaller were affected by the disease, as opposed to 37 percent of the large and 5.7 percent of the small American elms (8). Cedar elm also has been found fairly resistant to Texas root rot (Phymatotrichum omnivorum) (9), but only slightly resistant or nonresistant to heartwood decay caused by several species of Fomes and Polyporus (18). The symptoms of elm phloem necrosis caused by the mycoplasmalike organism Morsus ulmi have been suppressed in American and cedar elm by injections of tetracycline antibiotic (7). In Texas, Spanish moss (Tilliandsia usneoides) frequently drapes the branches of cedar elm; it weakens the branches and may kill the tree (15). The elm leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta luteola) is hosted by all species of elm throughout the United States, but it causes only occasional, slight damage to cedar elm (1).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Cedar Elm,ulmus,crassifolia,hardwood,14,0
"Cedar elm thrives in deep rich soils (Inceptisols) in the Mississippi Delta and along streams in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, where it becomes a large tree along the Colorado and Brazos Rivers (2,15). Cedar elm grows on dense, poorly drained clay soils (Vertisols) in central Texas. It also can be found on dry limestone hills in Texas and Oklahoma, but the tree is small and scrubby in this environment.",Soils and Topography,Cedar Elm,ulmus,crassifolia,hardwood,15,0
"The seeds are part of the diet of several bird species. In south Texas, 10 percent of the diet of the plain chachalaca consists of cedar elm seeds (11). Wild turkey in Texas use elm seeds and buds for 5 to 10 percent of their diet (12). In addition, squirrels eat the buds. Cedar elm is frequently planted as an ornamental shade tree in Oklahoma and Texas (21). Cedar elm flowers about the same time as the ragweeds and is known to cause or to complicate later summer hayfever (5). The wood is known for its great strength and exceptionally good shock resistance. Its specific gravity and shrinkage are quite similar to those of rock elm (Ulmus thomasii) (4). Because their wood is anatomically similar, cedar elm, rock elm, winged elm, and September elm (U. serotina) are all classified as ""rock elm."" They are most easily distinguished by differences in the ultraviolet fluorescence of the aqueous extracts of the heartwood (16). Because of its similarity to rock elm, cedar elm can be used as a substitute for rock elm (4). It is most suitable for the manufacturing of furniture and fence posts. The wood also is excellent for steam bending and therefore is used to make containers such as boxes, baskets, crates, and barrels. Other products made from the wood include caskets and dairy, poultry, and apiary supplies. Cedar elm leaves can be used as indicators of the severity of air pollution. The sulfate content of leaf samples shows the long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, which is related to overall pollution levels (13).",Special Uses,Cedar Elm,ulmus,crassifolia,hardwood,16,0
"The genus Cedrela has undergone two major systematic revisions since 1960. The most recent revision reduced the number of species in the genus to seven (53). The common cedro, Cedrela odorata L., embraces 28 other named species, including C.mexicana M. J. Roem. The taxon ""C. angustifolia,"" a very vigorous type now in demand because of its apparent resistance to the shootborer, was left in an indeterminate status due to insufficient herbarium material. The result is that C.odorata as now constituted is a species showing a high degree of population variation. The West Indian material, upon which the original species description was based, is characterized by glabrous foliage with sessile leaflets, whereas the variety (formerly species) ""mexicana"" of Central and South America has varying degrees of pubescence, as well as generally larger leaves with petiolate leaflets, but intermediate varieties exist. Early plantation trials indicated that the variety called ""mexicana"" is faster growing than the West Indian race (59). Recently completed provenance trials (7,8,12,13, 14,15,26,32,33,35,44,46,50,62,65) have suggested that many ecological races of cedro exist. Provenance differences showed up most clearly in African trials, where they were not masked by the adverse effects of the shootborer. Efforts are underway to expand provenance trials to include more seed sources for promising types (12). Smith (51) suggested that the widely distributed species of cedro, C. odorata and C. fissilis, as well as the doubtful taxon C. angustifolia (which he recognized as a separate species), hybridized freely, and that hybrids could explain the great phenotypic variability in these taxa. Unfortunately, there is still no experimental evidence to support or reject the hybridization hypothesis. Recent cytological studies have shown that at least two separate basic diploid chromosome numbers (2n= 50 and 56) occur in C. odorata; this occurrence of different intraspecific chromosomal races seems widespread in the Meliaceae and may inhibit free hybridization (54,56).",Genetics,"Cedro Hembra, Spanish-Ceda",cedrela,ordota,hardwood,7,0
"Cedro is a tree of the New World tropics, appearing in forests of moist and seasonally dry Subtropical or Tropical life zones (24) from latitude 26° N. on the Pacific coast of Mexico, throughout Central America and the West Indies, to the lowlands and foothills of most of South America up to 1200 m (about 4,000 ft) altitude, finding its southern limit at about latitude 28° S. in Argentina (12,55). Cedro is always found naturally on well-drained soils, often but not exclusively on limestone; it tolerates a long dry season but does not flourish in areas of rainfall greater than about 3000 mm (120 in) or on sites with heavy or waterlogged soils (5,34,40,66). Individual trees are generally scattered in mixed semievergreen or semi-deciduous forests dominated by other species (11,23,25,28). Cedro is a climatic generalist, found over a wide geographic range of warm latitudinal belts, from Subtropical Dry Forest (wet transitional part) in Mexico and parts of the West Indies, through Subtropical Moist Forest to Subtropical Wet Forest in the West Indies and Central America, to Tropical Moist and Wet and Tropical Premontane Moist and Wet life zones in the equatorial regions (24). It is most abundant in the lowlands and foothills (other species, C. montana and C. lilloi, replace it at higher elevations) in moist forests. Its distribution is within the frost-free tropics for the most part, although it has been collected at latitudes 26° N. and 28° S., where occasional light frosts can be expected (26,55). Mean temperatures of 23° to 26° C (73° to 79° F) are found in the Caribbean part of its range; in tropical South America mean temperature is slightly higher, 28° C (82° F), with a mean minimum of 23° C (73° F) and a mean maximum of 32° C (90° F). At the southern limit of its range in Argentina the mean temperature is 24° C (75° F); mean maximum temperature is 30° C (86° F) and mean minimum is 18° C (64° F) (16,34,60). Cedro develops best in seasonally dry climates, as reflected in its deciduous habit and its formation of (presumably annual) growth rings. It reaches greatest prominence under an annual rainfall of 1200 to 2400 mm (47.2 to 94.5 in) with a dry season 2 to 5 months long. Both tree growth and reproduction are synchronous with the onset of the rains (40,53). Cedro survives in lower rainfall areas (down to about 1000 mm (40 in) annually) but grows slowly and shows a stunted form (41,59). It also grows sporadically in areas receiving up to 3500 mm (138 in) of rainfall, but only on very well-drained sites (23,52). In Central and South America, in areas with less than 2000 mm (about 80 in) annual rainfall and over limestone-derived soils, cedar may become locally the dominant species (34,57). Cedro may be exacting in its soil requirements but these are still imperfectly understood. In the West Indies it is most commonly found on limestone-derived clay soils (23,35,47), but it also grows on well-drained sites over acid soils derived from volcanic rock (Ultisols). The common denominator appears to be drainage and aeration of the soil (24,52,63), not soil pH (40,64,65). In Trinidad the one factor common to all sites supporting good growth was good surface drainage (10,40). In Mexico and Central America, cedro is likewise common on well-drained soils and ruins (48). Soil fertility may also be important, as in some tests cedro grew better in soil enriched with the burned remains of secondary forest (10,58). No definitive studies of nutrient requirements beyond the seedling stage have been performed (5,63). Symptoms of stress due to poor soils are burned appearance of roots, development of ""weeping willow"" form in saplings (leaves become thin and drooping) or loss of leaves at irregular intervals during the wet season. In Puerto Rico, cedro is found in Subtropical Moist and Subtropical Wet life zones but is commonest in the Subtropical Moist life zone over limestone-derived soils (16,35). Other species commonly found in the tree layer of this association in Puerto Rico are tortugo amarillo (Sideroxylon foetidissimum), sanguinaria (Dipholis salicifolia), moca (Andira inermis), aquilon (Terebraria resinosa), ucar (Bucida buceras), cupey (Clusia rosea), guano (Ochroma pyramidale), maga (Montezuma speciosissima), uvilla (Coccoloba diversifolia), espino rubial (Zanthoxylum martinicense), almacigo (Bursera simaruba), and cedro macho (Hyeronima clusioides). Almost all of these species have a much wider local distribution and greater abundance than cedro itself, however. In the continental part of its range, cedro is often associated with mahogany (Swietenia spp.) in moist and wet forests, but mahogany is usually present in far greater abundance (52). Compared to the closely related mahoganies, cedro is much more exacting in site requirements, especially drainage. Near the high rainfall end of its climatic range, cedro is invariably found on ridgetops, upper slopes, old building ruins, and road banks, or other areas of unusually well aerated soil (23).",Habitat,"Cedro Hembra, Spanish-Ceda",cedrela,ordota,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Cedro's reproductive cycle is synchronized with the growing season of the site; throughout its range it flowers at the beginning of the rainy season: May to August in Mexico, the ,,West Indies, and northern South America (4,30,48); September to October in Argentina (34). Flowering begins when new leaves are expanding. The large and much-branched inflorescences bear numerous small, five-part, symmetrical greenish-white flowers. Trees are monoecious; male and female flowers are borne on the same inflorescence but the species is proterogynous (female flowers open first). Fruit development takes about 9 or 10 months and fruits ripen during the next dry season. Trees begin to fruit at an age of 10 to 12 years. The fruit, a large woody capsule, is borne near branch tips. Fruits ripen, split, and shed seeds while still attached to the parent tree. Seed Production and Dissemination- Fruits open from the top downward to release 40 to 50 winged seeds when ripe. Seed weight is about 8 to 10 percent of dry fruit weight. One kilogram (2.2 lb) contains 20,000 to 50,000 seeds (9,100 to 22,700/lb, approximately). Seeds are 20 to 25 mm (0.75 to 1.0 in) long, wing included, and are wind dispersed. Heavy seed crops are produced annually in some areas and biennially or irregularly in others (41,59). Seeds are shed during the dry season. They lose viability quickly if not stored very dry at reduced temperatures (12,37,38). Germination begins with the onset of the rainy season and is epigeous. Vigorous germination is the rule, with seed viability reportedly up to 90 percent (40). No seed dormancy period is known. Germination is rapid, usually completed within 2 to 4 weeks (37,38). Seedling Development- Early development of the seedling is rapid as long as moisture and light are adequate (5,46,62). Shade-grown seedlings saturate photosynthetically at low intensities and are shade tolerant, but sun-grown seedlings require high light intensities for best growth (27,28,29). Shade-grown seedlings are susceptible to sunscald and subsequent insect attack when moved to sun (43). Fertilizer trials showed best growth with 7-6-19 fertilizer (6). In natural forest, high seedling densities are common near fruiting trees shortly after the beginning of the rainy season, but most of these seedlings disappear by the middle of the rains or a little later; this high natural mortality may be due to shade or competition but is thought to be partly due to damping off or other root problems (40). Seedlings and saplings have extremely shallow root systems and are sensitive to uprooting and root trampling (10). Seedlings average 1 in (3.3 ft) in growth and develop a stem diameter of 10 mm (0.4 in) or more during the first year under favorable conditions (table 1). Early growth is vigorous under partial shade, when the shootborer attack is not severe (8,51,62). Natural cedro regeneration from seed is good in many parts of Central and South America, but good initial growth is often followed by dieback after 2 to 3 years. This problem may be only partially related to the shootborer and may also reflect the scarcity of appropriate soils, especially in some of the areas subjected to most intensive study. The abundance of cedro regrowth as almost pure stands with no apparent shootborer problems on recent and ancient limestone ruins in areas with a strong dry season (52) suggests that cedro may be a calciphile. In some parts of the neotropics selective removal of seed trees has left the forest with insufficient stock for natural regeneration, even on favorable sites. Some success has been claimed for artifical regeneration using the taungya method (a system using native farmers who plant the trees interspersed with their food crops, abandoning the field later to return to forest, now enriched with the desired plantation species); line plantings followed by natural liberation are also used (11,42,58). Successful establishment by the taungya system has been achieved in Africa, where extensive areas of well-drained soils are present, and the native shootborer does not attack New World cedro (34). Vegetative Reproduction- Cedro does not coppice readily nor produce root suckers; it is not fire resistant (5,40). It is capable of pollard regrowth (partial terminal regrowth after moderate wind damage or partial dieback) if the tree is well established. It can be grafted and air-layered (34,40,56). Growth and Yield- Growth data for many plantations are summarized in table 2. Once past the vulnerable early sapling stage, cedro is a very fast-growing tree, adding 2.5 cm (1.0 in) or more in diameter and 2 in (6.6 ft) in height a year under good conditions. Provenance differences in height growth show up most clearly in Africa, where shootborer attacks are not a problem (44). Fast-growing saplings develop straight, clean boles and narrow, thin crowns. The light-demanding saplings escape shootborer attack in 3 to 4 years if robust, and subsequent growth is rapid on favorable sites (58). The smooth, grayish bark of the sapling gradually becomes vertically fissured as the tree matures, and turns somewhat brownish. Large cedros have a straight, clean bole, often 15 to 20 in (49 to 66 ft) to the first limb and a narrowly buttressed base. Maximum height is 30 to 40 in (98 to 131 ft) (34). Natural forests containing cedro in Mexico yielded only 2000 m³ (about 71,000 ft³) per year in a total area of 460 000 ha (1,137,000 acres), for an annual yield of 0.004 m³/ha (0.057 ft³/acre). Mahogany yields from the same forest were eight times higher. This illustrates the present low stocking of cedro in natural forests, although the low density may be due in part to past exploitation and lack of regeneration (52,53). In contrast, 40-year-old plantations in Africa yielded 455 m³/ha (6,500 ft³/acre) at the end of the rotation, and a yield of 150 to 270 m³ /ha (about 2,100 to 3,900 ft³/acre) over a 35-year rotation was estimated for line-planted cedro in Surinam (34,58). Webb et al. (61) cited 11 to 22 m³/ha (157 to 314 ft³/acre) per year for managed cedro plantations worldwide. Marshall calculated cedro yield by diameter classes in Trinidad (40); volume tables have been published (9). Rooting Habit- Some confusion exists regarding the rooting habit of saplings and mature cedros. While early workers all reported a very superficial root system, recent literature (34) suggests that the species can become deeply rooted if the soil is loose and coarse or fissured. This is compatible with previously reported observations of vigorous cedro growth on old masonry and in light and well-aerated soils. Seedlings, at any rate, are very superficially rooted and may be sensitive to mechanical damage from weeding and other soil preparation activities (10). Reaction to Competition- Although tolerant of weeds during the seedling stage (63), cedro is classed as intolerant of weeds and shade at the sapling stage and beyond (34). Its thin and spreading crown of light green leaves suggests the habit of a light demanding species as does its potential for fast growth and its appearance after fire (34), in hedgerows (40) and on ruins (48). It is best described as late successional, as it has a moderately long life span. In Trinidad and elsewhere, cedros with more than 100 growth rings are not uncommon (1,40). Attempts to grow Cedrela in plantation systems in Latin America were almost entirely unsuccessful until recently. These early failures (10, 11,17,23,39,40,51) have been attributed to poor choice of experimental sites (too wet, wrong soils), increased risk of insect attack in the dense artificial populations (20), and misunderstanding of light requirements (58). However, a few successes may point to fruitful avenues of further experimentation. Under dry conditions, cedar was successfully grown in plantations in Ecuador with no shade and no apparent Hypsipyla shootborer problems (59). Successful line plantings have been established in Surinam and the taungya system has been used in Mexico (42,58). Damaging Agents- Cedro can tolerate some crown damage by hurricanes and will often resprout. Shade-grown seedlings are sensitive to sunscald after which they become more vulnerable to insect attack. Cedro from tropical provenances is not likely to be frost tolerant. Provenances showing frost resistance grow more slowly than tropical provenances (34,44,57). Plantations of cedro have suffered snail damage in Malaysia and Africa. Slugs killed some nursery stock of an exotic provenance in the Virgin Islands. Beetle damage is a problem in some plantations in Africa, but evidently not in the New World (34,44,62). The most serious insect pest of cedro is the mahogany shootborer Hypsipyla grandella (24). The larvae of this moth eat the pith just behind the growing tip of fast-growing shoots, causing death of the apical meristem. In turn this slows seedling and sapling growth and may ruin tree form, since multiple leaders or bushiness often result. Shootborer attack may also contribute to seedling mortality, especially in already stressed populations (3,20). Although the borer has been studied extensively (21,49,63), an integrated control system has not yet been developed. It has been observed that pest attacks are least frequent in strongly seasonal climates, where the cycle of insect reproduction is naturally broken at least once a year (23,63). Attack is also less frequent in natural forest where host trees are few and widely scattered, so that large pest populations never build up, under shade as contrasted to full sunlight, and in dormant seedlings (20,26,62). Provenance trials of cedars from a wide geographic range have shown that they may vary in response to attack (12) and careful selection may allow future development of tolerant strains. Some progress has been made in chemical and biological control strategies (2,3, 18,19,22) but, regardless of the chemicals used, the target insect may eventually develop resistance to them.",Life History,"Cedro Hembra, Spanish-Ceda",cedrela,ordota,hardwood,10,0
"Cedro wood is still in considerable demand wherever it is available in the American tropics. An attractive, moderately lightweight wood (specific gravity 0.4), its primary use is in household articles used to store clothing. Cedro heartwood contains an aromatic and insect-repelling resin that is the source of its popular name, Spanish-cedar (it resembles the aroma of true cedars (Cedrus spp.). The easily worked wood is both rot-resistant in the ground and highly termite-resistant, making it suitable for exterior construction. Cedro works easily and makes excellent plywood and veneer and would be more widely used if it could be successfully plantation grown (34,35,48,52). Cedro is an important avenue and shade tree in the West Indies and South America, and where imported, in Africa. It has also been used successfully as cacao and coffee shade in Trinidad.",Special Uses,"Cedro Hembra, Spanish-Ceda",cedrela,ordota,hardwood,16,0
"Chestnut oak is a major component in 2 forest cover types and an associated species in 10 others (8). Chestnut Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 44) is found primarily on dry south- and west-facing slopes, ridgetops, and rocky outcrops throughout the Appalachian Mountains at elevations from 450 to 1400 m (1,475 to 4,600 ft). Associated species in this type vary greatly by region, elevation, topographic position, and soils, and include other upland oaks (Quercus spp.) and hickories (Carya spp.); sweet birch (Betula lenta); yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera); blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica); sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua); black cherry (Prunus serotina); black walnut (Juglans nigra); red (Acer rubrum) and sugar (A. saccharum) maples; eastern redcedar (Juniperus uirginiana); eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis); and red (Pinus resinosa), eastern white (P. strobus), pitch (P. rigida), Table Mountain (P. pungens), shortleaf (P. echinata), Virginia (P.virginiana), and longleaf (P. palustris) pines. A variant of this type, chestnut oak-northern red oak, is found in disturbed forests in the Catskills in New York and on Massanutten Mountain in Virginia. The variant chestnut oak-scarlet oak is identified in the central Appalachians, while the variants chestnut oak-pitch pine, chestnut oak-eastern white pine-northern red oak, and chestnut oak-black oak-scarlet oak occur in the southern Appalachians. White Pine-Chestnut Oak (Type 51) is found in the Appalachian region from West Virginia to Georgia. It is most common in southwestern Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and western North Carolina at elevations between 360 and 1100 m (1,200 and 3,600 ft). On the drier sites, common associated species include scarlet (Quercus coccinea), white (Q. alba), post (Q. stellata), and black (Q. velutina) oaks; hickories; blackgum; sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum); red maple; and pitch, Table Mountain, Virginia, and shortleaf pines. On more mesic sites, associated species include northern red (Quercus rubra) and white oaks, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), yellow-poplar, sugar and red maples, and black cherry. Chestnut oak is also an associated species in the following cover types: Eastern White Pine (Type 21); White Pine-Hemlock (Type 22); Red Maple (Type 108); Bear Oak (Type 43); White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52) and its variants white oak-black oak-chestnut oak, black oak-scarlet oak-chestnut oak, and scarlet oak-chestnut oak; White Oak (Type 53); Black Oak (Type 110); Pitch Pine (Type 45) and its variant pitch pine-chestnut oak; Virginia Pine (Type 79); and Virginia Pine-Oak (Type 78). Common shrub associates of chestnut oak include highbush and lowbush blueberry (Vaccinum corymbosum and V. angustifolium), dwarf chinkapin oak Quercus prinoides), and mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Before the demise of American chestnut (Castanea dentata), chestnut oak was an important component of the Appalachian oak-chestnut forests. Since then, hickory, chestnut oak, northern red oak, and white oak have replaced American chestnut as these stands have gradually changed to oak-hickory stands (20).",Associated Forest Cover,Chestnut Oak,quercus,prinus,hardwood,1,0
"The climate throughout most of the range of chestnut oak is humid, with small superhumid areas in the Appalachian Mountains. The average annual precipitation varies from 810 mm (32 in) in western New York and southern Ontario to more than 2030 mm (80 in) in the southern Appalachians; however, annual precipitation for the majority of the chestnut oak range is between 1020 and 1220 mm (40 and 48 in).

"Flowering and Fruiting- Chestnut oak is monoecious; the flowers develop in the spring at the time of bud-break and leaf development. The staminate flowers are borne on aments (catkins) that originate from buds in the terminal bud cluster of the previous year's shoots. Development of the aments begins with the first expansion of these buds, when minimum air temperatures remain above 10° C (50° F) for more than 10 days. Pistillate flowers develop on short stalks in the axils of the new leaves from 5 to 10 days after the aments emerge. Pollination is by wind; pollen dispersal occurs 10 to 20 days after the aments emerge and is controlled largely by weather. Above-normal temperatures in late April followed by 13 to 20 days of below-normal temperatures in early May enhance successful pollination and the development of large acorn crops. The early warm period promotes the development of the aments, shoot expansion, and pistillate flower development, and the later cool period delays pollen dispersal to better coincide with pistillate flower maturation. Uniformly increasing temperatures during this period usually result in poor pollination and small acorn crops (27,28). Chestnut oak produces an abundant crop of aments every year, but the production of pistillate flowers varies considerably from year to year; trees that produce a large crop of flowers and acorns one year usually produce fewer flowers the following year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Chestnut oak acorns mature in one growing season and drop from early September to early October, 2 to 5 weeks before the acorns of other upland oaks. Production of chestnut oak acorns is erratic, and heavy crops occur only once every 4 or 5 years. In general, chestnut oak produces fewer acorns than other upland oaks, although occasional trees can be prolific seed producers (2). Chestnut oak begins producing seed at about age 20, but stump sprouts as young as 3 years can produce viable seed, and coppice stands as young as 7 or 8 years can have abundant acorn production. The germinative capacity of sound acorns is around 90 percent. Dissemination is primarily by gravity and squirrels (4,22,26). Seedling Development- Chestnut oak acorns have no dormancy and therefore germinate in the fall. Germination is hypogeal (22). If temperatures are below 16° C (61° F), however, shoot (but not root) development is inhibited by an induced epicotyl dormancy. This dormancy is broken by chilling during the winter, and normal shoot development resumes in the spring (9). Some acorns germinate at day/night temperatures of 100/20 C (500/350 F), but most germinate at temperatures at or above 180/10° C or 65°/50° F). Chestnut oak acorns are much more capable of germinating in dry soil than acorns of white, black, or northern red oak. This difference may be due to a thick parenchyma layer in the acorn pericarp that allows them to absorb and retain more moisture than acorns of other oaks (17). Germination of chestnut oak acorns is enhanced by a covering of leaf litter 2 or 3 cm (I in) deep, but a covering of more than about 5 cm (2 in) results in many etiolated seedlings. Large numbers of seedlings can become established after good seed years, but such years occur infrequently. Seedling establishment and survival are greatly reduced by dense herbaceous and shrub layers. Chestnut oak seedlings grow slowly. In Indiana, the height of seedlings 10 years after establishment averaged 15 cm (6 in) in an uncut forest, 24 cm (9 in) where release cuttings were made, and 146 cm (58 in) in a clearcut. In contrast to this slow seedling growth, chestnut oak sprouts in the clearcut were more than 6.4 m (21 ft) tall (4). The seedlings are capable of rapid growth, however, when growing conditions are near optimal. In one nursery study, chestnut oak seedlings produced an average of 4.3 growth flushes during the first growing season and exceeded bear oak and white oak, and equaled or exceeded northern red oak in height, dry weight, and leaf area. Growth of these seedlings was highly correlated with initial leaf area, which in turn was correlated with acorn size (11). Vegetative Reproduction- When tops die back or are damaged, chestnut oak seedlings and advance reproduction sprout vigorously from dormant buds at the root collar or on the stem. For stems of advanced reproduction that have been cut, the number of sprouts per plant and the growth of the sprouts increase with increasing size of the original stem and root system (25). Stumps of cut trees up to 60 years of age sprout vigorously, but the percent of stumps that sprout declines with increasing size for trees more than 46 cm (18 in) in d.b.h. Incidence of decay is low for stump sprouts that originate within 5 cm (2 in) of the ground and such sprouts can develop into high-quality trees. Sprouting frequency and vigor are greater from stumps of trees cut during the dormant season than from those cut during the growing season (24,35). It has been estimated that 75 percent of the chestnut oak reproduction in the southern Appalachians is of sprout origin (4).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Chestnut Oak,quercus,prinus,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Chestnut oak is a mediumsize tree; at maturity it usually attains a height of 20 to 24 m (65 to 80 ft) and a d.b.h. of 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 in) depending on site quality. Maximum dimensions are approximately 30 m (100 ft) in height and 183 cm (72 in) in d.b.h. (4). In mixed oak stands, the height growth of adjacent dominant and codominant chestnut, scarlet, northern red, and black oaks is about equal and is greater than that of white oaks (7,33). White, chestnut, black, and scarlet oaks of equal site index (height at base age 50 years) have similar height growth patterns up to about age 60. Beyond this age, white oak maintains a better height growth rate than the other three species and, at site indexes below about 18.3 in (60 ft) chestnut oak maintains a height growth intermediate between that of white oak and the black and scarlet oaks (5). On comparable sites in West Virginia, diameter growth of chestnut oak is generally greater than that of white oak, the same as that of scarlet oak, hickory, and beech (Fagus grandifolia), but less than that of northern red and black oaks, yellow-poplar, sugar maple, basswood (Tilia americana), black cherry, and white ash (Fraxinus americana) (30,31). Sawtimber yield from chestnut oak stands on dry slopes and ridges in the southern Appalachians is about 98.0 m³/ha (7,000 fbm/acre) at age 80. On average sites, maximum periodic growth is about 1.4 m³/ha (100 fbm/acre) per year at age 100 (4). On the better sites, chestnut oak has good form and maintains a bole that is relatively clear of branches and sprouts, although many epicormic sprouts develop if the bole is exposed to sunlight (32). Rooting Habit- Chestnut oak seedlings initially develop a deep tap root but later lose this configuration. Saplings and larger trees have a root system consisting of 6 to 10 main lateral roots extending 3 to 10 m (10 to 33 ft) from the root crown at depths from near the soil surface to 91 cm (36 in). Numerous secondary roots branch off these main laterals, and a dense mat of fine roots develops near the soil surface. The root system extends over an area approximately five times that of the crown area. The roots of chestnut oak are slightly deeper than those of northern red oak but not as deep as those of white oak (29). Chestnut oak seedlings maintain much higher root starch levels during the growing season than white oak or northern red oak and have a higher root-to-shoot ratio and a more rapid initial root development rate than northern red oak. These factors may partially account for the species adaptability to xeric sites (10,16). Reaction to Competition- Chestnut oak is intermediate in shade tolerance. Among the oaks, it is similar in tolerance to white oak, but more tolerant than northern red, black, or scarlet oak. In closed stands in the Appalachian region, most chestnut oak reproduction lives only a few years. In partial shade, however, seedling sprout advance reproduction may persist for many years. These stems grow slowly and die back and resprout periodically but are capable of rapid growth if released. In the Appalachian region, chestnut oak typically occupies intermediate to poor sites where it is considered to be the physiographic climax. It is excluded from the more mesic sites by species that grow more rapidly in the seedling and sapling stages, such as northern red, black, and white oaks; yellow-poplar; sugar and red maples; and black cherry. The most xeric sites are typically occupied by species even better adapted to such conditions, such as scarlet oak, post oak, and pitch pine (8,21,23). Damaging Agents- Because of its predominance on steep slopes and dry sites, chestnut oak has a higher incidence of fire damage and associated decay than other oaks throughout the Appalachians, although its inherent resistance to heartwood decay is greater than that of white, northern red, black, or scarlet oak. Chestnut oak is susceptible to most of the diseases of oaks including oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum). It is particularly susceptible to the twig-blight fungus Diplodia longispora, a die-back and branch canker caused by Botryodiplodia spp., and, from Virginia northward, stem cankers caused by Nectria galligena and Strumella coryneoidea. The heartrot fungi Spongipellis pachyodon commonly occurs around dead branch stubs on chestnut oak in the southeast. Sprout rot, caused primarily by the heart rot fungi Stereum gausapatum, Fistulina hepatica, and Armillaria mellea, is common in chestnut oak stump sprouts that originate 5 cm (2 in) or more above the ground line, although the incidence of this rot is less in chestnut oak than in other oaks. The more important decay-causing fungi of chestnut oak in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois are Inonotus andersonii, Stereum gausapatum, Spongipellis pachyodon, Wolfiporia cocos, Inonotus dryophilus, Xylobolus frustulatus, Perenniporia compacta, and Armillaria mellea (3,13). Chestnut oak and white oak are the two species most preferred by the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). Other important defoliators of chestnut oak are the spring and fall cankerworms (Paleacrita Vernata and Alsophila pometaria), the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and the half-wing geometer (Phigalia titea) (1,14,34). Chestnut oak is more resistant to wood borers than most oaks but is particularly susceptible to attack by ambrosia beetles, especially the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus) and several species of the genera Platypus and Xyleborus; these beetles are particularly damaging to trees that have been weakened by fire or drought. The more important wood borers that attack chestnut oak are the oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus), the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), and the little carpenterworm (P. macmurtrei). Chestnut oaks are also susceptible to several gallforming wasps (Cynipidae), a pit scale (Asterolecanium quercicola), and the golden oak scale (A. variolosum). These insects may kill twigs and branches but rarely kill mature trees. The acorns of chestnut oak are frequently infested with larvae of the nut weevils Curculio spp. and Conotrachelus spp., the moth Valentinia glandulella, and the cynipid gall wasps (Cynipidae). However, one study indicated that chestnut oak acorns may have lower insect infestation rates than acorns of other oaks (2).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Chestnut Oak,quercus,prinus,hardwood,14,0
"Chestnut oak is most commonly found on dry upland sites such as ridgetops and upper slopes with shallow soils, south- and west-facing upper slopes, and sandy or rocky soils with low moisture-holding capacity of the orders Ultisols and Inceptisols. Chestnut oak grows from near sea level on the Coastal Plain of New Jersey and Long Island to elevations of approximately 1400 in (4,600 ft) in the southern Appalachians (4,8). In the Blue Ridge Mountains of northern Georgia, site index for chestnut oak ranges from 12 to 25 in (39 to 83 ft), and averages about 20 in (65 ft). Site index is greater on steep slopes, lower slope positions, and at elevations below 800 in (2,600 ft) than elsewhere. Other indicators of good chestnut oak sites are subsoils with more than 15 percent silt, loam or sandy loam surface soils, and sites where litter decomposes rapidly (15). Chestnut oak growth is poorest on soils of the Porters (Humic Hapludult) and Ashe (Typic Dystrochrept) series, intermediate on soils of the Hayesville and Halewood series (Typic Hapludults), and best on soils of the Tusquitee and Brevard series (Humic and Typic Hapludults, respectively) (6).",Soils and Topography,Chestnut Oak,quercus,prinus,hardwood,15,0

"Chinkapin oak is rarely a predominant tree, but it grows in association with many other species. It is a component of the forest cover type White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 52) and the Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40) (2). It grows in association with white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Q. uelutina), northern red oak (Q. rubra), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (A. rubrum), hickories (Carya spp.), black cherry (Prunus serotina), cucumbertree (Magnolia acuminata), white ash (Fraxinus americana), American basswood (Tilia americana), black walnut (Juglans nigra), butternut (J. cinerea), and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). American beech (Fagus grandifolia), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), pitch pine (P. rigida), Virginia pine (P. uirginiana), Ozark chinkapin (Castanea ozarkensis), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), southern red oak (Q. falcata), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and winged elm (Ulmus alata) also grow in association with chinkapin oak. In the Missouri Ozarks a redcedar-chinkapin oak association has been described. The most common small tree and shrub species found in association with chinkapin oak include flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), sourwood (Oxydendron arboreum), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), Vaccinium spp., Viburnum spp., hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), and sumacs (Rhus spp.).

"The climate in which chinkapin oak grows is humid except for the southwestern fringe of its natural range, which is moist subhumid to dry subhumid. The average length of frost-free periods ranges from 120 days in Vermont to 240 days in Texas. Precipitation in the growing season (April 1 to September 30) ranges from an average of about 250 mm (10 in) in southwest Texas to about 2030 mm (80 in) in the southern Appalachians. In southern Indiana and southern Ohio where chinkapin oak grows best, growing season precipitation is from 510 to 640 mm (20 to 25 in) (4).",Climate,Chinkapin Oak,quercus,muehlenbergii,hardwood,2,0
"Chinkapin oak intergrades with dwarf chinkapin oak (Quercus prinoides) and both have been recognized as varieties of the same species by some authors. Dwarf chinkapin oak, however, is commonly a low-growing, clump-forming shrub, rarely treelike, and is a separate distinct species. Two recognized, named hybrids of chinkapin oak are Q. x introgressa P M. Thomson (Q. muehlenbergii x Q. bicolor x prinoides), and Q. x deamii Trel. (Q. muehlenbergii x macrocarpa). Chinkapin oak is also known to hybridize with white oak (Q. alba); Gambel oak Q. gambelii); and dwarf chinkapin oak (Q. prinoides) (6).",Genetics,Chinkapin Oak,quercus,muehlenbergii,hardwood,7,0
"Chinkapin oak is found in western Vermont and New York, west to southern Ontario, southern Michigan, southern Wisconsin, extreme southeastern Minnesota, and Iowa; south to southeastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas, western Oklahoma, and central Texas; east to northwest Florida; and north mostly in the mountains to Pennsylvania and southwestern Massachusetts. There are local populations in the mountains of southeastern New Mexico, Trans-Pecos Texas, and northeastern Mexico (5). -The native range of chinkapin oak.",Native Range,Chinkapin Oak,quercus,muehlenbergii,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Chinkapin oak is monoecious in flowering habit; flowers emerge in April to late May or early June. The staminate flowers are borne in catkins that develop from the leaf axils of the previous year, and the pistillate flowers develop from the axils of the current year's leaves. The fruit, an acorn or nut, is borne singly or in pairs, matures in 1 year, and ripens in September or October. About half of the acorn is enclosed in a thin cup and is chestnut brown to nearly black (8). Seed Production and Dissemination- Because chinkapin oak is not common, its seed production characteristics have not been studied. Observations in the Central States indicate, however, that good seed crops occur at infrequent intervals. Chinkapin oak acorns are disseminated in the same manner as those of other oaks-by gravity and rodents (4). Seedling Development- Studies of oak regeneration in the Central States indicate chinkapin oak seedlings are established and grow much as do other upland oaks (4,7). Germination is hypogeal (8). Chinkapin oak acorns germinate in the fall soon after falling, and growth of the radicle continues until stopped by cold temperatures. Growth is resumed when the soil warms enough in the spring, at which time the epicotyl emerges. A light to moderate litter cover does not hinder germination and seedling establishment. Chinkapin oak seedlings tolerate moderate overstory or understory cover but growth is slow. When an old stand is harvested, the species must be present as large advance reproduction if it is to be a component of the new stand. Vegetative Reproduction- Chinkapin oak sprouts readily and like other oaks the tops of advance reproduction generally are younger than the roots. Stumps of cut trees also sprout but no relation between sprouting frequency and stump size or age has been determined (7). Rooting of stem cuttings and budding techniques have not been successful in propagating chinkapin oak, but some success has been attained with grafting (4).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Chinkapin Oak,quercus,muehlenbergii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Chinkapin oak attains a height of from 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) and a d.b.h. of from 61 to 91 em (24 to 36 in) at maturity. In forest stands it develops a straight columnar bole with a dense rounded crown and fairly small branches; in the open it develops a short bole with a broad spreading crown. Because chinkapin oak is usually found as scattered individuals, its growth characteristics have not been extensively studied. Observations from studies in the Central States, particularly southern Indiana, indicate its growth is similar to that of white oak on similar sites (4). It should respond well to release and there is no reason to discriminate against it in thinnings. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Chinkapin oak is classed as intolerant of shade. It withstands moderate shading when young but becomes more intolerant of shade with age. It is regarded as a climax species on dry, droughty soils, especially those of limestone origin. On more moist sites it is subclimax to climax. It is often found as a component of the climax vegetation in stands on mesic sites with limestone soils. However, many oak-hickory stands on moist sites that contain chinkapin oak are succeeded by the climax beech, maple, and ash (1,4). Damaging Agents- Severe wildfire kills saplings and small pole-size trees but these resprout. Fire scars serve as entry points for decay-causing fungi, however, and the resulting decay can cause serious losses. Oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum), a vascular disease, attacks chinkapin oak and usually kills the tree within 2 to 4 years. Other diseases that attack chinkapin oak include the cankers Strumella coryneoidea and Nectria galligena, shoestring root rot (Armillarea mellea), anthracnose (Gnomonia veneta), and leaf blister (Taphrina spp.) (4). The most serious defoliating insects that attack chinkapin oak are the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), and the variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo). Insects that bore into the bole and seriously degrade the products cut from infested trees include the carpenterworm. (Prionoyxstus robiniae), little carpenterworm (P. macmurtrei), white oak borer (Goes tigrinus), Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus), oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus), and twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus). The acorn weevils (Curculio spp.), larvae of moths (Valentinia glandulella and Melissopus latiferreanus), and gallforming cynipids (Callirhytis spp.) attack and destroy the acorns (4).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Chinkapin Oak,quercus,muehlenbergii,hardwood,14,0
"Chinkapin oak is usually found on warm, moist Udalf Alfisols, Dystrochrept Inceptisols, Udoll Mollisols, and Udult Ultisols over much of its range. In the extreme southwestern part of the range chinkapin oak also grows on warm, dry Ustoll Mollisols and Astalf Alfisols (9). Chinkapin oak is generally found on well-drained upland soils derived from limestone or where limestone outcrops occur. Occasionally it is found on well-drained limestone soils along streams. It appears that soil pH is strongly related to the prescence of chinkapin oak, which is generally found on soils that are weakly acid (pH about 6.5) to alkaline (above pH 7.0). It grows on both northerly and southerly aspects but is more common on the warmer southerly aspects. It is absent or rare at high elevations in the Appalachians (3,4).",Soils and Topography,Chinkapin Oak,quercus,muehlenbergii,hardwood,15,0
"Chinkapin oak acorns are sweet and palatable and are eaten by squirrels, mice, voles, chipmunks, deer, turkey, and other birds. Acorns may be taken from the tree or from the ground.

"Common persimmon is a key species in the forest cover type Sassafras-Persimmon (Society of American Foresters Type 64) (3) and is an associated species in the following cover types: Southern Scrub Oak (Type 72), Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80), Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82), Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Type 92), Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93), Overcup Oak-Water Hickory (Type 96), Baldcypress (Type 101), and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102).

"Common persimmon is found from southern Connecticut and Long Island to southern Florida; westward through central Pennsylvania, southern Ohio, southern Indiana, and central Illinois to southeast Iowa; and south through eastern Kansas and Oklahoma to the Valley of the Colorado River in Texas. It does not grow, however, in the main range of the Appalachian Mountains, nor in much of the oak-hickory forest type on the Allegheny Plateau. Its best development is in the rich bottom lands of the Mississippi River and its tributaries and in coastal river valleys (9). It is exceedingly common in the South Atlantic and Gulf States, often covering abandoned fields with a shrubby growth, and springing up by the sides of roads and fences. It is often the first tree species to start growth on abandoned and denuded cropland. It is well adapted to an environment of high insolation and low water supply. -The native range of common perssimon.",Native Range,Common Persimmon,diospyros,virginiana,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering, Seed Production, and Dissemination- The inconspicuous flowers bloom from March to June within its botanical range and from April through May in areas where it grows best. Staminate flowers are in two- or three-flowered cymes, tubular, 8 to 13 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long, and greenish yellow. Pistillate flowers are solitary, sessile or shortpeduncled, about 1.9 cm (0.75 in) long. The corolla is fragrant with 4 or 5 greenish yellow, thick recurved lobes. Common persimmon is dioecious; the staminate and pistillate flowers are borne on separate trees on shoots of the current year, when the leaves are more than half grown. The fruit is a persistent spherical berry 1.9 to 5.1 cm (0.8 to 2.0 in) in diameter. It ripens from September to November or occasionally a little earlier. When mature it is yellow to orange or dark red in color, often with a glaucous bloom. Each berry usually contains one to eight flat, brown seeds about 13 mm (0.5 in) long but is sometimes seedless. Fruits fall from September to late winter. The optimum fruit-bearing age is 25 to 50 years, but 10-year-old trees sometimes bear fruit. Good crops are borne about every 2 years under normal conditions. About 45 kg (100 lb) of fruit yields 4.5 to 13.6 kg (10 to 30 lb) of clean seed, with an average of 2,640 seeds per kg (1,200 seeds per lb). The seed is disseminated by birds and animals that feed on the fruits, and, to some extent, by overflow water in low bottom lands (9). The seeds remain dormant during winter and germinate in April or May, after about a month of soil temperatures above 15° C (60° F). Persimmon is easily raised from seed, and if planting is to be done with seeds, they should be cleaned and spread out for drying for a day or two and then stratified under moist conditions for 2 to 3 months at 1° to 4° C (33° to 40° F). They should be soaked 2 to 3 days before planting. Seeds lose their viability through extremes of heat, cold, or drying. They should be planted in spring or fall in shallow drills in light soils with plenty of humus and covered to a depth of about 13 min (0.5 in). No insects or animals are known to damage flowers or fruit seriously. Late freeze can damage the flowers and cause premature fruit drop. Seedling Development- Persimmon is very tolerant, and natural reproduction can normally be expected in the forest understory. It is often prolific in openings. Germination is epigeal. The seedlings develop a strong taproot and after their first year are about 20 cm (8 in) tall or even taller on good sites. Prolonged flooding or submergence during the growing season will kill young trees; however, seedlings usually survive under very adverse conditions. Vegetative Reproduction- Persimmon may be propagated by root cuttings and grafting (10). Root cuttings 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) long and 8 mm (0.3 in) in diameter can be used provided the ends are sealed with pitch or wax to prevent rot. Older twigs may be used similarly. They can be buried in sand until ready to plant (15). Trees may be grafted by chip budding, cleft grafting, or whip grafting. Nursery stock should be set about 15 cm (6 in) apart and root pruned each year. Stock 1 to 2 years old may be transplanted, but this should be done in moist deep soil because of the deep root system (15). Stumps sprout readily and thickets of shrubby persimmon develop from root suckers. Sprouting from the root collar after fires is common. Seedlings or suckers are difficult to transplant.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Common Persimmon,diospyros,virginiana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The growth rate of persimmon is generally slow (9). On dry, old-field sites it frequently makes only a shrubby growth 4.6 to 6.1 m (15 to 20 ft) tall. On poor sites the larger trees contain a high percentage of heartwood that cannot be used for lumber because it checks excessively during seasoning. Approximately 50 percent of the total radial growth is complete in 70 to 90 days, and 90 percent complete in 100 to 109 days after growth starts in the spring (6). Persimmon responds well to fertilizer. The species normally attains a height of 9 to 18 m (30 to 60 ft) at maturity but in optimum habitats may reach a height of 21 to 24 rn (70 to 80 ft) and a diameter of 51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 in). It usually forms an upright or drooping type tree with a rounded or conical crown. Stems may be clumped, either because seedlings develop in close proximity to one another or because they arise from suckers after a tree has been cut down. The leaves are deciduous, simple, alternate, and entire. The bark is brown to black, fissures are deep, and ridges are broken into rectangular checkered sections. Per acre volume figures for this species are not available because it usually grows as scattered individuals. Tops of orchard grown trees should be thinned to allow for better fruit production. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Persimmon is classed as very tolerant of shade. It can persist in the understory for many years (9). Its response to release is not definitely known but is probably not especially good. Persimmon competes with almost any plant under harsh growing conditions. Damaging Agents- A number of insects attack persimmon but normally do no serious harm (9). A bark and phloem borer (Agrilus fuscipennis) infests living persimmon and the persimmon borer (Sannina uroceriformis) tunnels in the stems and taproots of young trees and damages nursery stock. Caterpillars may defoliate the trees in early summer and into mid summer. The principal defoliators are a webworm (Seiarctica echo) and the hickory horned devil (Citheronia regalis). Unless sprayed, they may defoliate and severely damage a young plant. No serious damage to the merchantable part of living trees is recorded. The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) retards growth by cutting off smaller branches. The wood of dying and dead trees is often riddled by the false powderpost beetle (Xylobiops basilaris). Cephalosporium diospyri causes persimmon wilt, a fungus disease that kills many trees in central Tennessee and the Southeastern States (1). The disease is characterized by a sudden wilting of the leaves, followed by defoliation and death of the branches from the top down. An infected tree often lives 1 or 2 years after this symptom appears. Diseased trees should be burned, and cuts and bruises on other trees should be painted to prevent entry by wind-borne spores. No disease-resistant trees have been found. A wound is necessary for primary infection. The hickory twig girdler and powderpost beetle cause the majority of wounds in healthy trees. As soon as the tree dies, the fungus produces spores in large quantities between the bark and the wood near the base of the tree. Because common persimmon is often considered noxious in pastures and fields, much effort has been expended in its control and eradication (2). It is easily defoliated with 2,4,5-T at 1.1 kg/ha (1 lb/acre) or less but sprouts readily from both stem and roots after treatment. Treatment is most effective in May when leaves are fully expanded. Additives (Ethephon, MAA, and TIBA) increase both the defoliation and kill of persimmon. Surfactants increase effectiveness of 2,4,5-T. Picloram in combination with 2,4,5-T, and dicamba, alone and in combination with 2,4,5-T, has also given good control. Soil application of picloram and dicamba at 6.7 kg/ha (6 lb/acre) gave kills of 75 and 70 percent, respectively. Complete top kill was possible by injecting undiluted solutions of dicamba or mixtures of 2,4,5-T and dicamba. Tordon 101 or Esteron 99 at 7.6 liters (2 gal) plus triclopyr at 9.4 liters/ha (1 gal/acre) and Tordon at 37 liters/ha (4 gal/acre) gave 100 percent control of persimmon (4). Undiluted 2,4-D dimethylamine killed persimmon when applied in 1- or 2-ml (0.03- or 0.07-oz) dosages in injections placed edge-to-edge up to 23 cm (9 in) apart around the stem (11). A 4-to-1 mixture of triisoproponolamine salts of 2,4-D plus picloram was also effective.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Common Persimmon,diospyros,virginiana,hardwood,14,0
"Common persimmon grows in a tremendous range of conditions from very dry, sterile, sandy woodlands to river bottoms to rocky hillsides and moist or very dry locations.

"The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and very close grained. The average number of rings is 5.5 per cm (14 per in) (12). Specific gravity of light-brown sapwood is 0.79; a 0.028 m³ (1.0 ft³ ) block weighs about 22 kg (49 lb). Because of its hardness, smoothness, and even texture, it is particularly desirable for turnery, plane stocks, shoe lasts, shuttles, and golf club heads. Persimmon is sometimes planted for its edible fruit. Dried fruit is added to baked goods and occasionally is fermented with hops, cornmeal, or wheat bran into a sort of beer. The dried, roasted, ground seeds have been used as a substitute for coffee. Several cultivars are available with improved fruit size and quality. In native persimmon areas, top working or grafting on suckers is a good way to get superior cultivars into bearing quickly. One staminate tree seems sufficient to pollinate at least 23 pistillate trees of the same race (8). The pulp is very astringent when not ripe, but after a frost in the fall, when the fruit turns yellow orange, the flesh is pleasing in taste (12). The fruit is eaten by many species of song birds, also by the skunk, raccoon, opossum, gray and fox squirrels, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, bobwhite, crows, rabbits, hogs, and cattle (5). It may, however, cause sickness in livestock. Deer browse readily on persimmon sprouts, but cattle graze them only lightly. Seeds and fruits are generally low in crude protein, crude fat, and calcium but high in nitrogen-free extract and tannin (13). The inner bark and unripe fruit are sometimes used in treatment of fevers, diarrhea, and hemorrhage. Indelible ink is made from fruit. Persimmon is valued as an ornamental because of its hardiness, adaptability to a wide range of soils and climates, its lustrous leaves, its abundant crop of fruits, and its immunity from disease and insects. It has been introduced into Europe. The tree is suitable for erosion control on deeper soils because of its deep root system, but this same characteristic makes it difficult to plant. Persimmon is considered a woody weed in unimproved pastures, and it prevents many areas from being grazed effectively. Inoculation of persimmon stumps with a fungus (Cephalosporium diospyri) was found to be an effective means of preventing subsequent sprouting. Persimmon flowers are useful in the production of honey.",Special Uses,Common Persimmon,diospyros,virginiana,hardwood,16,0
"Cucumbertree is found scattered in the oak-hickory forest. It is an associated species in six eastern intermediate to climax forest cover types (5).

In the Appalachian and Cumberland Mountains, cucumbertree commonly occurs with yellow-poplar, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), white ash, basswood, birches, sugar maple, northern red oak, black oak, and white oak. Common understory vegetation includes hemlock, sugar maple, beech, birch, rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.), viburnums, wild hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens), and several ferns (Dyopteris spp.).

Understory vegetation includes maples, oaks, hickory, black cherry, grape, spicebush (Lindera benzoin), wild hydrangea, viburnum, dogwood, and ferns. At its southern limits in the Coastal Plains from Louisiana to west Florida, cucumbertree is associated with Sweetbay (Magnolia uirginiana), bigleaf magnolia (M. macrophylla), and southern magnolia (M. grandiflora) in addition to white oak, water oak (Quercus nigra), swamp chestnut oak Q. michauxii), and southern red oak (Q. falcata), elms, hickories, yellow-poplar, beech, maples, white ash, and blackgum.",Associated Forest Cover,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,1,0
"Cucumbertree is the hardiest of the native tree-size magnolias. The climate is described as humid to subhumid throughout its range. There are 110 to 260 days in the growing season, with 150 to 160 frost-free days in the northern portion of the range and 180 to 230 frost-free days in the southern portion. Annual precipitation measures 890 to 2030 min (35 to 80 in), of which about 510 to 1020 mm. (20 to 40 in) fall during the growing season. The mean annual temperature varies from a low of 7° C (45° F) in the northern range to 18° C (65° F) in the south. January temperatures usually are between -7° to 10° C (20° to 50° F); July temperatures are between 18° to 27° C (65° to 80° F); however, sometimes there are extremes well above and well below these temperatures for relatively short periods of time. Average annual snowfall measures from 200 cm (80 in) or more in the north to only a trace of snow in the south (25,29).",Climate,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,2,0
"Most of the variability of the species is in the southern part of its range (17). Geographic varieties of cucumbertree include Magnolia acuminata var. cordata in the Piedmont; var. ozarkensis in the Ouachita and Ozark Mountains; var. acuminata over the range except for the Piedmont; M. acuminata forma aurea in the mountains and upper Piedmont of North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee; and M. acuminata var. alabamensis and M. acuminata var. subcordata in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain (6,20,21). Cucumbertree is used successfully as root stocks, for chip-budding, and in other grafting methods with Magnolia macrophylla. Factors complicate hybridization possibilities. This species is the latest of the subgenus Yulania to open its flower in the spring. Some successful hybrids include ""Woodsman"" (M. acuminata x liliflora) called Magnolia x brooklynensis. There have been successful crosses of Magnolia acuminata with M. x brooklynensis and M. x soulangiana. A hybrid has been developed from M. acuminata x sprengeri. If the possibility of a spring frost is great, newly developed hybrids may not flower (13,15,16,20,21). Natural crosses of M. acuminata and M. denudata seldom occur (19). Artificial hybrids with other species are possible in the subgenus Yulania. Several successful additional combinations of hybrid crosses have been noted (23).",Hybrids,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,9,0
"Cucumbertree is widely distributed but never abundant.

"The magnolia genus is one of the most ancient among flowering trees. Though subgenera may be intergrafted, pollinations across subgenetic divisions have yielded only apomicts of the female parent (13).

"Flowering and Fruiting- Cucumbertree flowers from early April through early July depending on location (22). Self-pollination usually does not occur because the flowers do not produce ripe pollen until the female stigma is no longer receptive (12). Magnolia flowers are perfect and are borne singly at the ends of the branches. They appear after the leaves start developing. The flowers close at night and do not last longer than 2 to 4 days. Pollination is largely by insects. The fruit, a green cucumber-shaped cone, ripens in late August or September. The thickened, rounded, red knobby follicles open exposing reddish-orange seeds that hang on slender threads before falling to the ground (7). The outer seedcoat is fleshy, oily, and soft; the inner seedcoat is hard, thin, and membranous enclosing a large and fleshy endosperm. Weather adversely influences the sensitive flower receptivity and available pollen. Also, cucumbertrees have a shorter period of receptivity and pollen shedding than other native magnolias (14). Seed Production and Dissemination- Cucumbertree produces from 10 to 60 seeds per fruit. Good seed crops usually occur every 4 to 5 years, but less frequently at the margins of the geographic range. Light seed crops occur in intervening years. Seed bearing begins at about 30 years and is optimum at age 50 and beyond (18). The average number of uncleaned seeds per kilogram is about 3,530 (1,600/lb); for depulped, cleaned seed, the average ranges from about 6,400 to 14,600/kg (2,900 to 6,600/lb) (7,18). Seeds are usually disseminated by birds, wind, water, and gravity soon after ripening in the fall. Seedling Development- Magnolia seed of all species seems more sensitive to adverse temperatures and moisture factors than other tree seed (7). All seeds of magnolia species lose viability if fully dried or stored over winters at room temperatures. During germination, the cotyledons (epigeous) emerge from the ground. Germination occurs the first or second spring following seed production. Seed dormancy can be overcome by several months of low temperature. Normally, it is essential to stratify the seed for first-year germination. Moist, cold storage is recommended (14). Average seed germination is 55 percent; seeds germinate in 35 to 60 days. The clean or uncleaned seed can be stored at 0° to 5° C (32° to 41° F) in sealed containers for several years with little loss of viability. Reproduction of cucumbertree in the forests is scarce because of the destruction of seeds by birds and rodents, high susceptibility of the seedlings to freezing, and the exacting conditions required for germination (18). Nursery practices used to artificially propagate magnolia seed include sowing the seed in the fall or stratifying the seed several months and then sowing the seed in the late winter or spring. The beds should be mulched and the mulch not removed until there is no possibility of a late spring frost. Young seedlings need half shade during most of the first summer in the seedbed. Normally plantings are done with 1-0 bare root seedlings (18). Cucumbertree is easy to transplant (30). Vegetative Reproduction- Cucumbertree sprouts readily and often is used as grafting root stock for named varieties and ornamental species. Propagation is from seed or grafts; use of cuttings is unsuccessful (15). Successful grafting allows this species to be grown far north of its natural range (17).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Cucumbertree can reach a height of about 30 m (100 ft) and a d.b.h. of 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in). Typically, this tree is 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) tall and 60 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. Cucumbertree grows fast in moist, deep soils of coves and lower slopes. This species matures in 100 years and seldom lives more than 150 years (8). Generally, the species is rapid growing and short lived. There are no available published data on the growth rate and yield of individual trees. Rooting Habit- The root system for cucumbertree is deep and widespread, and trees rarely develop a taproot (30). Cucumbertree is susceptible to windthrow, especially on steep slopes. Reaction to Competition- This species is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance (24). Observations on the Fernow Experimental Forest, Parsons, WV, indicate that cucumbertree regeneration is more frequent in clearcuts than in partial cuts. In early development of central Appalachian hardwood stands, cucumbertree competes favorably with yellow-poplar and black cherry on good oak sites and with oak species on fair sites. Cucumbertree is similar to yellow-poplar in that it usually develops a straight bole at a young age. Cucumbertree produces considerable branches, but since it self-prunes well in closed stands, it is usually clear boled (8). Damaging Agents- Cucumbertree has no important disease agents; however, it is very sensitive to ground fires and frost (8). Nectria galligena is common on cucumbertree stands on unsuitable sites, particularly in the southern Appalachian region. Nectria cankers cause defects but seldom kill the tree. Ambrosia beetles such as Platypus compositus, a common wood borer, seriously degrade recently felled trees during warm months. In the South, it is common to saw logs within 2 to 3 weeks after felling (2). The magnolia scale (Neolecanium cornuparuum), one of the largest scale insects in the United States, can seriously injure magnolia species. Other sap-sucking insects that attack cucumbertree are the European fruit lecanium (Parthenolecanium corni); the oleander pit scale (Asterolecanium pustulans); and the San Jose scale (Quadraspidiotus perniciosus). Common insect defoliators of cucumbertree are 0dontopus calceatus, Phyllocnistis magnoliella, and Phyllophaga forsteri (2). Sapsucker damage is common on cucumbertree. Bird peck causes stain streaks in the wood several feet above and below each peck, resulting in lumber degrade.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,14,0
"This species prefers rich soils of bottomland and north to east slopes and is most plentiful in mountains and hills. The soils must be well drained, moist, and deep. Most slopes where this species is found are gentle to moderate, up to 25 percent, though cucumber tree is also found on steeper slopes. The species is found at elevations as high as 1524 in (5,000 ft) above sea level. Cucumbertree is found in three orders and five suborders of soil (28). The dominant order, Inceptisols, occurs on approximately 60 percent of the species range, particularly in the Appalachians. On steep slopes greater than 25 percent, cucumbertree grows on coarse loams. On gentle to moderate slopes it is found on fine loams. Here, water is readily available to plants during more than one-half of the year or more than three consecutive months during the growing season. Soil textures are finer than loamy sand and these soils have a moderate to high nutrient content. Approximately 35 percent of the soils are Ultisols, occurring on gentle to steep slopes in the southern range. These soils are low in nutrients. On slopes greater than 25 percent, cucumbertree grows on fine to coarse loams, clays, and on well-drained quartz sands. On slopes up to 25 percent it is confined to coarse loams (28). The remaining soils on which cucumbertree grows are in the order Alfisols.",Soils and Topography,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,15,0
"In general, wildlife use of cucumbertree for food is low; however, the seeds are eaten by several species of birds and small mammals (11). Grackles and blackbirds also eat the young fruit of the cucumber tree (14). Twigs, leaves, and buds are browsed by deer; although cucumbertree is classed as nonpalatable by some investigators (9), others have considered it an important deer plant food in West Virginia during one or more seasons (1). Cucumbertree is a valuable forest and shade tree, highly desirable for ornamental planting because of the showy flowers, fruits, and attractive foliage and bark (18). This species has been planted successfully well north of its native range (4); it grows well in slightly acid, well-drained soil (26). Cucumbertree is used for wood products and resembles yellow-poplar except that the wood is heavier, harder, and stronger (3). This species is commonly used for lumber in the Appalachian Mountains, especially in West Virginia and adjoining States. The wood is usually sold as yellow-poplar; it has not been sold as cucumbertree lumber since 1928 (3). The wood is used in furniture, fixtures, venetian blinds, siding, interior trim, sashes, doors, boxes, and crates (10). Cucumbertree is not as desirable for fuelwood as the denser hardwoods. Compared with hickory, which has a fuel value of 100, cucumbertree has a fuel value of 57 (on a volume basis). Cucumbertree has a specific gravity of 0.44 based on oven-dry weight and green volume, and 0.48 based on oven-dry weight and volume at 12 percent moisture content (27). Generally, the wood is close grained, durable, and susceptible to decay. Sapwood typically is a light color while the heartwood is pale brown. The branches of this species are soft and break easily, making tree climbing difficult (22).",Special Uses,Cucumbertree,magnolia,accuminata,hardwood,16,0
"Digger pine forms a part of variants of seven forest cover types (3) and is a major component of an eighth, Blue Oak-Digger Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 250), where together with blue oak (Quercus douglasii) it forms a climax community in a nearly continuous band around California's Central Valley between valley grasslands and montane forest (21). Associated trees in the cover type Blue Oak-Digger Pine include California buckeye (Aesculus californica), California scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), California black oak (Q. kelloggii), and interior live oak (Q. wislizeni) in the Sierra Nevada; and California buckeye, coast live oak (Q. agrifolia), California black oak, and valley oak (Q. lobata) in the Coast Ranges. Digger pine also grows with western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) in the Pit River drainage of the Modoc Plateau, and Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri) in the southern Coast Range. Predominant shrubs include several manzanita (Arctostaphylos) species, primarily A. manzanita and A. viscida, buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus), redbud (Cercis occidentalis), birchleaf mountain -mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), silktassel (Garrya fremontii), toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), hollyleaf buckthorn (Rhamnus crocea), and western poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum). Digger pine also grows on ultramafic and calcareous soils within several forest types, including Redwood (Type 232) west of Healdsburg, and at the low elevational fringe of Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Madrone (Type 234) and Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244). Within Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245), Digger pine is found on westerly slopes of the southern Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada.

"Temperatures characterizing Digger pine's range span the gamut of coastal to Great Basin climates. Yearly means vary from 10° to 17° C (50° to 62° F), with mean minima of -2° to 3° C (28° to 37° F), in the coolest months, and mean maxima of 31° to 36° C (88° to 97° F) in the warmest months (30). Individual summer days often exceed 38° C (100° F). Few tree species grow over as wide a range in precipitation as Digger pine, with annual averages varying from 250 mm (10 in) at the edge of the Mojave Desert to 1780 mm (70 in) at its upper limits in the Sierra Nevada (6). Sites receiving as little as 80 mm (3 in) of precipitation in a single season continue to support stable populations (30). Despite the apparent diversity in climatic tolerance shown by Digger pine, four climatic conditions characterize most of its natural range: hot, dry summers; absence of summer fog; precipitation, mostly as rain; and generally mild winters. Digger pine's ability to withstand summer drought and to photosynthesize during mild periods of winter and spring give it a strong competitive advantage over many other species in the California foothills.",Climate,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,2,1
"The most obvious variation between Digger pine populations is in cone shape and size (7). Stands in the north Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains tend to bear large, elongated cones, while those in the Sierra Nevada produce cones that are smaller and ovoid. Variation within a population is great enough, however, that small or large cone races probably do not exist. Early claims of a variety explicata (15), based on strongly-hooked cone spurs and relatively long seed wings, are not supported by more recent sampling (7). One isolated Klamath Mountain population, however, tends to have blunt, straight spurs. Cones from the northern part of Digger pine's range tend to have lower specific gravities than those from the southern part. Seeds collected from sites characterized by cold winters and short growing seasons show the slowest germination rates and require longer chilling periods to achieve full germination (6,9), presumably representing a survival advantage for a species whose seeds normally germinate during winter. Despite the ability of Digger pine to reproduce and grow on extremely infertile soils, such as those formed from serpentinite, no strong evidence has been found that edaphic ecotypes exist within the species (8). Digger pine is resistant to interspecific breeding, and no natural hybrids have been recognized although its range overlaps those of several species of pines. It has been successfully crossed artificially with Coulter and Torrey pines (2,7,10).",Genetics,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,7,1
"A California endemic, Digger pine grows between latitude 34° 30' and 41° 15' N. Generally found between elevations of 300 to 900 m (1,000 to 3,000 ft) in dry foothill woodland communities of California's Central Valley, natural stands of Digger pine also grow from as low as 30 m (100 ft) at several locations on the floor of the Sacramento Valley to almost 2130 m (7,000 ft) near Sawtooth Peak in Inyo County (10). Digger pine is found in the Coast and Cascade Ranges, Klamath Mountains, southwestern Modoc Plateau, western Sierra Nevada, and Tehachapi Mountains, and over a broad environmental sweep, from the westerly edge of the Mojave Desert, to the Santa Lucia Mountains in Monterey County within sight of the Pacific surf (6). Digger pine is absent in a conspicuous 89-km (55-mi) gap near its southern Sierra Nevada limit. The cause of the gap is unknown but was noted as early as 1865 (10). - The native range of Digger pine.",Native Range,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Digger pine is monoecious, and strobili appear on short stalks in early spring. Male strobili are 3 to 4 cm (1.2 to 1.6 in) long, green or yellow to reddish purple when immature and light brown when mature. Female strobili are initially small and green or red to purple. When mature they are heavy, ovoid to subglobose, light- to chocolate-brown woody cones. The cone is borne close to the branch on reflexed stalks 5 to 6 cm (2 to 2.5 in) long. Pollination occurs in March through April and archegonia are fertilized in the spring of the next year (16). Cones mature by September or October. Although cones have been noted on 2-year-old trees (30), 10 to 25 years usually must pass to attain full seed production (16). Seeds of Digger pine are large at maturity, averaging 19 to 25 mm (0.75 to 1.0 in) long (30), and weighing up to 1 g (0.04 oz) and more when air-dried (6). Embryos average 18 to 35 mg (0.3 to 0.5 gr) (9) and are surrounded by thick seedcoats. Cleaned seeds average 1,280 per kilogram (580/lb) and range between 1,170 and 1,430 seeds per kilogram (530 and 650/lb). Among the American pines, only Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana) rivals Digger pine in average seed weight (16). One of Digger pine's most prominent features is its massive cones, among the largest produced by any pine species. Fresh cone weights average 0.3 to 0.7 kg (0.7 to 1.5 lb) and may exceed 1 kg (2.2 lb) (7). Lengths often reach 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in), although mature cones can be much smaller. Large elongated cones are frequently found in populations of the north Coast and Klamath Ranges. Smaller ovoid cones are more common in the Sierra Nevada (7). Prominent features of Digger pine cones are the conspicuous spurs that develop at the base of the cone. Formed from the combined umbo and apophysis of the scale, spurs tend to elongate and recurve, giving the cone a spiny appearance that is fairly constant within a tree, but quite variable within and between populations (7). Unlike most other conifers, Digger pine cones do not form an abscission layer of cells where the cone joins the branch. Thus, cones remain attached long after seeds are shed, unless broken from the tree crown by wind or cut from the tree by the western gray squirrel in quest of seed. Seed Production and Dissemination- Compared with other species, Digger pine is a consistent seed producer, with large crops produced at 2- to 3-year intervals. Cones may open slowly so that dispersal, beginning in October, sometimes extends into winter. Although open, cones may contain moderate numbers of seeds as late as February (6,16,30). Digger pine seeds are disseminated in four ways. Wind, usually the primary distributor of seeds for most species, has less influence on Digger pine seeds because wings are poorly developed and seeds are heavy. Birds, primarily the acorn woodpecker and scrub jay, disseminate seed. Gravity also aids distribution of seeds. Digger pine cones, because of their shape and weight, may roll considerable distances on steep hillsides once severed from tree crowns. The large seeds of Digger pine also may roll when dropped from high in the crown. Finally, Digger pine cones are relatively buoyant, with specific gravities varying between 0.59 and 0.96 (7). Cones reaching running water may be transported considerable distances. In one instance, cones were found on a streambank within 13 km (8 mi) of the ocean, and 40 km (25 mi) downstream from the nearest known source (30). Seedling Development- Seeds of Digger pine show both physiological and physical barriers to early germination when field conditions may be unfavorable. Embryos require a moist, near-freezing chilling period of at least 30 days before germination is possible (9,13). Digger pine growing on sites where winter temperatures fluctuate greatly, such as the Modoc Plateau, may have adapted a longer requirement for chilling to prevent germination until spring. Seeds from populations growing on low-elevation sites with milder winters tend to require less chilling, thereby favoring early establishment before soil moisture becomes limiting (9). Digger pine's thick seedcoat provides a formidable obstacle to water imbibition and gas exchange, and cracking it or reducing its thickness improves speed and completeness of germination if the chilling requirement is satisfied (9,13). A further physical barrier is the nucellar cap, and removing it improves germination more than seedcoat removal alone (9). No chemical inhibitors of germination in Digger pine seed are known. Germination is epigeal (16). Seedlings are established best on bare mineral soil and under partial (but not deep) shade. Chaparral cover purportedly helps establishment (29). Cotyledons of Digger pine are unusually large, averaging 49 to 72 mm (1.9 to 2.8 in) in length, and seedlings with cotyledons spanning 20 cm (8 in) tip-to-tip have been noted (6,8). Cotyledon size and number in Digger pine (from 10 to 21 per seedling) help provide enough energy through photosynthesis so that, where soil depth permits, first-year seedlings may develop a deep taproot before soil moisture is depleted in late spring or early summer. Controlled studies show that most of the first season's growth is completed and bud differentiation begins within 5 months of germination. First-year foliage consists mainly of cotyledons and primary needles, although secondary needles (in fascicles of three) may be produced on better sites toward the end of the growing season. Although overall growth is depressed on poor sites, shoot-root ratios tend to be lower as well so that transpiration-absorption deficits may be balanced to some degree (8). Vegetative Reproduction- Digger pine does not reproduce vegetatively in nature. No information is currently available on artificial reproduction.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Early growth rates of Digger pine are among the highest of any conifer-an amazing fact, considering the droughty sites on which the species grows. Annual height growth of Digger pine in its native range may average as much as 70 cm (28 in) for the first 8 years after germination (30) and often exceeds 1 m (3 ft) during specific years. When introduced to Challenge Experimental Forest in northern California, a very productive Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer site at 790 m (2,590 ft) elevation, dominant and codominant Digger pine averaged 10.3 m (33.8 ft) in height and 19.3 cm (7.6 in) in d.b.h. 15 years after planting (25). Growth can begin with the first fall rains and continue until soils become too dry in the spring or early summer (18). Within the natural range, high annual rates of growth probably reflect a long growing season that begins early, rather than rapid growth on a daily basis. Digger pine's sparse foliage suggests that daily rates of growth probably are low. On more productive timber sites, the growing season may begin later but extend further into the summer, producing growth rates similar to those on the best low-elevation sites within its natural range. In one study, height and diameter growth rates of Digger pine on a high quality site were comparable, but not superior, to those of native ponderosa pine (25). The stem form of Digger pine seemingly disregards gravity. Even on steep slopes it may grow nearly perpendicular to the ground. Trees usually maintain a straight, conical form into the pole stage, but mature trees generally are twisted and have multiple forks. The poor form of mature trees probably is a genetic trait but may be traced partly to an open-grown nature that exposes the trees to the damaging effects of wind and to the tendency of lateral buds to elongate when the terminal bud remains static (6). Although Digger pine stands may approach stocking densities of 46 m² basal area per hectare (200 ft²/acre) (25), most stands are stocked much more lightly. Mature trees average 12 to 24 m (40 to 80 ft) in height and 30 to 90 cm (12 to 36 in) in d.b.h. The largest Digger pine officially recorded measured 48.8 m (160 ft) tall, 160 cm (63 in) in d.b.h., and had a crown spread averaging 20.7 m (68 ft) at the widest points (22). Size and age potentials are not determined easily from the trees existing today, because miners, wood cutters, and agriculturalists cleared Digger pine from its best sites more than a century ago. The maximum age reached by this species probably exceeds 200 years. Rooting Habit- Digger pine produces a deep taproot where soil depth permits. However, hardpan soils are common along the margins of California's Great Valley, and this causes trees to have spreading but shallow root systems with weak taproots extending through duripans. Large trees growing on such sites are windthrown easily during the winter if windstorms coincide with waterlogged soil conditions. Reaction to Competition- Beyond the seedling stage, Digger pine is one of the least shade tolerant of all trees. It is classed as very intolerant of shade. The vigor of Digger pine declines rapidly when competing with such dense-crowned associates as ponderosa pine, blue oak, California black oak, and the live oaks. The wide spacing of Digger pine on xeric sites probably stems from root competition for soil moisture, rather than from mutual competition for light. On mesic sites with better soil development, the sparse crowns of even-aged Digger pine stands allow enough light penetration for needles to persist for 3 years, and stand densities may approach those of moderately-stocked ponderosa pine stands (25). Digger pine's ability to persist and sometimes dominate on xeric sites on zonal soils probably results from its capacity to photosynthesize throughout the winter and early spring when soil moisture is abundant, and to minimize transpiration losses of water during dry seasons through low foliar biomass and good stomatal action. On zonal soils of more mesic sites, Digger pine cannot compete with forest vegetation. Where they grow together in natural ecotones, ponderosa pine has more stomates per needle than Digger pine and maintains slightly lower leaf water potentials (33). This, coupled with its greater foliar density, gives ponderosa pine a growth advantage where soil moisture is adequate. However, Digger pine's sparse crown (and presumably lower absolute transpiration loss) gives it a sizable survival advantage where soil moisture is scarce. Digger pine's ability to survive and grow slowly even under severe drought may not be helpful if it is introduced to more mesic sites. During 3 years of normal precipitation at Challenge Experimental Forest, height growth of planted Digger pine averaged 76 cm (30 in) per year-an average almost identical to the 74 cm (29 in) for native ponderosa pine (25). Annual height growth decreased 29 percent in Digger pine during 2 years of drought, however, compared with a decrease of only 12 percent for ponderosa pine. Digger pine competes well on soils with calcium imbalances. On serpentinite soils, where calcium availability is low and magnesium availability high, Digger pine probably owes its success to low nutrient requirements and preferential absorption of calcium and exclusion of magnesium. These traits have been identified in some populations of ponderosa pine (14,24). On limestone soils, where calcium is abundant, calcium concentrations remain relatively low in Digger pine foliage (34). Results from such extreme soil conditions suggest that Digger pine is unusually effective in regulating its calcium supply. Damaging Agents- Because of the species' ability to grow throughout the winter, succulent shoots of Digger pine are damaged easily by sudden frosts after periods of mild temperature. Digger pine also is particularly susceptible to damage by wind and hail (31). On sites where winter temperatures fluctuate greatly, stable populations may have evolved such adaptive strategies as delayed germination of seed (9). The thin bark of young trees, along with the species' high resin content and the presence of congealed flows that have dripped from wounds, make Digger pine susceptible to severe damage by fire. Prominent diseases of Digger pine include western gall rust (Peridermium harknessii) and dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium occidentale). Western gall rust forms branch galls on Digger pine throughout its range but rarely causes appreciable damage or death. Dwarf mistletoe is a particularly damaging disease that is widely distributed in even the most open stands (12,26). Once infection is established, dwarf mistletoe spreads rapidly (11). Growth loss, deformity, and death often result with the buildup of the disease, and trees of all sizes are susceptible. Digger pine also is susceptible to Heterobasidion annosum root disease. This pathogen seldom is a problem in open stands, although the disease can spread rapidly in well stocked stands, such as plantations (1). Digger pine is host to a wide variety of cone, twig, and foliage insects and is the specific host for Ips spinifer, an aggressive bark beetle that often kills trees weakened by fire or drought (5). Heavy production of resin by healthy trees provides a strong defense against many bark beetles, and vapors from its resins are toxic to some (28). Nevertheless, heavy production of resin favors a pitch nodule moth (Petrova sabiniana), which pupates within resin nodules (5). Thick seedcoats provide a protective barrier against damage from most seed insects, but much of the seed production is consumed by rodents and birds. However, predation does not seem to restrict Digger pine's range (32).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,14,1
"Digger pine grows on soils in five soil orders (Alfisol, Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Ultisols) derived from a wide variety of geologic materials including granodiorite, dacite, andesite, basalt, peridotite, greenstone, schists of various types, limestone, river gravels, and sandstone. The striking feature in much of Digger pine's range is its association with ultramafic soils, particularly those formed from serpentinite. Inclusions of serpentinite or limestone in upland zonal soils produce nutritional imbalances that allow Digger pine to persist within the mixed-conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada and the conifer-hardwood forest of the north Coast Ranges (6). Soils supporting stable populations of Digger pine characteristically have low levels of available moisture. Even on sites where soil moisture is relatively high, Digger pine tends to dominate only the shallowest phases. Although found on deep, alluvial valley terraces, Digger pine has been eliminated systematically from many fertile sites by stockmen seeking to increase grass production (6,18,30). Today, many of the sites still supporting Digger pine consist of dry rolling hills, rocky slopes, and steep canyon walls. Few conifer species can match Digger pine's ability to persist under such xeric, sterile conditions.",Soils and Topography,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,15,1
"Seeds of Digger pine have considerable nutritional value. Their protein and fat contents are similar to those of Pinus pinea (a pine of the Mediterranean region whose seeds are harvested for the table), and are equal or superior to those of other commercial species (4). Although Digger pine seeds are not raised commercially, they once were an important supplement to the diet of California valley Indians (23,30). Digger pine wood has many favorable properties that determine its special uses. Its 0.43 mean specific gravity almost matches that of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and its strength properties are comparable with those of ponderosa pine (27). Kraft pulps made from Digger pine rate high in bursting and tensile strength and compare favorably with pulps from most northern conifers (19). Poor form, high resin content, high proportions of compression wood, and low stand density, however, characterize a species commanding only minor commercial interest today. Currently, the tree's primary value is as a source of railroad tie material, with secondary values for box shook, pallet stock, and chips (17). Digger pine is expensive to log because of its low stand density, and to transport because of its heavy weight and often crooked form. Consequently, stumpage prices are low (17). One of Digger pine's few commercial advantages is that foothill stands can be logged during winter, when species at higher elevations often are inaccessible. Also, some potential exists as stock for shelterbelt plantings on and sites (29). Normal heptane, an alkane hydrocarbon of rare occurrence in woody tissues, is the principal constituent of Digger pine wood turpentine and constitutes about 3 percent of needle and twig oil (20).",Special Uses,Digger Pine,pinus,sabiniana,conifer,16,1
"Periodic recurrence of catastrophic wildfires created vast, almost pure stands of coastal Douglas-fir throughout its range north of the Umpqua River in Oregon. Although logging has mainly eliminated the original old-growth forest, clearcutting combined with slash burning has helped maintain Douglas-fir as the major component in second-growth stands. Where regeneration of Douglas-fir was only partially successful or failed, red alder (Alnus rubra) has become an associate of Douglas-fir or has replaced it altogether. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows in extensive pure stands, uneven- and even-aged, in southern Idaho and northern Utah and in western Montana as a broad belt between ponderosa pine and spruce-fir zones. At high elevations or northerly latitudes, more cold-tolerant mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), true firs (Abies spp.), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), western white pine (Pinus monticola), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) gradually replace Douglas-fir. Douglas-fir yields to ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), Oregon white oak Quercus garryana), California black oak (Q. kelloggii), canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis), and interior live oak (Q. wislizeni) on droughty sites, and to western redcedar (Thuja plicata), maples (Acer spp.), red alder, black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), and other broad-leaved species on poorly drained sites. Toward the fog belt of the Pacific coast, Douglas-fir gives way to Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and western redcedar. The variety menziesii is a major component of four forest cover types (20): Pacific Douglas-Fir (Society of American Foresters Type 229), Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock (Type 230), Port Orford-Cedar (Type 231), and Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244). It is a minor component of the following types: 221 Red Alder 223 Sitka Spruce 224 Western Hemlock 225 Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce 226 Coastal True Fir-Hemlock 227 Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock 228 Western Redcedar 232 Redwood 233 Oregon White Oak 234 Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone The variety glauca is a principal species in three forest cover types: Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Western Larch (Type 212), and Grand Fir (Type 213). It is a minor species in five types: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206), White Fir (Type 211), Western White Pine (Type 215), Aspen (Type 217), and Lodgepole Pine (Type 218). Wherever Douglas-fir grows in mixture with other species, the proportion may vary greatly, depending on aspect, elevation, kind of soil, and the past history of an area, especially as it relates to fire. This is particularly true of the mixed conifer stands in the southern Rocky Mountains where Douglas-fir is associated with ponderosa pine, southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis), corkbark fir (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica), white fir (Abies concolor), blue spruce (Picea pungens), Engelmann spruce, and aspen (Populus spp.). The most important shrubs associated with coastal Douglas-fir (21) through its central and northern range are vine maple (Acer circinatum), salal (Gaultheria shallon), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium), and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis). Toward the drier southern end of its range, common shrub associates are California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), creeping snowberry (Symphoricarpos mollis), western poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.), and manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.). Principal understory species associated with variety glauca differ within its range (3). In the northern part, they are common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), white spirea (Spirea betulifolia), ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), and pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites). In the central part, they are true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), squaw currant (Ribes cereum), chokeberry (Prunus virginiana), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), and bush rockspirea (Holodiscus dumosus); in the southern part they are New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), and oceanspray (3).",Associated Forest Cover,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,1,1
"Douglas-fir grows under a wide variety of climatic conditions (table 1). The coastal region of the Pacific Northwest has a maritime climate characterized by mild, wet winters and cool, relatively dry summers, a long frost-free season, and narrow diurnal fluctuations of temperature (6° to 8° C; 43° to 46° F). Precipitation, mostly as rain, is concentrated in the winter months. Climate in the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada tends to be more severe. Altitude has a significant effect on local climate. In general, temperature decreases and precipitation increases with increasing elevation on both western and eastern slopes of the mountains. Winters are colder, frost-free seasons are shorter, and diurnal fluctuations of temperature are larger (10° to 16° C; 50° to 61° F). Much of the precipitation is snow. In the northern Rocky Mountains, Douglas-fir grows in a climate with a marked maritime influence. Mild continental climate prevails in all seasons, except midsummer. Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year, except for a dry period in July and August. In the central Rocky Mountains, the climate is continental. Winters are long and severe; summers are hot and in some parts of the region, very dry. Annual precipitation, higher on the western sides of the mountains, is mainly snow. Rainfall patterns for the southern Rocky Mountains generally show low winter precipitation east of the Continental Divide but high precipitation during the growing season. West of the Continental Divide, the rainfall is more evenly divided between winter and summer. Frost may occur in any month in the northern part of the range. Length of frost-free periods, however, varies within the central and southern Rocky Mountain regions, even at the same elevations.",Climate,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,2,1
"The genus Pseudotsuga includes two species (P. menziesii and P. macrocarpa) indigenous to North America and five species native to Asia. All except P. menziesii have a karyotype of 2N=24, the number of chromosomes characteristic of Pinaceae. But the Douglas-fir karyotype is 2N=26, a probable reason for the general failure of hybridization trials with this species (56).",Genetics,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,7,1
"Douglas-fir has one of the broadest ranges of any North American conifer, much of it over extremely dissected terrain, and the species exhibits a great deal of genetic differentiation. Much of this variation is strongly associated with geographic or topographic features (47). Thus, clinal patterns of variation in growth and pherrological traits have been observed over north-south, east-west, and elevational transects despite the appreciable gene flow expected in this species. Adaptive patterns of genetic variation also occur among Douglas-fir populations within local regions. For example, evidence exists for ""aspect races"" in variety menziesii: Seedlings grown from seed collected on the more xeric southern aspects grow slower, set buds earlier, and form larger roots in relation to shoots than seedlings grown from seeds collected on adjacent north-facing slopes. Seedlings from seed sources on the south aspect have characteristics consistent with adaptation to the shorter growing seasons and drier soil conditions generally found on south-facing slopes and may be better able to survive under drought stress than seedlings from north-aspect seed sources (33). Topoclinal variation in response to microenvironmental heterogeneity has also been found in the central part of the Oregon Cascades (11).",Hybrids,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,9,1
"The latitudinal range of Douglas-fir is the greatest of any commercial conifer of western North America. Its native range, extending from latitude 19° to 55° N., resembles an inverted V with uneven sides. From the apex in central British Columbia, the shorter arm extends south along the Pacific Coast Ranges for about 2200 km (1,367 mi) to latitude 34° 44' N., representing the range of the typical coastal or green variety, menziesii; the longer arm stretches along the Rocky Mountains into the mountains of central Mexico over a distance of nearly 4500 km (2,796 mi), comprising the range of the other recognized variety, glauca- Rocky Mountain or blue. Nearly pure stands of Douglas-fir continue south from their northern limit on Vancouver Island through western Washington, Oregon, and the Klamath and Coast Ranges of northern California as far as the Santa Cruz Mountains. In the Sierra Nevada, Douglas-fir is a common part of the mixed conifer forest as far south as the Yosemite region. The range of Douglas-fir is fairly continuous through northern Idaho, western Montana, and northwestern Wyoming. Several outliers are present in Alberta and the eastern-central parts of Montana and Wyoming, the largest being in the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming. In northeastern Oregon, and from southern Idaho south through the mountains of Utah, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, extreme western Texas, and northern Mexico, the distribution becomes discontinuous. - The native range of Douglas-fir.",Native Range,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,11,1
"Pseudotsuga menziesii has two widely recognized varieties: menziesii, the green variety indigenous to the area west of the summit of the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon and of the Sierra Nevada in California; and glauca, the blue Douglas-fir native to the interior mountains of the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains in the United States, and to Mexico. The division between the two varieties is not as clearly defined in Canada, although menziesii is commonly considered indigenous to the area west of the crest of the mainland Coast and Cascade Ranges. The varieties differ in both growth rate and size at maturity, menziesii being more rapid growing and much larger. In habit, glauca is more shade tolerant, has a more pronounced tap root, is more susceptible to Rhabdocline pseudotsugae when grown in a moist environment, and is significantly more cold hardy. The coastal and interior varieties also differ in botanical and morphological characteristics. Because of variation within the two recognized varieties, it has been suggested that variety glauca be replaced with several varieties, and many forms have been reported. Chemical and cytological investigations have shown differences both between and within the two varieties, but such work has not led to further differentiation (38,48).",Population Differences,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Douglas-fir is monoecious; trees commonly begin to produce strobili at 12 to 15 years of age, although observations of younger seedlings bearing ovulate strobili have been reported. Primordia of both pollen and seed cone buds are present when the vegetative bud breaks in the spring of the year before the cone crop. But neither can be distinguished from primordia of vegetative buds for the first 10 weeks of their existence. By mid-June, histochemical differences separate the pollen cone primordia, which are usually clustered near the base of the extending shoot, from the seed cone primordia, which are borne singly near the acropetal end of the shoot, and from the vegetative bud primordia (5). These three primordia may be microscopically identified in mid-July; by September, the egg-shaped pollen cone buds are easily distinguished by the naked eye from the darker vegetative buds and the larger seed cone buds. The size of the cone crop is determined by the number of primordia that differentiate and develop into buds, not by the number formed. Poor cone crops, then, reflect a high abortion rate of primordia the preceding year. Large numbers of pollen or seed cone buds in the fall merely indicate the potential for a heavy cone crop the following year. Damaging frost during cone anthesis or depredations by insects may destroy most of the cones and seeds before they mature (19). Male strobili are about 2 cm (0.8 in) long and range from yellow to deep red. Female strobili are about 3 cm (1.2 in) long and range from deep green to deep red (45). They have large trident bracts and are receptive to pollination soon after emergence. Anthesis and pollination of variety menziesii occur during March and April in the warmer part of the range and as late as May or early June in the colder areas. At low and middle elevations, Douglas-fir cones mature and seeds ripen from mid-August in southern Oregon to mid-September in northern Washington and southern British Columbia. Mature cones are 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long. The bracts turn brown when seeds are mature (45). Seedfall occurs soon after cone maturity with, generally, two-thirds of the total crop on the ground by the end of October. The remaining seeds fall during winter and spring months. In British Columbia, seedfall starts later and lasts longer-less than half the seeds fall by late October and more than one-third fall after March 1. In general, Douglas-fir seedfall in the fog belt of western North America is more protracted than in the drier areas east of the summit of the Coast Ranges. The phenology of flowering is similar for variety glauca; early flowering occurs in mid-April to early May in Colorado and as late as early May to late June in northern Idaho. Cone ripening varies from late July at the lower elevations (about 850 m or 2,800 ft) in Montana to mid-August in northern Idaho. Seed dispersal of glauca begins in mid-August in central Oregon and occurs as late as mid-September at higher elevations (about 1710 m or 5,600 ft) in Montana (45). Seed quality varies during the seedfall period. It is high in the fall but declines rapidly during winter and spring. This pattern probably reflects the fact that cone scales in the center of the cone, where the highest quality seed are borne, open early and scales at the tip and base of the cone, which bear generally poorly formed seeds, open late. Both cones and seeds vary greatly in size; the smaller seeds (about 132,000/kg or 60,000/lb) occur on trees in British Columbia and the larger seeds (about 51,000/kg or 23,000/lb), on trees in California. Seeds of variety glauca are slightly heavier and more triangular in shape than seeds of menziesii. Size is determined before fertilization, so there is no correlation between weight of seed and genetic vigor, although seedlings germinated from heavier seeds may be slightly larger the first few months of growth than those grown from lighter seeds. Because the range in seed size from any one tree is relatively small, however, fractionation of seed lots to segregate the heavier seed may reduce the genetic variation and actually eliminate traits from certain populations. Douglas-fir seed crops occur at irregular intervals- one heavy and one medium crop every 7 years on the average; however, even during heavy seed years, only about 25 percent of the trees produce an appreciable number of cones (34). Trees 200 to 300 years old produce the greatest number of cones. For example, a stand of old-growth Douglas-fir may produce 20 to 30 times the number of cones per hectare that a second-growth stand 50 to 100 years old produces. Seed Production and Dissemination- Major deterrents to natural regeneration of Douglas-fir include limited seed supply; consumption of seed by insects, animals, and birds; competing plant species; and unfavorable environments. Although reports of fully stocked stands resulting from seedfall from sources 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1.2 mi) distant are not rare, the great majority of Douglas-fir seeds fall within 100 m (330 ft) of a seed tree or stand edge (18). Data describing the quantities of seeds that may fall vary widely, but most years are characterized by less than 2.2 kg/ha (2 lb/acre), of which no more than 40 percent is sound. Years with poor seed crops generally have a lower percentage of viable seeds, perhaps because the low incidence of fruiting trees may favor a higher level of selfing (25). Seedling Development- Douglas-fir germination is epigeal. Seed germinates in mid-March to early April in the warmer portions of the range and as late as mid-May in the cooler areas. Seedling growth the first year is indeterminate but relatively slow and limited generally by moisture, which triggers initiation of dormancy in midsummer. The dormant period normally extends from midsummer until April or May of the following year (37). Douglas-fir can produce lammas shoots, but this habit is confined to either the more moist portion of the range or to years with abnormally heavy summer rainfall. This habit is probably most pronounced in the southern Rockies, where the summer period is characterized by irregular, heavy rainstorms. In any event, the great majority of the annual shoot growth occurs during the initial flush. First-year seedlings on better sites in the Pacific Northwest may develop shoots 6 to 9 cm (2.5 to 3.5 in) long. Growth in subsequent years is determinate and gradually accelerates so that when saplings are 8 to 10 years old, terminal growth may consistently exceed 1 m (3.3 ft) per year on the more productive sites. Seedlings of the variety menziesii normally survive best when the seed germinates on moist mineral soil, but menziesii will tolerate a light litter layer. Seedlings do not survive well, however, on heavy accumulations of organic debris. In contrast, seedlings of the variety glauca are favored by a duff layer, especially in the larch forests of northwestern Montana (53). First-year seedlings survive and grow best under light shade, especially on southerly exposures, but older seedlings require full sunlight. Particularly in the fog belt, competing vegetation such as alder, maple, salmonberry, and thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus) limits Douglas-fir regeneration by creating intolerable levels of shade; plants such as grasses, manzanita, ceanothus, and oak compete strongly for available moisture; and plants such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and vetch (Vicia spp.) smother small seedlings with leaves and other debris. Successful regeneration of variety menziesii often depends on weed control in the commercial range of Douglas-fir because many associated plant species have growth rates much greater than that of juvenile Douglas-fir (8). For this reason, regeneration may be more reliable after a wildfire, which destroys the reservoir of potential competitive species, than after a harvest operation, which leaves areas well suited to the rapid proliferation of the herbaceous and woody competitors of Douglas-fir. In the Rocky Mountains, competing vegetation may promote the establishment of variety glauca seedlings by reducing temperature stress and may inhibit seedling growth by competing strongly for moisture. The latter effect is most pronounced in the southern portions of glauca's range. Microsites with adverse moisture and temperature conditions frequently limit establishment of both menziesii and glauca seedlings on southerly aspects (32). Soil surface temperatures in excess of 65° C (149° F) are prevalent in the southern Cascade Range and Siskiyou Mountains and are common in the Cascades even as far north as Mount Rainier. Prolonged droughts, which may extend from May through September, are frequent in southern Oregon and northern California, and low annual precipitation and high evaporation stress greatly limit the distribution of glauca in the Rocky Mountains. Like nearly all perennial woody plants, Douglas-fir is dependent on a mycorrhizal relationship for efficient uptake of mineral nutrients and water. Approximately 2,000 species of fungi have been identified as potential symbionts with Douglas-fir, and both ectomycorrhizal and ectendomycorrhizal structures have been observed on this species (59). Occasionally, nursery practices result in seedlings with few mycorrhizae, but no deficiencies in mycorrhizal infection have been reported for natural seedlings. Historically, large burned or cleared areas in the range of variety menziesii, such as those on Vancouver Island (52), have naturally seeded into nearly pure stands of Douglas-fir. On mesic to moist sites this process may occur over a relatively short period, perhaps 10 to 15 years. On drier sites, such regeneration may be quite protracted and require a hundred or more years. Stocking of harvested areas has been extremely variable during the past 30 years, and large tracts in the drier or cooler portions of the range are covered by brush species such as manzanita, ceanothus, salmonberry, salal, or lower value hardwoods, such as alder, maple, and oak. Regeneration of variety glauca in the Rocky Mountains has also been variable. In general, glauca may be considered a seral species in moist habitats and a climax component in the warmer, drier areas. Regeneration is favored where Douglas-fir is seral, especially in northern Idaho and western Montana where a strong maritime influence modifies the generally continental climate that prevails in the central and southerly Rocky Mountains. In contrast, regeneration of Douglas-fir is poor where the species has attained climax status (49). From 1950 until about 1970, large areas of cutover and burned-over forest land in the Pacific Northwest were aerially seeded. Direct seeding suffers from the same deficiencies as natural regeneration, however; that is, stands produced are often uneven in stocking and require interplanting or pre-commercial thinning, and animals destroy a large proportion of the seeds. With the advent of greatly increased forest nursery capacity, direct seeding is much less common (13,54). Vegetative Reproduction- Douglas-fir does not naturally reproduce vegetatively. Substantial research to develop cuttings as a regeneration procedure has demonstrated that reliable rooting of cuttings is limited to material collected from trees less than 10 years old, or from trees that have been subjected to repeated shearing to regenerate material with a juvenile habit. A second major impediment to the use of cuttings as a regeneration technique for this species is that most such material has a period of plagiotropic growth, which may be lengthy, before the erect habit is assumed. Research with tissue culture techniques has demonstrated substantial promise, but widespread use of this technique in reforestation of the Douglas-fir region is, at best, a future possibility.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Natural stands of coastal Douglas-fir normally start with more than 2,500 trees per hectare (1,000/acre). Planted stands generally have between 750 and 1,500/ha (300 and 600/acre) at the beginning (9). Annual height increment is relatively slow the first 5 years but then begins to accelerate. Coastal Douglas-fir attains the largest height increments between 20 and 30 years of age but retains the ability to maintain a fairly rapid rate of height growth over a long period. Douglas-fir in high-elevation forests of the Oregon-Washington Cascade Range can continue height growth at a substantial rate for more than 200 years (15). Height growth of Douglas-fir on dry sites at mid-site indices in the Cascade Range of western Oregon is similar to that of upper-slope Douglas-fir in the Washington and Oregon Cascade Range. At higher site indices, however, height growth on dry sites is initially faster but slower later in life; at lower site indices, it is initially slower but faster later in life (40). On a medium site (III) at low elevations, height growth, which averages 61 cm (24 in) annually at age 30, continues at a rate of 15 cm (6 in) per year at age 100, and 9 cm (3.6 in) at age 120 (18,39). Trees 150 to 180 cm (60 to 72 in) in diameter and 76 m (250 ft) in height are common in old-growth forests (22). The tallest tree on record, found near Little Rock, WA, was 100.5 m (330 ft) tall and had a diameter of 182 cm (71.6 in). Coastal Douglas-fir is very long lived; ages in excess of 500 years are not uncommon and some have exceeded 1,000 years. The oldest Douglas-fir of which there is an authentic record stood about 48 km (30 mi) east of Mount Vernon, WA. It was slightly more than 1,400 years old when cut (39). Information about yields of coastal Douglas-fir under intensive management for an entire rotation is still limited. It is therefore necessary to rely either on estimates based on yields from unmanaged stands, or on yields from intensively managed stands in regions where Douglas-fir has been introduced as an exotic (12), or on growth models (16). If measured in cubic volume of wood produced, range in productivity between the best and poorest sites is more than 250 percent. Depending on site quality, mean annual net increments at age 50 vary from 3.7 to 13.4 m³/ha (53 to 191 ft³/acre) in unmanaged stands (39). Estimates of gross yields may increase these values as much as 80 percent, depending on mensurational techniques and assumptions. Comparisons of gross yields from unmanaged stands with those from managed stands of the same site indexes in Europe and New Zealand suggest that yields in managed stands will be considerably higher than would be indicated by estimates based on yields in unmanaged stands. Presumably, managed stands of coastal Douglas-fir can produce mean annual increments of 7 m³/ha (100 ft³/acre) on poor sites and exceed 28 m³/ha (400 ft³/acre) on the highest sites under rotations between 50 and 80 years (55). Although information on productivity of Douglas-fir in terms of total biomass production is still limited, indications are that it may reach 1000 t/ha (447 tons/acre) on high sites (22). The interior variety of Douglas-fir does not attain the growth rates, dimensions, or age of the coastal variety. Site class for Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is usually IV or V (site index 24 to 37 m or 80 to 120 ft at age 100) when compared with the growth of this species in the Pacific Northwest (1,43). On low sites, growth is sometimes so slow that trees do not reach saw-log size before old age and decadence overtake them. Interior Douglas-fir reaches an average height of 30 to 37 m (100 to 120 ft) with a d.b.h. between 38 and 102 cm (15 and 40 in) in 200 to 300 years. On the best sites, dominant trees may attain a height of 49 m (160 ft) and a d.b.h. of 152 cm (60 in) (23). Diameter growth becomes extremely slow and height growth practically ceases after age 200. Interior Douglas-fir, however, appears capable of response to release by accelerated diameter growth at any size or age (35). The interior variety is not as long lived as the coastal variety and rarely lives more than 400 years, although more than 700 annual rings have been counted on stumps (23). Gross volume yields for Douglas-fir east of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington range from 311 m³/ha (4,442 ft³/acre) for site index 15.2 m or 50 ft (at age 50) to 1523 m³/ha (21,759 ft³/acre) for site index 33.5 m (110 ft) (14). In the northern Rocky Mountains, estimates of yield capabilities of habitat types where Douglas-fir is climax range from about 1.4 to 7 m³/ha (20 to 100 ft³/acre) per year to more than 9.8 m³/ha (140 ft³/acre) per year in some of the more moist habitat types where Douglas-fir is seral (46). Information on yields of Douglas-fir in the southern Rocky Mountain region is scant. In New Mexico, a virgin stand of Douglas-fir (61 percent) and associated species averaged 182 m³/ha (13,000 fbm/acre). Occasionally, stands yield as high as 840 m³/ha (60,000 fbm/acre). Annual growth rates from 2.0 to 3.9 m³/ha (140 to 280 fbm/acre) after partial cutting have been reported in New Mexico (17). Rooting Habit- Although Douglas-fir is potentially a deep-rooting species, its root morphology varies according to the nature of the soil. In the absence of obstructions, Douglas-fir initially forms a tap root that grows rapidly during the first few years. In deep soils (69 to 135 cm, 27 to 53 in), it was found that tap roots grew to about 50 percent of their final depth in 3 to 5 years, and to 90 percent in 6 to 8 years; however, boulders or bedrock close to the soil surface result in quick proliferation of the original tap root. Platelike root systems develop when Douglas-fir grows in shallow soils or soils with a high water table. Main lateral branches develop during the first or second growing season as branches of the tap root. These structural roots tend to grow obliquely into deeper soil layers and contribute to anchoring a tree. The majority of roots in the surface soil are long rope-like laterals of secondary and tertiary origin. Fine roots, those less than 0.5 cm (0.2 in) in diameter, develop mostly from smaller lateral roots and are concentrated in the upper 20 cm (8 in) of soil (29). Fine roots have a short life-span, ranging in general from a few days to several weeks. Cyclic death and replacement of fine roots changes seasonally, reflecting changes in environmental conditions (51). Size of the root system appears to be related to size of the crown rather than the bole. In British Columbia, ratios of root spread to crown width averaged 1.1 for open- and 0.9 for forest-grown Douglas-fir, but greater lateral spread has been observed on poorly drained sand and sandy gravel soils. The radial symmetry of root systems seems to be readily distorted by slope, proximity to other trees, and presence of old roots. Observations in the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains indicate that roots of Douglas-fir extend farther downslope than upslope. The proportion of root biomass decreases with age and may vary from 50 percent at age 21 to less than 20 percent in stands older than 100 years (29). Root grafting is very common in stands of Douglas-fir, often leading to a system of interconnected roots in older stands (36). Reaction to Competition- Except in its youth, when it is reasonably tolerant of shade, coastal Douglas-fir is classed as intermediate in overall shade tolerance, below most of its common associates in tolerance to shade (42). Of these associates, ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), incense-cedar, noble fir (Abies procera), and red alder are more demanding of light. In its interior range, Douglas-fir ranks intermediate in tolerance among its associates, being more tolerant than western larch, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, southwestern white pine, and aspen (23). The coastal variety is a seral species, except on extremely dry sites in southwestern Oregon and northern California. In its interior range, Douglas-fir is both a climax and a seral species. In the northern Rocky Mountains, it replaces ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and western larch above the ponderosa pine belt, and in turn is replaced by western redcedar, western hemlock, Engelmann spruce, grand fir, and subalpine fir on cooler and wetter sites. In the southern Rocky Mountains, Douglas-fir is a climax species in several habitat types of mixed conifer forest and a seral species in the spruce-fir forests (4). The natural occurrence of Douglas-fir in extensive stands is mainly a consequence of forest fires. The species' rapid growth and longevity, the thick corky bark of its lower boles and main roots, combined with its capacity to form adventitious roots, are the main adaptations that have enabled Douglas-fir to survive less fire-resistant associates and to remain a dominant element in western forests. Without fire or other drastic disturbance, Douglas-fir would gradually be replaced throughout much of its range by the more tolerant hemlock, cedar, and true fir. Old-growth forests of Douglas-fir tend to show wide ranges in age structure-rather than being even-aged- which indicates that Douglas-fir was not established over short periods after major fires or other disturbances (22). Stands of vigorous Douglas-fir can be successfully regenerated by any of the even-aged methods. Clear cutting in combination with planting is the most widely used method. In stands infected with dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.), clearcutting is the best alternative for eliminating the disease. If clearcutting on good sites results in establishment of red alder, Douglas-fir is at a severe disadvantage. Alder has very rapid juvenile growth on high sites and can easily over top and suppress Douglas-fir. If Douglas-fir is released in time, however, its subsequent development will actually benefit from the nitrogen fixed by red alder. Nitrogen is the only nutrient in forest soils of the Pacific Northwest (41) and Intermountain Northwest (44) that has been shown to be limiting to growth of Douglas-fir. Because of its ability to tolerate shade in the seedling stage, the shelterwood system is a feasible alternative to clearcutting in coastal stands (64). Shelterwood cutting has been practiced only on a limited scale in the Pacific Northwest, however, where the large dimensions of old-growth timber, danger of blowdown to the residual stand, and probability of brush encroachment limit its use. In the Rocky Mountains, shelterwood cutting has been more commonly applied and with good results (50). Where interior Douglas-fir is climax, the true selection method can be used. It is unsuitable for coastal Douglas-fir. Although Douglas-fir may be regenerated either naturally or artificially from seed, the erratic spacing characteristic of many naturally regenerated stands and the general lack of reliability of this system have resulted in legislation (Forestry Practices Acts) in Washington, Oregon, and California that virtually mandates artificial regeneration. And, because direct seeding also produces variable results, the regeneration system uses 2-year-old bare root seedlings, 3-year-old transplants, year-old container-grown seedlings, or 2-year-old transplants that were grown the first year in containers (9). Such planting stock may be affected by agents discussed here under the heading ""Damaging Agents"" or may suffer mortality from a lack of vigor occasioned by improper production and harvest practices, from poor planting practices, and from frost damage incurred either in nursery beds or after planting (13). When Douglas-fir develops in a closed stand, the lower limbs die rapidly as they are increasingly subjected to overhead shade. Nevertheless, natural pruning is exceedingly slow because even small dead limbs resist decay and persist for a very long period. On the average, Douglas-fir is not clear to a height of 5 m (17 ft) until 77 years old, and to 10 m (33 ft) until 107 years. Obviously, natural pruning will not produce clear butt logs in rotations of less than 150 years. Artificial pruning will greatly reduce the time required to produce clear lumber but may result in severe grain distortion and brittle grain structure around pruning wounds (10). Seedlings and saplings of Douglas-fir respond satisfactorily to release from competing brush or overstory trees if they have not been suppressed too severely or too long. Trees of pole and small sawtimber size in general respond very well to thinning. Trees that have developed in a closed stand, however, are poorly adapted to radical release, such as that occasioned by very heavy thinning. When exposed, the long slender holes with short crowns are highly susceptible to damage from snowbreak, windfall, and sunscald. Sudden and drastic release of young Douglas-fir may cause a sharp temporary reduction in height growth (57). Application of a nitrogen fertilizer in combination with thinning gives better growth responses in Douglas-fir than either fertilizer or thinning alone (41). Damaging Agents- From seed to maturity, Douglas-fir is subject to serious damage from a variety of agents. Douglas-fir is host to hundreds of fungi, but relatively few of these cause serious problems. Various species of Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytophthora, Fusarium, and Botrytis may cause significant losses of seedlings in nurseries (58,60), whereas Rhizina undulata, shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea), and laminated root rot (Phellinus weirii) have caused significant damage in plantations. In fact, the latter two fungi represent a serious threat to management of young-growth stands of Douglas-fir, especially west of the summit of the Cascades. Trees die or are so weakened that they are blown over. Effective control measures are not available. Of the many heart rot fungi (more than 300) attacking Douglas-fir, the most damaging and widespread is red ring rot (Phellinus pini). Knots and scars resulting from fire, lightning, and falling trees are the main courts of infection. Losses from this heart rot far exceed those from any other decay. Other important heart rot fungi in the Pacific Northwest are Fomitopsis officinalis, F. cajanderi, and Phaeolus schweinitzii (28). In the Southwest, Echinodontium tinctorium, Fomitopsis cajanderi, and F. pinicola are important. Several needle diseases occur on Douglas-fir. The most conspicuous, a needlecast, is caused by Rhabdocline pseudotsugae. It is mainly a disease of younger trees, reaching damaging proportions only after prolonged periods of rain while the new needles are appearing. The interior variety is particularly susceptible to the disease but is less often exposed to long periods of rain during the spring growth period. The most damaging stem disease of Douglas-fir is Arceuthobium douglasii. This dwarf mistletoe occurs throughout most of the range of Douglas-fir (26). Over 60 species of insects are indigenous to Douglas-fir cones, but only a few species damage a significant proportion of the seed crop. Damage by insects is frequently more pronounced during the years of light or medium seed crops that may follow good or heavy crops. The most destructive insects include: (a) the Douglas-fir seed chalcid (Megastigmus spermotrophus), which matures in the developing seed and gives no external sign of its presence; (b) the Douglas-fir cone moth (Barbara colfaxiana) and the fir cone worm (Dioryctria abietivorella) whose larvae bore indiscriminately through the developing cones and may leave external particles of frass; and (c) the Douglas-fir cone gall midge (Contarinia oregonensis) and cone scale midge (C. washingtonensis), which destroy some seed but prevent harvest of many more by causing galls that prevent normal opening of cones. The Douglas-fir cone moth is perhaps a more serious pest in the drier, interior portions of the Douglas-fir range and the Contarinia spp. in the wetter regions. Any of these insects, however, may effectively destroy a cone crop in a given location (27). Insects are generally not a severe problem for Douglas-fir regeneration, although both the strawberry root weevil (Otiorhynchus oratus) and cranberry girdler (Chrysoteuchia topiaria) may cause significant damage to seedlings in nurseries; damage to plantations by rain beetles (Pleocoma spp.) and weevils (Steremnius carinatus)- the latter particularly damaging to container-grown-plants-has been reported. The Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata) and the western spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) are the most important insect enemies of Douglas-fir. Both insects attack trees of all ages at periodic intervals throughout the range of interior Douglas-fir, often resulting in severe defoliation of stands. The Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) is a destructive insect pest in old-growth stands of coastal and interior Douglas-fir. Its impact is diminishing, however, with the change to second-growth management and rotations of less than 100 years (24). Consumption of Douglas-fir seeds by small forest mammals such as white-footed deer mice, creeping voles, chipmunks, and shrews, and birds such as juncos, varied thrush, blue and ruffed grouse, and song sparrows further reduces seed quantity. A single deer mouse may devour 350 Douglas-fir seeds in a single night. Mouse populations of 7 to 12/ha (3 to 5/acre) are not uncommon. Most seedfall occurs at least 150 days before the germination period, so this single rodent species has the capacity to destroy the great majority of natural seedfall. Spot seeding studies in the Western United States have clearly demonstrated that forest mammals destroy virtually all unprotected seed. Browsing and clipping by hares, brush rabbits, mountain beaver, pocket gophers, deer, and elk often injure seedlings and saplings. Recent reports have indicated that such damage in western Oregon and Washington may strongly affect seedling survival in many plantations (7,61). In drier areas, domestic livestock have caused considerable damage to variety glauca plantations by grazing and trampling seedlings. In pole-sized timber, bears sometimes deform and even kill young trees by stripping off the bark and cambium. High winds following heavy rains occasionally cause heavy losses from blowdown in the Pacific Northwest. Heavy snow and ice storms periodically break the tops of scattered trees in dense young stands. Crown fires, when they occur, destroy stands of all ages. The thick bark of older Douglas-firs, however, makes them fairly resistant to ground fires.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,14,1
"The variety menziesii of Douglas-fir reaches its best growth on well-aerated, deep soils with a pH range from 5 to 6. It will not thrive on poorly drained or compacted soils. Soils in the coastal belt of northern California, Oregon, and Washington originated chiefly from marine sandstones and shales with scattered igneous intrusions. These rocks have weathered deeply to fine-textured, well-drained soils under the mild, humid climate of the coast. Surface soils are generally acid, high in organic matter and total nitrogen, and low in base saturation. Soils in the Puget Sound area and in southwestern British Columbia are almost entirely of glacial origin. Soils farther inland within the range of the variety menziesii are derived from a wide variety of parent materials. These include metamorphosed sedimentary material in the northern Cascades and igneous rocks and formations of volcanic origin in the southern Cascades. Depth of soils ranges from very shallow on steep slopes and ridgetops to deep in deposits of volcanic origin and residual and colluvial materials. Texture varies from gravelly sands to clays. Surface soils are in general moderately acid. Their organic matter content varies from moderate in the Cascade Range to high in portions of the Coast Range and Olympic Peninsula. Total nitrogen content varies considerably but is usually low in soils of glacial origin. Great soil groups characteristic of the range of coastal Douglas-fir include Haplohumults (Reddish Brown Lateritics) of the order Ultisols, Dystrochrepts (Brown Lateritics), Haplumbrepts (Sols Bruns Acides) of the order Inceptisols, Haplorthods (Western Brown Forest soils) of the order Spodosols, Xerumbrepts (Brown Podzolic soils), and Vitrandepts (Regosols) (63). Soils within the range of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir originated also from a considerable array of parent materials. In south-central British Columbia, eastern Washington, and northern Idaho, soils vary from basaltic talus to deep loess with volcanic ash to thin residual soil over granitic or sedimentary rocks. They are mostly Vitrandepts and Xerochrepts. Parent materials in Montana and Wyoming consist of both igneous and sedimentary rocks, and locally of glacial moraines. Soils derived from noncalcareous substrates are variable in texture but consistently gravelly and acidic. A significant portion of the sedimentary rocks is limestone, which gives rise to neutral or alkaline soils ranging in texture from gravelly loams to gravelly silts. Limestones often weather into soils that are excessively well drained. Soils are Cryoboralfs of the order Alfisols, and Cryandepts and Cryochrepts of the order Inceptisols. Soils in the central and southern Rocky Mountains are very complex. They developed from glacial deposits, crystalline granitic rocks, conglomerates, sandstones, and, in the Southwest, limestones. These soils are Alfisols (Gray Wooded soils), Mollisols (Brown Forest soils), Spodosols (Brown Podzolic soils, Podzols), and Entisols (2,46). Altitudinal distribution of both varieties of Douglas-fir (menziesii and glauca) increases from north to south, reflecting the effect of climate on distribution of the species. The principal limiting factors are temperature in the north of the range and moisture in the south. Consequently, Douglas-fir is found mainly on southerly slopes in the northern part of its range, and on northerly exposures in the southern part. At high elevations in the southern Rocky Mountains, however, Douglas-fir grows on the sunny slopes and dry rock exposures (56). Generally, the variety glauca grows at considerably higher altitudes than the coastal variety of comparable latitude. Altitudinal limit for Douglas-fir in central British Columbia is about 760 m (2,500 ft) but rises to 1250 m (4,100 ft) on Vancouver Island. In Washington and Oregon, the species generally occurs from sea level to 1520 m (5,000 ft), although locally it may occur higher. In the southern Oregon Cascades and in the Sierra Nevada, the altitudinal range is between 610 and 1830 m (2,000 and 6,000 ft). In river valleys and canyon bottoms, the species may occasionally occur at elevations of 240 to 270 m (800 to 900 ft). Near the southern limit of its range in the Sierra Nevada, the species grows to elevations of 2300 m (7,500 ft). The inland variety grows at elevations from 550 to 2440 m (1,800 to 8,000 ft) in the northern part of its range. In the central Rocky Mountains, Douglas-fir grows mostly at elevations between 1830 and 2590 m (6,000 and 8,000 ft), and in the southern Rocky Mountains, between 2440 and 2900 m (8,000 and 9,500 ft). In some localities in southern and central Arizona, Douglas-fir may be found as low as 1550 m (5,100 ft) in canyon bottoms. The highest elevation at which Douglas-fir grows in the Rocky Mountains is 3260 m (10,700 ft) on the crest of Mount Graham in southeastern Arizona.",Soils and Topography,Douglas-Fir,pseudotsuga,menziesii,conifer,15,1
"Douglas-fir is grown as a Christmas tree on rotations ranging from 4 to 7 years. Trees are sheared each year to obtain a pyramid-shaped crown. Attempts to grow Douglas-fir as a Christmas tree in North America outside its native range have failed.

"Eastern cottonwood is the key species in the forest cover type Cottonwood (Society of American Foresters Type 63) and is an associate in the following types (6): Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39), Bur Oak (Type 42), River Birch- Sycamore (Type 61), Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62), Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Type 92), Sycamore-Sweetgum-American Elm (Type 94), and Black Willow (Type 95).

"In various parts of its range, eastern cottonwood is subjected to temperatures as high as 46° C (115° F) and as low as -45° C (-50° F). Average January temperatures vary from -10° C (14° F) to 8° C (46° F). It occurs in areas with from less than 100 to more than 200 consecutive frost-free days per year. Rainfall ranges from less than 380 mm (15 in) in the northwest corner of the range to more than 1400 mm (55 in) in the southern part of the range. In the dryest parts of its range, eastern cottonwood receives most of its moisture from streams, making rainfall requirements meaningless.

"The climate of the Great -Plains, the region in which plains cottonwood grows, is distinctly continental. The region is characterized as dry subhumid to semiarid, with extremes and rapid fluctuations in temperature, unpredictable and limited precipitation, frequent and cyclic droughts, and strong persistent winds (3). Average annual precipitation varies from about 250 mm (10 in) in the northern and western Great Plains to about 760 mm (30 in) in the extreme southeastern part of the species range. About 75 percent of the annual precipitation occurs during the growing season. Drought periods of 35 to 60 consecutive days may be expected annually, and periods of 60 to 70 days without rainfall may occur once in 10 years. Infrequent drought periods of 90 to 120 days have been recorded in the northern and southern plains, respectively. Drought hazard is greatest in the autumn and winter in the northern plains, and in the winter in the southern Great Plains where snowfall is less. High-velocity winds occur in all seasons but are strongest and most persistent during winter and early spring (29). Average January temperatures vary from -15° C (5° F) in the North to 4° C (40° F) in the South.

"The eastern members of plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides var. occidentalis) intergrade with western-most eastern cottonwoods (P. deltoides var. deltoides); therefore, the literature reveals no named hybrids between these very closely related populations (14). Interspecific hybrids have been reported, however, between plains cottonwood and named species to the north and west. In southern Alberta, Canada, plains cottonwood is reported to cross and introgress readily with balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), narrowleaf cottonwood (P angustifolia James), and possibly quaking aspen (P tremuloides Michx.) (4). Lanceleaf cottonwood (P. x acuminata Rydb.) is regarded as an interspecific hybrid between narrowleaf cottonwood (P. angustifolia James), which occurs from northern New Mexico, Nebraska, and North Dakota to southern Alberta, and plains cottonwood (P deltoides var. occidentalis) (14).

"Within the large and climatically diverse north-south range of plains cottonwood, subtle but recognizable differences in the population have evolved by natural selection. What is here called Populus deltoides var. occidentalis has received at least nine names denoting either specific or varietal rank over the past two centuries (14). Recently, the eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) complex has been treated as a group of three intergrading subspecies showing random or clinal variation or both within each subspecies (7). Plains cottonwood, on the basis of taxonomic affinities to the poplars of the Great Lakes region, was recognized as P. deltoides ssp. monilifera (Ait.) Eckenwalder. This treatment, supported by recent provenance evaluations in Nebraska, seems to be a more tenable interpretation. In these provenance evaluations the poplars of Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, with smooth bark, small branches, small leaves with a few or no glands and few serrations, and prolific rooting habit tended to be similar to poplars of Minnesota. and Wisconsin origin (32).",Hybrids,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,9,0

This range spans approximately 20° in longitude (92° to 115° W.) and 25° in latitude (30° to 55° N.) (14,19). Specifically, plains cottonwood grows from southern Alberta, central Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba in Canada, south through the Great Plains in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, western Oklahoma into northcentral Texas and extreme northeastern New Mexico; north in Colorado, eastern Wyoming, and eastern Montana.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Eastern cotton wood is dioecious. The sex ratio is about 1 to 1 (8). Floral buds form in the summer prior to opening the next spring. Male buds develop somewhat earlier than female buds and are much larger. Flowering occurs from February to April before leaves appear. Male flowers are only 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 in) long. They have 40 to 60 stamens and are reddish in color and more conspicuous than the female flowers. Female flowers elongate to 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in). Males tend to flower a few days earlier than females. Flowering varies by as much as a month among trees in a stand (9). As a result, early-flowering trees do not have the opportunity to cross with late-flowering trees. Trees as young as 4 to 5 years old have flowered. Northern trees flower at lower temperatures than do southern trees. Seeds develop 30 to 60 per capsule on short stalks on long catkins. Each capsule has 3 or 4 valves. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production starts when the trees are 5 to 10 years old, increasing rapidly in amount as the trees become older and larger. Estimates of annual seed production of a single open-grown tree have been as high as 48 million seeds (3). Good seed crops are the rule. About 35 liters (I bushel) of fresh fruit yields 1 kg (2.2 lb) of seeds, or about 770,000 cleaned seeds (19). Seed dispersal follows flowering by about 2 months in southern populations and a somewhat shorter period in the North. It is characterized by considerable variation among trees as well as a lengthy dispersal period for some individual trees (9). Seed dispersal occurs from May through mid-July in the South and June through mid-July in the North (19). The dispersal pattern results in abundant deposits of seeds along water courses as spring flood waters recede. Seeds may be carried several hundred feet by the wind, aided by the ""cotton"" attached to the seed. Seeds falling in water may be carried a long distance from the parent tree before being left on silt deposits. Seedling Development- Unless floating on or immersed in water, cottonwood seeds must reach a favorable seedbed and germinate very soon after falling. Germination of fresh seeds may exceed 90 percent. Seedlings are delicate for the first few weeks. Rains, very hot sunshine, and damping-off fungi kill many of them. Very moist, exposed mineral soils, such as fresh silt deposits, are required. Germination is epigeal. Growth rate of the fragile seedlings is slow for the first 3 weeks but may be very rapid after that. Full sunlight for a substantial part of each day is required after the first few weeks. Fully mature seeds that are dried promptly to 5 to 8 percent moisture and stored at temperatures just above freezing maintain viability for several months. Storage at -20° C (-4° F) may prolong viability for 5 or more years (20). It is best to increase the moisture content gradually when attempting to germinate very dry seed. Vegetative Reproduction- Satisfactory sprouting has occurred on low-cut stumps of trees as old as 25 years of age (22). Reproduction by root suckers is not common. Artificial propagation of the species normally involves use of cuttings from 1-year stem growth from nursery trees (23). These may or may not be rooted before outplanting. The planting season in the North is short, coinciding with the beginning of the growing season. Rooted cuttings commonly are used under these conditions. In the Southern United States, unrooted cuttings 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 in ) long provide a satisfactory, economical means of planting (15). Survival rates of 70 to 90 percent are normally achieved, depending on the genetics of the clones, quality of cuttings, and field conditions. Root-inducing hormones normally are not used. Rooted or unrooted long cuttings are sometimes used to reach moisture, to reduce damage from deer, to permit less intensive site preparation and to provide greater flood tolerance. Because operational use of asexual propagation of cottonwood permits immediate and complete utilization of superior genotypes, rooting ability is of great importance. Propagation from 1-year-old wood from older trees is often difficult, but some success is usually achieved. Repropagation from the resulting material is often satisfactory. Clones tracing back to older trees normally have the smooth, somewhat thin, bark characteristics of the tops of older trees.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,13,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Plains cottonwood's dioecious with only occasional deviations. Staminate and pistillate flowers are borne on twigs of the previous year's growth, appearing in early spring (April and May) before the leaves develop (20,27). Pollination is by wind. Following anthesis, the staminate catkins dry and fall within 2 weeks. Four to 6 weeks, ranging from June through August, are required for seed maturation (9,20). The flowering period seems to be regular within the limits of geographic zones, but differences can occur in time of anthesis between stands and among trees within stands. Differences in date of flowering from year to year apparently depend upon temperatures. The ratio of staminate to ovulate trees is believed to be about 1 to 1. In the lower Mississippi Valley the ratio was reported to be 54 to 46 percent (10). Seed Production and Dissemination- Minimum seed-bearing age of plains cottonwood is about 10 years, and fair to large seed crops can be expected annually. The seeds are very small, yet relatively large for the genus; they range from 551,000 to 1,056,000 seeds per kilogram (250,000 to 479,000 lb). Seeds have a tuft of ""cottonlike"" hairs attached and are dispersed primarily by wind, but also by water, over long distances a few days after ripening. Seedfall among trees within a locality varies greatly and may extend for 6 weeks or longer (9,20). Seedling Development- The viability of fresh seeds is high; 98 percent germination has been attained during the first 5 days following dispersal (9,20). Longevity of poplar seeds under natural conditions has been reported to be 2 weeks to 1 month. Vitality of fresh, unstored seed drops rapidly, however, if they are not kept moist. There is no evident dormancy. Poplar seeds can be stored successfully and viability is prolonged if the moisture content is reduced to 4 or 5 percent. Air-dried P. deltoides seeds, stored in sealed containers at 1° to 4° C (34° to 39° F), were 100 percent viable after 6 months (9,20). Seeds of some poplar species have been similarly stored in vacuum-packed jars at 0° C (32° F) for as long as 3 years (11). Recently, it was demonstrated that P. deltoides seed stored at -20° C (- 4° F), either at normal air pressure or under vacuum, showed significantly higher germination than the same seed stored at 5° C (41° F) under vacuum (in sealed containers), after 6 months of storage. Thereafter, germination at -20° C (-4° F) remained unchanged during a 6-year study period, whereas germination of seed stored at 5° C (41° F) was considered unsatisfactory after 3.5 years. Eastern cottonwood seed should always be stored at below freezing temperature, even for short-term storage (28). Germination is epigeal. Plains cottonwood seed germinates within 48 hours after dispersal on proven mediums such as moist silt, sand, or fine gravel in full sunlight. The aboveground portion of the seedling develops rapidly and vigorously. Constant moisture is required for at least several weeks to ensure the establishment and survival of the slower developing root systems of the seedlings (5,9). The best planting sites are moderately welldrained, permeable, and fertile deep loam soils on bottom lands. Very sandy soil is suitable if the water table is within 3.7 to 4.6 rn (12 to 15 ft) of the surface. Even upland sites are satisfactory if they are fertile, not too shallow, and if rainfall is abundant and well-distributed. Full sunlight, freedom from competition of weeds and grass (particularly sod), and abundant moisture throughout at least the first growing season are essential to seedling survival and establishment (27). Although initial establishment is usually good and growth is rapid on coarse sands and gravels of river bottom lands, periods of drought and fluctuating water tables make subsequent development uncertain (17). Establishment of plains cottonwood on meander lobes of rivers in southern Canada is positively correlated with flood flows during seed dispersal (June 1-July 10) (2). Floods during the seed-dispersal period recur in southern Alberta and northern Montana about every 5 years. Vegetative Reproduction- Plains cottonwood is easily reproduced by stem cuttings from 1-year-old ""ripened"" wood. Since this species, like other members of the genus, sprouts vigorously from both roots and stumps of young trees, clonal ""stool"" beds are commonly established for the production of these cuttings. Cuttings can also be taken from pollards, 1-year-old plants, or epicormic branches of old plants (11). Healthy, straight, lignified wands without bark injuries approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) long and 3 to 30 mm (0.1 to 1.2 in) in diameter are cut from stool beds with a sharp knife during the dormant season (October to March), treated with fungicide, and placed in cool 50 C (410 F), moist storage (11). The wands are divided into cuttings approximately 25.4 cm (10 in) long and 10 to 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 in) in diameter at midpoint and inserted in a mist-sprayed greenhouse rooting bench containing moist sand as a medium. Recent greenhouse and field tests in Nebraska demonstrated that cuttings taken from the basal end of wands produce significantly more roots than those taken from the upper portion. Also, cuttings from clones of Nebraska and Minnesota-Wisconsin origins produced significantly higher numbers of roots than those of other geographic sources (33). About 4 to 6 weeks are required for rooting and subsequent field establishment. Rooted cuttings of R deltoides are not root-pruned when field-planted. Unrooted cuttings can also be field-planted. In wetter climates and in heavier soils, 25.4 cm (10 in) cuttings are satisfactory. In drier climates and in sandy soils, cuttings 50 to 80 cm (20 to 31 in) long have been more successful. In both situations, dormant cuttings are planted in the early spring and are completely buried except for the top bud and 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) of the wand. Difficult-to-root clones can also be grafted (11). Experiments in Utah have shown that Populus deltoides (of unknown, but presumed eastern origin), R balsamifera, and R angustifolia, as well as R tremuloides, produce abundant shoots (suckers) and roots from root cuttings (segments). New shoots and roots originate from pre-existing suppressed buds embedded in the periderm along the surface of the root cutting and from the region of the exposed cambium at the cut ends. The presence of lateral root increased shoot growth, and the development of shoots and lateral roots responded to the inherent polarity of the root segments (18). The probability that the closely related plains cottonwood will react similarly would seem to be high.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Eastern cottonwood is one of the tallest species east of the Rocky Mountains. Heights of 53 to 58 in (175 to 190 ft) and diameters of 120 to 180 cm (48 to 72 in) have been reported (17), as have age 35 stand volumes exceeding 420.0 m³/ha (30,000 fbm/acre) of sawed lumber (5,10,14,22). The most phenomenal growth has been from trees planted on favorable sites in the South and receiving adequate weed control. Scientists have recorded heights of 13 in (43 ft) at age 3 and more than 30 in (100 ft) at age 9 on individual trees. In one plantation, unpruned trees at wide spacing averaged 29 cm (11.4 in) d.b.h. at age 5 (11). The best yields with close spacing of unimproved clones without irrigation in the South has been about 138.6 m³/ha (1,980 ft³/acre) total volume at age 4 with 2,700 stems per hectare (1,100/acre) (21). Rooting Habit- Root growth of new seedlings is so slow that the plants are easily dislodged by rain droplets. After the first 3 weeks, root growth accelerates and lateral root growth may exceed height growth for the first year. Most of the roots are in the uppermost, best aerated layer of soil (2). They are nearer the surface in clay soils than in loam soils. Following siltation, roots develop on the covered portion of the stem. Cottonwood trees planted from conventional 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24 in) cuttings have fewer deep roots and are not as well anchored against root lodging as those established naturally or as deep-planted seedlings or rooted cuttings. Reaction to Competition- Cottonwood is classed as very intolerant of shade. It is more intolerant of shade than any of its associates except willow. Although the two frequently seed in together, pure stands of one or the other are the general rule after the first few years. Willow survives on the wetter sites and cottonwood on the slightly higher, drier sites. Its faster growth allows cottonwood to crowd out the willow except where prolonged deep flooding drowns the cottonwood component of the stand. Cottonwood responds poorly to release following crowding. Only those trees with the best crowns respond. In natural stands, uneven spacing and size permit some trees to become dominant, and natural thinning allows production of large trees. Under plantation conditions and particularly when only clones with similar growth rates are used and all trees get off to a good start, stagnation can occur quickly. Spacing and timing of thinning become critical under these conditions. Optimum growth of individual trees requires very wide, seemingly wasteful, spacing. On the best sites in the South, cottonwood planted initially at a spacing of 3.7 by 3.7 m (12 by 12 ft) should be thinned by removing half of the trees at age 3 and again at age 5 if rapid growth rate of individual trees is to be maintained. Damaging Agents- Although cottonwood grows rapidly under ideal conditions, numerous agents can disrupt its schedule and cause death or loss in tree quality or growth rate. These include insects, disease organisms, flood, fire, and various animals. At least 10 insect species and 12 diseases cause major damage to eastern cottonwood throughout its range (16). A clearwing borer, Paranthrene dollii dollii, attacks the lower stem. Another clearwing borer, P. tabaniformis, attacks terminals and small branches causing breakage of terminals. The poplar borer, Saperda calcarata, attacks trunks of trees 3 or more years old and may riddle portions of the trunks with tunnels, causing serious degrade or breakage. The cottonwood borer, Plectrodera scalator, attacks the root collar and roots of both large and small trees. Small, closely-spaced trees break off easily from this damage. The cottonwood twig borer, Gypsonoma haimbachiana, causes stunting, forking, and other malformations in young cottonwood. The cottonwood leaf beetle, Chrysomela scripta, defoliates and kills terminals, producing forked stems. The poplar tentmaker, Ichthyura inclusa, can cause repeated defoliation, resulting in mortality. Numerous disease organisms attack cottonwood. Septoria musiva causes a small canker that opens a path for other canker organisms. Cytospora chrysosperma causes a canker where sites are adverse and tree vigor is low. Fusarium solani enters wounds, particularly after major floods, to cause a canker. Two other canker-producing organisms are Phomopsis macrospora and Botryodiplodia theobromae. On vigorous trees, cankers usually callus over. Melampsora medusae causes leaf rust which results in premature defoliation and reduced growth rate. Marssonina brunnea causes a leaf spot that also results in early defoliation. Septoria musiva, in addition to causing a canker, causes a leaf spot. New leaves may be infected from old leaves or cankers. Since cottonwood grows primarily in relatively low areas near streams it is subjected to frequent flooding. Floods during the dormant season or floods of short duration during the growing season may benefit cottonwood trees by fully recharging subsoil moisture and providing some degree of vegetation control. Floods that overtop newly sprouting cuttings or established trees for prolonged periods during the growing season or that result in stagnant water pools are harmful. Cottonwood of all ages is very susceptible to fire. A very light burn kills younger trees, while burns of greater intensity kill or wound larger ones. Butt rot, a common result of fire injury, is uncommon in cottonwood, however (13). Seedlings and young trees are browsed by rabbits deer, and domestic stock. A substantial portion of the trees can recover from this damage. Beavers cut sapling and pole-size trees for food and for dam construction. The resulting ponds may drown cottonwood trees.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,14,0
"Growth and Yield- Young plains cottonwood trees grow 1.8 to 3.7 m (6 to 12 ft) per year in height under favorable conditions, surpassing other native species of the Great Plains region in height and diameter growth. Growth is most rapid in the first 25 to 30 years, by which time the trees can reach 15.2 to 22.9 m (50 to 75 ft) in height and 61.0 to 91.4 cm (24 to 36 in) in diameter. Cottonwood sources from Missouri (P. deltoides) and Nebraska (Sioux-land), along with silver maple (Acer saccharinum), ranked highest among seven species tested for the production of biomass during a 2-year study in Kansas (12). Plains cottonwood usually attains maximum development in about 40 to 50 years. Mature trees can be 24.4 to 27.4 m (80 to 90 ft) tall, with diameters of 1.8 to 2.4 m (6 to 8 ft), and with clear holes for 9.1 m (30 ft) or more. The trees are usually single-stemmed with an open, spreading, symmetrical crown of massive horizontal branches and stout, more or less angled branchlets and twigs. While plains cottonwood is relatively short-lived, it can remain vigorous for 80 to 90 years under favorable conditions (21,27). Survival and growth of cottonwoods on the Great Plains is directly dependent upon availability of moisture. Mortality during the drought of the mid-1930's was 59 percent along intermittent streams, 55 percent near springs that failed during the drought, and only 6 percent along continuously flowing streams (1). Fully stocked cottonwood stands along creek and river channels and overflow land in Kansas are estimated to yield 168.0 to 210.0 m³/ha (12,000 to 15,000 fbm/acre) at 25 to 30 years of age (21). In North Dakota, 30-and 50-year-old plantation yields were 59.5 to 219.8 m³/ha (4,250 and 17,500 fbm/acre) gross merchantable volume, respectively, Scribner log rule (26). Plains cottonwood 94 cm (37 in) in diameter outside bark and 19.8 to 22.9 m (65 to 75 ft) tall, growing in the South Platte River bottom, Morgan County in eastern Colorado, attained gross volumes of 8.0 m³ (283 ft³) inside bark (8). One could expect trees growing on more fertile and wetter sites along the Platte and Missouri River bottom lands in the eastern part of the range to achieve volumes in the magnitude of 11.3 m³ (400 ft³). Rooting Habit- Early diameter and height growth of plains cottonwood surpasses that of other species native to the Great Plains region (17). Growth and penetration of poplar seedling roots immediately following germination is reported to be relatively slow, however. About 5 days are required after germination for the primary root to begin downward growth, and after 12 days the root may be only 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long (19). Growth continues slowly for 3 weeks to 1 month, at which time taproots of the cultivar Petrowskyana, for example, grown indoors in fairly strong light, averaged only 2.5 cm Q in) in length at the end of I month. This growth pattern explains the critical need for continuous moisture during the seedling stage. Subsequent root growth is much more rapid. Ninety-eight percent of the roots of a 43-year-old northern cottonwood (Populus monilifera), 19.8 m (65 ft) tall, were found to be in the top 1.2 m (4 ft) of a prairie clay soil near Fargo, ND (31). Roots of this and other non-drought-tolerant species formed shallow roots on dry sandy sites but had a tendency to grow deep vertical roots on very moist (nonsaturated) sandy sites. Similar trends of root development were revealed in excavations of plains cottonwood trees growing in silty loam soils in eastern Nebraska, where (1) a 14-year-old tree, 18.3 m (60 ft) tall, developed only shallow, widespread, and fibrous roots over and down to a water table 0.8 m (2.5 ft) deep; (2) a 16-year-old tree, 11.3 m (37 ft) tall, developed a moderately heavy root system downward to a water table 4.3 m (14 ft) deep and then branched outward; and (3) a 49-year-old tree, 21.3 m (70 ft) tall, developed a distinct and heavy taprooted pattern over an unreachable water table 18.3 m (60 ft) deep (24). Reaction to Competition- Plains cottonwood requires full sunlight for maximum growth. It is classed as very intolerant of shade and intolerant of root competition (21). It grows either in pure stands, which thin naturally and rapidly, or in open mixed stands, both of which are nearly always even-aged (17). After pioneering on alluvial sites, often with the willows, it is gradually replaced with other broadleaf species that can then become established under the forest conditions so created. Cottonwood does not normally regenerate until the overstory has broken up. Damaging Agents- Prolonged periods of severe environmental stress, such as drought, weaken trees physiologically and increase their susceptibility to disease and insect pathogens. Plains cottonwood, with its high water requirement is especially vulnerable (1). P. deltoides var. occidentalis trees, considered water-tolerant, showed 47 percent high stress rate and 18 percent mortality when inundated late in the growing season in the Central Plains (15). Leaf rusts and stem cankers are the most widespread and damaging diseases. Leaf rusts cause premature defoliation of trees. This defoliation not only causes growth losses; it weakens the trees and increases their susceptibility to infection by other pathogens, which cause cankers and mortality. Melampsora leaf rust caused by Melampsora medusae is one of the most serious leaf diseases of plains cottonwood. Others include Septoria leaf spot, caused by Septoria musiva, Marssonina brunnea leaf spot, and Alternaria leaf and stem blight, caused by Alternaria tenuis (16). The most serious of the canker pathogens is Cytospora canker (Cytospora chrysosperma), which often results in wind-breakage at the wound area. Other canker pathogens include those caused by Septoria musiva, Fusarium solani, Phomopsis macrospora, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Cryptosphaeria populina, and Pleurotus ostreatus. Root and butt rots may be due to Ganoderma lucidum, Armillaria tabescens, and Scytinostroma galactinium (16). The insects most damaging to plains cottonwood are the defoliators and wood borers; the former cause loss of vigor, the latter reduce the quality of lumber. Some of the more important defoliating insects include the cottonwood leaf beetle (Chrysomela scripta), cottonwood dagger moth (Acronicta lepusculina), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), poplar leaffolding sawfly (Phyllocolpa bozemani), fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), and the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) (25). Important boring insects include the poplar borer (Saperda calcarata), cottonwood borer (Plectrodera scalator), flatheaded wood borer (Dicerca divaricata), carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), poplar-and-willow borer (Cryptorhynchus lapathi), and the bronze poplar borer (Agrilus liragus) (25). Several species of mites and aphids infest plains cottonwood, but their effects are not usually fatal.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,14,0
"The species survives on deep, infertile sands and clays but makes its best growth on moist, welldrained, fine sandy or silt loams close to streams. The soils of most cottonwood sites are in the soil orders Entisols and Inceptisols. The best sites are characterized by absence of mottles in the upper 46 cm (18 in), water tables from 60 to 180 cm (24 to 72 in), bulk density of less than 1.4 g/cm³ (0.8 oz/in³), pH of 5.5 to 7.5, and greater than 2 percent organic matter (1). Sites frequently meet the requirements for good growth, but because of competition or lack of proper seeding conditions, planting is necessary for stand establishment. Eastern cottonwood is not often found as a well-formed tree at an elevation of more than 4.6 to 6.1 m (15 to 20 ft) above the average level of streams. In the lower Mississippi River Valley, the best sites are in the batture, the land between the levees and the river. Here the species grows on the front land ridges, the high land or banks of present or former stream courses, on well-drained flats, the general terrain between low ridges, and rarely on abandoned fields on well-drained ridges in the first bottoms (17). Where it occurs on slopes, it is confined to the lower ones that remain moist throughout the growing season. An example is the brown loam bluff area of loessial soil along the eastern side of the lower Mississippi River flood plain. Fine cottonwood specimens are frequent in the bottoms and on the lowest slopes bordering the small water-courses emerging from the bluffs.",Soils and Topography,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,15,0
"Plains cottonwood grows along most of the rivers and streams that flow through the loessial soils of the Great Plains on sites that are 2.4 to 3.7 m (8 to 12 ft) above the water table. The taxon predominates on the level, narrow stringers of the river floodplains and stream bottom lands that cross the region. It is common in pure stands on river sandbars and on overflow land in the bends of large rivers but is also found in the beds of intermittent streams (1). Plains cottonwood grows on soils of the order Entisols, mainly along alluvial streams, and on soils of the orders Mollisols, Alfisols, and Inceptisols on stream terraces, in drainage ways, and in bottom lands and subirrigated valleys. Best development is on deep, rich, well-drained loams; however, the species also grows on level subirrigated uplands of deep, sandy soils (1). Soil texture and fertility seem to be of lesser importance than moisture, however, in determining its occurrence. Plains cottonwood grows between elevations of about 300 m (1,000 ft) near its eastern limit to about 1830 m (6,000 ft) in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. It is seldom found above 2130 m (7,000 ft) (27).",Soils and Topography,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,15,0
"Eastern cottonwood is frequently planted to give quick shade near homes. Male clones, which have none of the objectionable ""cotton"" associated with seed, are preferred. Windbreaks are occasionally established with cottonwood as a component. Cottonwood is suitable for soil stabilization where soil and moisture conditions are adequate, as along stream or ditch banks. Deep planting permits reforesting of nonproductive fields with sandy soils having available moisture beneath a dry surface layer. There has been considerable interest in cottonwood for energy biomass, because of its high yield potential and coppicing ability. There has also been interest in growing it for inclusion in cattle feed, since it is a good source of cellulose relatively free of undesirable components, such as tannins. The new growth is high in protein and minerals.",Special Uses,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,16,0
"Plains cottonwood is an important component of windbreak plantings in the Great Plains. It is frequently used as an ornamental to provide quick, if rather temporary, esthetic and protective effects. Plains cottonwood can produce an effective windbarrier 12.2 to 15.2 in (40 to 50 ft) tall in 15 to 20 years on stream lowlands and on deep, sandy, subirrigated lands (17). The wood of plains cottonwood is coarse, odorless, soft, and lightweight, yet relatively strong. The heartwood is pale yellowish brown, the sapwood nearly white. The wood frequently warps on drying and is not durable in contact with soil and other moist conditions. It nails without splitting, is clean appearing, and takes printing and stenciling well. The wood is used primarily for pallets, rough construction lumber (farm buildings), interior parts of furniture, excelsior, crating, and wood pulp (21,27). The pulp produces a very high-grade gloss paper. New and potentially important commercial uses of the wood include roughage food for livestock and the production of fiber and reconstituted wood products derived from short-rotation (2- to 8-year) biomass operations (6,23).",Special Uses,Eastern Cottonwood,populus,deltoides,hardwood,16,0
"Eastern hemlock is a major component of four forest cover types (9): In the Northern Forest Region, White Pine-Hemlock (Society of American Foresters Type 22), Eastern Hemlock (Type 23), and Hemlock-Yellow Birch (Type 24); in the Central Forest Region, Yellow-Poplar-Eastern Hemlock (Type 58). It is also a common associate in seven types of the Northern Forest Region: White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple (Type 20), Eastern White Pine (Type 21), Red Spruce-Yellow Birch (Type 30), Red Spruce-Sugar Maple-Beech (Type 31), Red Spruce (Type 32), Red Spruce-Balsam Fir (Type 33), Red Spruce-Fraser Fir (Type 34). Eastern hemlock occurs in the following 18 types but only as a minor species: 5 Balsam Fir 17 Pin Cherry 18 Paper Birch 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 26 Sugar Maple-Basswood 27 Sugar Maple 28 Black Cherry-Maple 35 Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 37 Northern White-Cedar 39 Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple 44 Chestnut Oak 52 White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak 53 White Oak 57 Yellow-Poplar 59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak 60 Beech-Sugar Maple 97 Atlantic White-Cedar 108 Red Maple Fully stocked stands of eastern hemlock form such a dense canopy that an understory seldom is able to develop. When an understory does exist, the most common herbs are false lily-of-the-valley (Mianthemum canadense), starflower (Trientalis borealis), woodfern (Dryopteris spp.), common woodsorrel (Oxalis montana), goldthread (Coptis groenlandica), clubmoss (Lycopodium spp.), and sedges (Carex spp.). Common mosses are Dicranum and Polytrichum (30,39).",Associated Forest Cover,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,1,1
"Eastern hemlock is generally restricted to regions with cool humid climates. In the northern areas January temperatures average about -12° C (10° F) and July temperatures about 16° C (60° F). Precipitation ranges from less than 740 mm. (29 in) in heavy snowfall areas of the north to more than 1270 mm (50 in) per year, about one-half occurring as summer precipitation. In the more productive areas near the Atlantic coast and southern Appalachians, January temperatures range as high as 6° C (42° F) and annual precipitation exceeds 1520 mm (60 in). The frost-free period is less than 80 days at the northern limits and nearly 200 days in the eastern and southern portions of the range. Fully stocked stands of eastern hemlock tend to develop similar microclimates because of their dense canopy, dense shading, deep duff layer, and subsequent retention of moisture and uniformly low temperatures. In the few stands in which understories do develop, the type of vegetation tends to be similar to other forest types in the area although fewer species become established (30).",Climate,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,2,1
"Seedlings grown from 30 seed sources throughout the range showed a pattern of clinal variation in photoperiodic response. However, many species change abruptly when isolated on the basis of physiographic features (35). Comparison of an outlier source with one from Wisconsin indicated that races of eastern hemlock differ in physiological and morphological characteristics associated with locality (7). No further studies have been reported on the genetics of eastern hemlock and no superior trees have been selected. The primary effort in genetic research is propagation of variants for ornamental purposes. At least 280 clones are recorded as being variants, ranging from prostrate to weeping forms (11).",Genetics,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,7,1
"The northern limit of eastern hemlock extends from outliers in northeastern Minnesota and the western one-third of Wisconsin eastward through northern Michigan, south-central Ontario, extreme southern Quebec, through New Brunswick, and all of Nova Scotia. Within the United States the species is found throughout New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and the middle Atlantic States, extending westward from central New Jersey to the Appalachian Mountains, then southward into northern Georgia and Alabama. Outliers also appear in extreme southern Michigan and western Ohio, with scattered islands in southern Indiana and east of the Appalachians in the middle Atlantic States. The range completely overlaps that of Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana), a closely related species limited to the slopes of the Appalachians from Virginia and West Virginia into Georgia. Commercial volumes of eastern hemlock have been greatly reduced by harvesting. In Michigan, for example, sawtimber volume decreased 69 percent and growing stock volume decreased 71 percent between 1935 and 1955 (10). Both the type area and volume are continuing to decline because of harvesting and failure to regenerate, particularly in the western portion of the range. The remaining sawtimber is concentrated in the Northeast and the Lake States (5). - The native range of eastern hemlock.",Native Range,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowering in eastern hemlock is monoecious with the flowers in separate clusters on the same branch. Beginning about age 15, male strobili arise from short-stalked light-yellow flower clusters in the axis of needles from the preceding year; they are then surrounded by bud scales to form the male conelet. The shorter ovulate flowers develop on the terminals of the previous year's branchlets and develop into erect conelets. Two ovules occur on each of the bracts. The time of flowering ranges from late April to early June, depending on the locality and season. Pollen usually is dispersed by the wind beginning about 2 weeks after leaf buds burst, when the bracts on the female conelet are partially open (28,29,35). At the close of pollination receptivity, the conelets are in a drooping position and the cone scales reclose. Fertilization is complete in about 6 weeks. During this period the pollen is extremely sensitive to drying, often the cause of seed failure (28). Cones reach full size in late August to early September, about the same time as the winter buds begin to form. Cones open fully in mid-October, and seed dispersal extends into the winter. Opened cones may persist on the trees for slightly more than 1 year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Cones of eastern hemlock are the smallest in the genus, from 13 to 19 mm (0.5 to 0.75 in) long; 35.2 liters (1 bushel) of cones weigh about 15.4 kg (34 lb), and yield from 0.64 to 0.68 kg (1.4 to 1.5 lb) of seed. The number of cleaned seeds ranges from 56,250 to 163,290/kg (25,500 to 74,070/1b). Seeds from eastern and southern areas are usually larger than those from northern and western regions. The seeds of eastern hemlock are slightly larger than those of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) but are smaller than those of either Carolina or mountain hemlock (T. mertensiana) (36). The single seeds are about 1.6 mm (0.06 in) long with a slightly longer terminal wing. Seeds ripen about the time the cones change from yellowish green to purple brown. Dispersal of the seeds begins when the cones turn deeper brown indicating a reduction in moisture content. Most seeds fall within tree height because of the small wings. Additional distribution may occur from drifting on crusted snow. Some seeds may remain in the cones through the winter but usually they are sterile, having developed without an embryo (35). In healthy, vigorous seeds, the embryo extends the full length of the seed. Eastern hemlock is one of the most frequent cone producers among the eastern conifers. Good or better cone crops occur 61 percent of the years, based on 32 years of observation in Wisconsin (13,29,37). Successive good or better cone crops did occur for one 5-year period and successive poor cone crops for a maximum of only 2 years. Excellent cone production has been reported for trees more than 450 years of age (35). Seedling Development- Despite the high frequency of cone crops and the long duration of cone production by individual trees, the viability of eastern hemlock seed is usually low. Germinative capacity commonly is less than 25 percent (36). In one locality only 2.1 viable seeds were produced per cone, 2.2 were destroyed by insects, and the remaining 8.0 seeds were empty (29). Eastern hemlock seed is partially dormant at maturity and must be stratified about 10 weeks at or slightly above freezing temperatures for best germination. Unstratified seed must be exposed to light to break the partial dormancy. Under natural conditions the chilling requirements are met during the winter and the spring germination seldom is delayed because of seed dormancy (35). Germination is epigeal. The temperature requirements for germination of eastern hemlock are more exacting than for other species in the genus. A constant temperature of 15° C (59° F) is about optimum for germination. High germination percentages usually occur at temperatures ranging from 7° to 18° C (44° to 64° F), depending on the seed source (29,35). These temperatures are nearly identical to those required for yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), the most common associated species in the northern region, and help to explain the association of two species differing so much in tolerance. Achieving desirable temperatures for germination under natural conditions is difficult because eastern hemlock seeds require from 45 to 60 days to reach their peak in germinative energy. Contrary to common belief, the species requires a warm, moist site for stand establishment rather than the cool, moist conditions that usually develop as stands mature. Eastern hemlock seeds are easily damaged by drying. In one study 60 percent of the seeds were severely damaged after only 2 hours of drying, and 80 percent died or did not recover after 6 hours of drying (35). Drying of the seedling after germination caused heavy root mortality that could not be overcome once moisture conditions improved. Natural stands of eastern hemlock nearly always contain a large component of relatively even-aged trees but consistently have a stocking of older age classes and larger diameter trees that provided shelter during the regeneration period (17,33,35,39). Consequently, new stands of eastern hemlock and yellow birch can be established under a high density overstory (from 70 to 80 percent crown cover) using the shelterwood regeneration system. The site must be prepared, however, by thorough mixing of organic and mineral soil or by prescribed fire to expose a partially decomposed layer (6,12,14,18,26,32,34, 35,38). Under this system, optimum conditions are created for germination and seedling establishment. Without these conditions most eastern hemlock regeneration is restricted to rotten logs, stumps, and mounds that normally have warmer surfaces and better moisture retention than the forest floor. The rigid overstory and seedbed requirements for successful natural regeneration of eastern hemlock were evident in a direct seeding study in northwestern Pennsylvania. ""No hemlock germinated on prepared spots in the open (hemlock rarely germinates and becomes established in open areas) and only a few germinated under a light overstory because of the moisture stress created under these conditions."" Germination was good, however, on prepared sites under a pole-size stand, especially on north slopes (20). Under ideal growing conditions, seedlings of eastern hemlock develop slowly. First-year seedlings may grow only 25 to 38 mm (1 to 1.5 in) in height and the roots extend less than 13 mm (0.5 in) into the soil. These conditions provide moisture in the upper soil horizon throughout the growing season. ""Because of their stable moisture requirements, seedlings are very sensitive to high temperatures and drying of the surface soil during the establishment period. Once the root system has reached a soil depth not radically affected by surface drying, usually after the second year, the seedlings grow more rapidly without interference of overhead shade. Seedlings are fully established when they are 0.9 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft) tall and at that time, can be released completely from overhead competition without fear of mortality."" Eastern hemlock seedlings are subject to damping-off as well as root rot fungi (23,35). The fungi may be present in the soil or within the seed before it is dispersed. At least seven species of fungi are known to attack the seed, and several other species cause damping-off. Treatment of seeds with fungicides is frequently ineffective in controlling diseases and also delays or reduces germination. The high incidence of seedling disease combined with low seed viability suggest that supplemental seeding would enhance natural seeding under most conditions. Vegetative Reproduction- None of the hemlocks sprout and only rarely layer. Vegetative propagation by cuttings and grafting are limited to ornamental production (35). Stem cuttings are easily rooted but auxin treatments will enhance the response under greenhouse conditions. Natural root grafts have been reported in northern Wisconsin. Most of the stock used in planting, both under forest conditions and as ornamentals, is grown from seed. Nursery grown seedlings grow slowly; 3-0 stock ranges from 13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 in) tall. Survival and height growth of planted hemlock, unlike natural regeneration, tend to be good both in the open and under partial overstories. Trees in a study in the Alleghenies grew significantly faster on north slopes under overstories of intermediate densities.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Because early growth of eastern hemlock is so slow, trees less than 2.5 cm (1 in) in d.b.h. may be as old as 100 years and 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) saplings may be 200 years old (34). Growth during the pole stage also tends to be slow, mainly because of crowding and overstory suppression. One 26 cm (10.3 in) tree in a dense stand, for example, was 359 years old. Other trees of the same age in the dominant portion of the stand ranged from 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. Although many trees may be suppressed for as long as 200 years, they retain good stem form and live crown ratios. Mature eastern hemlock trees attain relatively large diameters and height as well as retaining excellent stem form. The record age is reported to be 988 years, largest diameter 213 cm (84 in), and maximum height 49 m (160 ft) (34). In typical stands, however, ages approaching 400 years, diameters of 89 to 102 cm (35 to 40 in), and heights in excess of 30 m (100 ft) are most common (table 1). ""Accurate site index curves are not available for hemlock because most dominant trees have been suppressed during their early years, a result of the species' rigid overstory requirements for successful natural regeneration."" Yields of eastern hemlock tend to be higher than in most forest types except for white pine and red pine (Pinus resinosa). In New England, hemlock stands have about twice the volume of oak stands at 80 years of age but only from 50 to 60 percent of the volume of white pine stands at the same age (35). In northeastern Wisconsin on a typical loam podzol, well stocked hemlock and yellow birch stands attain volumes of 154 m³/ha (11,000 fbm) by age 110. On heavier soils, hemlock stands with a mixture of hardwoods reach volumes of 217 m³/ha (15,500 fbm) at 100 years. In pure, older stands gross volumes are reported in excess of 322 m³/ha (23,000 fbm) in Wisconsin and more than 560 m³/ha (40,000 fbm) in New England, but cull percent tends to increase rapidly in large diameter trees (31,35). Rooting Habit- To a great extent, site conditions determine the rooting habits of eastern hemlock. When the watertable is near the surface, root systems are shallow. On better drained sites, deeper rooting patterns may be observed. Reaction to Competition- Eastern hemlock is the most shade tolerant of all tree species (3,15,35). It can survive with as little as 5 percent of full sunlight, but under severe suppression only partial growth rings form and some may be missing entirely from the lower bole areas. In one study, from 10 to 40 rings were missing for a 120-year period of suppression. The tree is capable of withstanding suppression for as long as 400 years. At all ages, however, eastern hemlock responds to release in both height and diameter growth. Growth rates in excess of 6.4 cm (2.5 in) per decade are possible following release either from side or overhead suppression. Excessive release often results in reduced growth and mortality and has been a contributing factor to partial uprooting or windthrow because of shallow rooting. Trees originating on logs or stumps often develop stilted root systems and also are susceptible to windthrow (19). Even-aged or uneven-aged (selection) management systems can be successfully used to manage hemlock, but with certain limitations on the selection system. In the Lake States, the selection system has not always been successful and is not recommended for upland sites. In the East, the selection system has been used successfully on a limited basis, but the even-aged system is preferred and most frequently used. A 2- or 3-cut shelterwood system is the best even-aged method for regenerating eastern hemlock. It is effective because it promotes seed germination and early seedling development by reducing moisture stress. However, the site must be properly scarified and all competing understory hardwoods removed to develop satisfactory seedbed conditions before or immediately after the first and sometimes the second cut. In mixed stands of hardwoods and hemlock, where the proportion of hemlock is 15 percent or more, it is feasible to manage for hemlock, but at various residual stocking levels. Hemlock does not require as much growing space as hardwoods, so residual stocking is greater in stands where hemlock predominates. For example, a stand of trees averaging 25 cm (10 in) in diameter that contains 15 to 29 percent hemlock would be marked to favor hemlock at a residual stocking of about 22 m² (95 ft²) basal area of both hemlock and hardwoods. This same stand with 30 percent or more hemlock would be managed to 29 m² (125 ft²) of basal area. If less than 15 percent hemlock, the stand should be managed for the hardwood type represented. Many fully stocked stands of eastern hemlock have basal areas in excess of 69 m²/ha (300 ft²/acre). When thinning heavily stocked stands- 46 m²/ha (200 ft²/acre)- no more than one-third of the total basal area should be removed at one time. Excessive cutting results in reduced growth and increased mortality and contributes to windthrow. In addition, hardwood encroachment interferes with the successful establishment of hemlock. Fully stocked stands with densities less than 46 m²/ha (200 ft²/acre) can be thinned to a minimum of 27 m²/ha (120 m²/acre) without jeopardizing the residual stand (22). Acceptable standards for implementation of the uneven-aged system, based on field experience, include a residual stocking of 30 m²/ha (130 ft²/acre) in stands predominantly hemlock (50 percent or more); a stand structure (diameter distribution) of 35 percent poles 13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 in) d.b.h., and 65 percent sawtimber 30 cm (12 in) and larger. These guidelines will ensure a balanced growth between poletimber and sawtimber size classes. In addition, a continuous flow of ingrowth will occur and regeneration is assured if proper care is given to seedbed requirements. Damaging Agents- Seeds of eastern hemlock are sensitive to damage from several molds, particularly Botrytis spp., that reduce or delay germination (23). Some molds are borne internally while others colonize the seeds during germination. In one study, the fungus Aureobasidum pullulans was isolated from 73 percent of the seedcoats. In another test this mold was isolated twice from the embryonic tissue and 13 times from the seedcoat. Generally, molds are less injurious than desiccation during the germination and seedling stages. The most damaging agents to young seedlings, other than desiccation, are damping-off fungi and root rots (16). Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia spp. flourish in wet, poorly drained soils and in well-drained soils, respectively, and are common on eastern hemlock. At least three root rots- Cylindrocladium scoparium, Rhizina undulata (common on burn areas), and Fusarium moniliforme- are common on eastern hemlock. F. moniliforme has been isolated from embryonic tissue and seedcoats as well as in the soil (16,23). Several diseases affect the needles and twigs of eastern hemlock. The rust caused by Melampsora farlowii is one of the most damaging. It causes shoot blight and curls and attacks the cone often resulting in cone abortion. Three rusts caused by M. abietiscanadensis, Pucciniastrum hydrangeae, and P. vaccinii spp. affect only the needles. Single needle browning throughout the crown is caused by Fabrella tsugae. Lower foliage in very wet and shady areas often has a grayish mat appearance on both the needles and twigs caused by Rosellinia herpotrichioides. Dimerosporium tsugae occasionally forms a black, sooty growth on the needles. Living heartwood of eastern hemlock is attacked by Tyromyces borealis, particularly in the northeast, leaving white flecks in the wood. Pholiota adiposa is fairly common in the Lake States and causes a cavity along the pith axis. Other rots are the trunk rot caused by Haematostereum sanguinolentum; a brown, red ring rot caused by Phellinus pini; and a red heart rot caused by P. robustus. The red-varnish-topped fungus, Ganoderma tsugae, is the most common decayer of stumps and old logs. Numerous fungi are associated with the root system but rarely develop conks or kill trees. The most common are the shoestring fungus, Armillaria mellea, and the velvet top fungi, Phaeolus schweinitzii, Tyromyces balsameus, and Heterobasidion annosum. At least two mycorrhiza are known to occur on the roots (16). Although at least 24 insects attack eastern hemlock, few are economically important. The most important is the hemlock borer, Melanophila fulvoguttata, which attacks weakened trees. Symptoms usually consist of woodpecker-like holes in the bark, galleries filled with dark excrement, and yellowing shoot tips (27). Spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, defoliates and kills hemlock after defoliating all the balsam fir in the stand. The hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria, devours part of the needle after which the remainder turns brown. In nurseries, white grubs of the strawberry root weevil, Otiorhynchus ovatus, consume the roots, and larvae of the black vine weevil, O. sulcatus, feed on the needles (40). In the eastern States the hemlock scale, Abgrallaspis ithacae, damages young shade trees, and the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, kills understory trees. Numerous animals feed on eastern hemlock and often cause serious damage, marked loss of vigor, or even death. White-tailed deer readily browse this species although it has been ranked seventh in winter food preference. In some regions, patches of regeneration have been eliminated following heavy browsing in years when deer populations are high. Although deer have been blamed for the absence of eastern hemlock in many localities, no regeneration occurred under similar conditions in fenced areas; thus, overstory-site-temperature requirements are presumably more critical (2,6,8). Snowshoe hares and New England cottontails frequently browse eastern hemlock. Mice, voles, squirrels, and other rodents also feed on seeds and small seedlings both under natural stands and in nurseries (1). Porcupines occasionally gnaw the bark on larger trees causing serious wounds and top-kill (4). Sapsuckers have been associated with ring shake in some areas (19,21). Small eastern hemlock trees are highly susceptible to wildfire but prescribed burns are beneficial for securing natural regeneration. The thick bark of older trees is resistant to light burns but saplings are usually destroyed. Root injury often occurs from high intensity fires because of heavy litter accumulation. Drought is probably the most serious damaging agent to eastern hemlock, especially during the seedling stage. Winter drying caused by excessive transpiration on warm, windy days has caused severe needle injury. In later stages of stand development, heavy cuttings predispose trees to windthrow because of their shallow rooting habit. Older trees are susceptible to radial stress cracks and ring shake, particularly in partially cut stands (19). Eastern hemlock is sensitive to salt spray or drift and sulfur fumes and is one of the species most often struck by lightning (16,25).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,14,1
"The soil requirements for eastern hemlock are not exacting (35). They are universally characterized as being moist to very moist but with good drainage. In the Lake States the species grows on upland sandy loams, loamy sands, and silt loams, often with an abundance of ground or coarse rocky material throughout the upper profile deposited from glacial or fluvial material. In Canada and the northeastern States the soils under eastern hemlock tend to be shallow loams and silt loams, often over granite, gneiss, and slate bedrock (Typic, Lithic, and Entic Haplorthods of the order Spodosols). Typically, most soils are highly acid, particularly in the upper horizons, but some are near neutral. The heavy, slowly decomposing litter fosters podzolization or leaching as the stand increases in age. On sites in which eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) is a major component, the soils tend to be of a sandy texture, well mixed with humus, moist, and well drained (Alfic Haplorthods). Scattered patches of hemlock also occur on the finer glacial tills as well (Alfic Fragiorthods), but in general these soils have less hemlock than the coarser soils. Eastern hemlock grows from sea level to about 730 m (2,400 ft) in elevation in the northeastern and northern portions of the range. Most commonly it is found on benches, flats, and swamp borders, provided the peat and muck soils are shallow (Aquic Haplorthods or Aerie Haplaquods). On the Allegheny Plateau, especially in New York and Pennsylvania, most of the hemlock grows between 300 and 910 m (1,000 and 3,000 ft) (35). In the southern Appalachians the most frequent occurrences are at elevations of 610 to 1520 m (2,000 to 5,000 ft) and often are restricted to north and east slopes, coves, or cool, moist valleys (35). Outliers tend to be severely restricted by a combination of edaphic and climatic factors.",Soils and Topography,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,15,1
"Lumber production from eastern hemlock reached its peak between 1890 and 1910. Primary uses were in light framing, sheathing, roofing, subflooring, boxes, crates, and general millwork. Much of the present production is used in pulping or newsprint and wrapping papers, but the demand for hemlock lumber appears to be increasing again. Currently, eastern hemlock stands are considered essential for shelter and bedding of white-tailed deer during the winter. In regions of marked reductions in type area, many public agencies have restricted cutting until reliable methods of regenerating the stand become operational (6). The type also is considered important as cover for ruffed grouse, turkeys, and many other animals. Eastern hemlock often is planted as an ornamental because of its relative freedom from insects and disease, good foliage color, and adaptability to shearing. Some effort is being made to plant the species under forest conditions because it is so important to wildlife. Tannin from the bark of eastern hemlock formerly was extracted for use in processing leather. Now synthetic and important products are used and a once prosperous industry has been eliminated (19).",Special Uses,Eastern Hemlock,tsuga,canadensis,conifer,16,1
"Eastern hophornbeam is a minor member of most forest communities where it is present. It rarely attains a codominant or dominant crown position in mature stands and is not a commercial species. In the following forest cover types it is only a subordinate species (Society of American Foresters) (18): Boreal and Northern Forest Region 16 Aspen 20 White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple 24 Hemlock-Yellow Birch 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 26 Sugar Maple-Basswood 27 Sugar Maple 28 Black Cherry-Maple 33 Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 60 Beech-Sugar Maple Central Forest Region 42 Bur Oak 52 White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak 55 Northern Red Oak 110 Black Oak Southern Forest Region (30) 82 Loblolly Pine-Hardwood 87 Sweetgum-Yellow-Poplar 91 Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak It probably occurs in other types but is omitted from their descriptions, particularly in the South where the types are complex. The species occurs in all nine forest regions Braun recognizes in the eastern deciduous forest formation (6). One plant association based on the species, in which eastern hophornbeam is second in importance to sugar maple, is recognized in Quebec as the Ostryo-Aceratum saccaharai association that occurs on dry knoll tops (31). From the northern part of its range to Missouri, Tennessee, and Maryland, eastern hophornbeam reaches its greatest abundance in hardwood communities dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), or both. It may be the second most important species in some stands. Occasionally, it is abundant in stands dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and northern red oak (Quercus rubra). In aspen stands, it is a member of a northern hardwood understory reclaiming the site. In the central United States the species is frequently an important subcanopy component of stands dominated by white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Q. velutina), northern red oak, scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), and southern red oak (Q. falcata). The species named in the northern forest types plus white ash (Fraxinus americana) and American elm (Ulmus americana) are eastern hophornbeam's most frequent associates in the North. Progressing southward, the following species are added as associates: bitternut (Carya cordiformis), shagbark (C. ovata), and pignut (C. glabra), hickories; sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua); blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica); yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera); slippery elm (Ulmus rubra); sassafras (Sassafras albidum); and flowering dogwood (Cornus florida). The extremely species-rich mixed mesophytic forests of the Cumberland Mountains and plateau have minor amounts of eastern hophornbeam. Within the Piedmont and Coastal Plains of the South the species grows in the southern mixed hardwood and in loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (P echinata) pine-dominated forests. Although typically a minor component of southern mixed hardwood stands, it is occasionally the second most abundant species (35,36). In these forests it is associated with many trees including American beech, southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), white oak, loblolly pine, and shortleaf pine; and with many understory species including flowering dogwood, American holly (Ilex opaca), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), tree sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), and pawpaw (Asimina triloba). Other associated trees include blackgum; sweetgum; yellow-poplar; southern red laurel (Quercus laurifolia), water (Q. nigra), swamp chestnut (Q. michauxii), post (Q. stellata), black, cherrybark (Q. falcata var. pagodifolia), shumard (Q. shumardii), and scarlet oaks; mockernut (Carya tomentosa), sand (C. pallida), pignut, and bitternut hickories; American basswood (Tilia americana); red (Acer rubrum) and Florida (A. barbatum) maples; winged (Ulmus alata) and slippery elms; and white and green (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) ashes. Shrubs that occur with eastern hophornbeam. in the north include mountain maple (Acer spicatum), roundleaf dogwood (Cornus rugosa), American hazel (Corylus americana), beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (Diervilla lonicera), Atlantic leatherwood (Dirca palustris), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), fly honeysuckle (Lonicera canadensis), American elder (Sambucus canadensis), redberry elder (Sambucus pubens), American yew (Taxus canadensis), mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium), and hobblebush (Viburnum alnifolium).

"Eastern hophornbeam occurs throughout most of the eastern half of the United States. The range extends from Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island west through southern Ontario, northern Michigan, to southeastern Manitoba; south into North Dakota, the Black Hills of South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming, along the Niobrara River Valley and Delta areas. It is also found in the mountains of Mexico, south to El Salvador and Honduras. -The native range of eastern hophornbeam.",Native Range,Eastern Hophornbeam,ostrya,virginiana,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Eastern hophornbearn is monoecious; from I to 3 staminate catkins develop at the end of branches late in the summer that precede pistillate flower development. Pollen forms, matures, and is shed in spring. It is wind disseminated. Solitary pistillate catkins first appear with the beginning of leaf development, and full bloom occurs about a month later. In the southeast, flowering occurs between March 25 and April 16, and in the north, between mid-May and mid-June (21). Seed Production and Dissemination- The fruits complete development during the summer and are ripe by the end of August in Michigan and as late as October in the South. The hoplike strobile begins to break up immediately after ripening and the seeds are dispersed throughout the fall and into early winter. Seeds should be collected when the strobiles are a pale greenish brown and before they dry enough to shatter. Seeds are light-about 66,000 cleaned seeds per kilogram (30,000/lb). The nuts are 7 min (0.3 in) long and are enclosed in an inflated sac about 20 min (0.8 in) long that provides buoyancy and improved dispersal by the wind. Birds provide a secondary means of seed dispersal. Trees begin to be fruitful at age 25. Seed production in northern hardwood stands has averaged 124,000/ha (50,000/acre) (19,21,37). Seedling Development- Seeds usually germinate in the spring the year after they are shed. Germination is epigeal. The seeds have a form of internal dormancy that requires stratification to overcome. Potential germination is 85 to 90 percent but germination capacity is only 27 to 65 percent (44). Information is scarce on the relation of germination and seedling establishment to the environment. The occurrence of reproduction on a variety of sites in undisturbed forests indicates its ability to become established on various seedbeds, soils, and moisture regimes under dense shade. Conversely, the ecesis of the species into old fields demonstrates its ability to become established in the open in competition with a heavy cover of grasses and forbs. Mechanical scarification to expose mineral soil seedbeds in an Ontario partially cut sugar maple stand had no effect on eastern hophornbearn abundance after 10 years (50). Seedlings have the potential for unusually fast juvenile height growth (27,48,54). In Pennsylvania eastern hophornbeam was 2.1 rn (7 ft) tall 5 years after a partial harvest of the overstory. In Michigan, the species averaged 3.4 in (11 ft) tall 10 years after an improvement cut and 5.9 rn (19.5 ft) tall 20 years after the cut. Advance reproduction of eastern hophornbearn is aggressive when released by overstory cutting, a trait that makes its proportion in the reproduced stand similar to that in the original stand regardless of the cutting method (53). Its position in the new stand may even be improved if new reproduction of eastern hophornbearn becomes established, as is likely, or if mortality increases among the other species. Increases have occurred after clearcutting and seedtree and selection cuttings in West Virginia Appalachian hardwood stands on better sites (48). Similarly, the species proportion of the basal area stocking in northern hardwood stands in Wisconsin increased after strip clearcutting and after a shelterwood removal (21). Greater increases in the species relative abundance have occurred when northern hardwood stands less than 40 years old are clearcut because little advance reproduction of other species is present at this time (28). The species' response to fire apparently is related to the severity of the fire. Areas burned severely enough to kill almost the entire overstory in 21 white oak-scarlet oak stands in Rhode Island contained no eastern hophornbearn 5 to 51 years later. In unburned stands the species made up 10 percent of the understory stems (9). After a prescribed bum of a clearcut aspen stand, eastern hophornbeam remained constant, because new sprouting equalled mortality during the 5 years following the burn (39). Accidental fires in two sugar maple stands in New York resulted in increased sugar maple and eastern hophornbearn stocking because of sprouting (46). The initial incidence of fire in the Big Woods of Minnesota converted the forest to a thicket of basswood and eastern hophornbeam (13). Subsequent fires converted them to a bur oak savanna. Vegetative Reproduction- Stump sprouting is common on cut, burned, or injured trees. The proportion of stumps sprouting increases with stump height. Only 17 percent of the stumps cut at ground line sprouted, whereas 40 percent of stumps cut at a height of 15 cm (6 in) sprouted and between 80 and 90 percent of stumps cut at a height of more than 30 cm (12 in) sprouted (15). Sprouts arose from dormant adventitious buds on the stump and no root suckering occurred. After fires, 62 percent of the top-killed stems in New York (46) and 100 percent of those in Minnesota sprouted (39). Number of sprouts per clump averaged 4.4 in New York and 32 in Minnesota. Height growth of the Minnesota sprouts averaged 2.4 in (7.9 ft) after 5 years, which is about average for the other species measured. Height growth of eastern hophornbeam sprouts in an Allegheny hardwood stand exceeded that of other sprouting species (27).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern Hophornbeam,ostrya,virginiana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Eastern hophornbeam trees are normally less than 30 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. and less than 12 m (40 ft) tall, except in east Texas and south Arkansas where they may reach a height of from 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft). Occasionally they reach saw log size. The largest tree is 91 cm (36 in) in d.b.h., 22 in (73 ft) tall, and has a crown spread of 27 m (88 ft). It was found in 1976 in Michigan. The slow growth and small size of the species earn it the title ""weed"" throughout its range, especially in some areas in the South where it is considered the number one weed species. Eastern hophornbeam usually is discriminated against in stands managed for timber. Silviculturally, more interest has been given to eradicating it than to improving its growth. Girdling is effective in eradicating the species, killing the tree within 2 years. Herbicides (especially 2,4,5-T, and Tordon 101) applied by mist blowing, tree injection, or spraying at the tree base, on cut stumps, or in frills have also been successful. Diameter growth rates under individual tree selection management of northern hardwoods in Wisconsin and Michigan average 12 to 13 mm (0.48 to 0.51 in) per decade for poles and saplings, respectively (21). Sugar maple, the most abundant species in these stands, averages from 3.8 to 5.0 cm (1.5 to 2.0 in) per decade for poles and saw logs. Annual ingrowth in these stands is averaging 0.2 and 3.1 trees per hectare (0.1 and 1.3/acre) into the pole and sapling classes, respectively, and exceeds mortality in all but one stand, so stocking of eastern hophornbeam. is increasing. Subcanopy trees in Michigan stands average 9.9 in (32.5 ft) tall after 50 years with growth progressively declining as the trees age, the peak growth of 3.3 m (10.8 ft) occurring the first decade (54). The biomass of trees with basal diameters ranging between 5 and 23 mm (0.2 and 0.9 in) can be estimated by the equation Y = 34.3X±. §where Y is the total plant weight in grams and X is the basal diameter in centimeters; the equation accounts for 98 percent of the variation in weights (16). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- The species typically grows in climax forests in the northern part of its range. It is classed as shade tolerant and reproduces well under full shade. Ecologists rank it high in their ratings of species climax potential (12,51). In the South the composition of the climax forests has not been clearly identified. The species is associated with later seral stages that follow the pioneer pine communities. Eastern hophornbeam first appears in piedmont pine stands after they are about 90 years old and in bottom-land hardwoods after they are about 36 years old (38). Repeated harvesting of the larger, commercial species from hardwood stands that contain well-developed subcanopies of eastern hophornbeam and its allies may allow the subcanopy to dominate and prevent the reproduction of the original overstory species (14,29). Damaging Agents- The most important disease problems are the trunk and butt rots. The species is one of the most defective in Ontario-defect claims 20 percent of the gross merchantable cubic foot volumes of trees more than 10 cm (4 in) d.b.h. (3). Losses are greatest in trees 95 to 140 years old and more than 18 cm (7 in) d.b.h., with cull averaging 32 percent. Brown stains cause 62 percent of the defect, while yellow-brown stringy rot, white spongy rot, and an incipient yellow rot account for most of the remaining defect. The organisms primarily responsible are Stereum murrayi, Phellinus igniarius, and Pholiota limonella (3). Throughout its range, eastern hophornbeam is browsed by white-tailed deer only incidentally. Selective deer browsing of more desirable species of reproduction increases the proportion of beech and eastern hophornbeam, which are avoided in heavily browsed regenerated stands in New York (42). Beaver in Ohio prefer the species as food-it was the most utilized food after alder and aspen in one drainage (25). Eastern hophornbeam is considered to be relatively free of insect and other disease problems. The species is not readily injured by cold temperatures; succulent growth was not damaged until temperatures dropped below -8° C (17° F) in Wisconsin (1). It is sensitive to pollutants in the upper Ohio River Valley, where it does not grow in areas with high exposure to oxides of sulfur or nitrogen, or to chlorine or fluorine (33). Its tough, resilient branches resist wind, snow, and ice damage.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern Hophornbeam,ostrya,virginiana,hardwood,14,0
"Eastern hophornbeam grows on a wide variety of soil and physiographic conditions throughout its range. It is found on soils in all of the major orders in the Eastern United States, Spodosols in the North, Alfisols in the North and Central, Mollisols in the Central, Ultisols in the South, and Entisols and Inceptisols throughout. Along the northernmost portion of its range, eastern hophornbeam is found on dry-mesic to xeric sites, areas with shallow soils, and bedrock outcrops on upper slopes and ridgetops (31,53). Just to the south within Ontario and Quebec, it grows primarily on mesic and dry-mesic sites. In Wisconsin the species is most abundant on mesic sites usually associated with a mid-catena position, but it also occurs on dry-mesic, wet-mesic, and xeric sites (12). Mesic sites throughout the Appalachians are most favorable (32,52), but the species tolerates a progressively wider range of conditions northward. In the Smokies and southern Cumberland Plateau it is limited to north slopes, protected lower slopes, ravines, and coves. It grows primarily on dry-mesic and mesic valley bottoms and lower slope positions in the highlands of New Jersey but does extend upslope to drier positions. In Massachusetts it is also found in xeric positions on ridgetops as well (17,43). From the central lowlands southward the species is associated with wet-mesic to dry-mesic sites. It is frequently found on xeric sites in northcentral Florida, however (35). Through the Ozark Plateau, Central Lowlands, and the Kentucky-Tennessee Highland Rim best development occurs on welldrained flood plains of the major rivers, ravines, coves, and lower slopes. Progressing upslope it is less abundant, becoming rare in xeric situations, and it is absent from the wettest sites as on lower flood plains, depressions, sink holes, and bogs (45,47,49). In the south the species is most frequent on terraces of minor streams, common on the well-drained terraces and outwash in major bottoms, and occurs in most upland situations (40,41). Originally it was limited to sites not subject to frequent wildfire in the south such as those protected by bodies of water, swamps, or bottom lands, or those that are less prone to fire such as ravines or steep bluffs along streams (14). At the westernmost extension of the species range in the Black Hills of South Dakota, the tree grows principally in mesic, deciduous streamside communities at lower elevations and to a much lesser extent on dry-mesic but deep-soiled pine sites. Eastern hophornbeam grows below elevations of 910 in (3,000 ft) in the northern Appalachians but is most often found at 75 to 230 in (250 to 750 ft) in Quebec (5), and at about 460 in (1,500 ft) in New York (7). Its upper elevational limit is 1520 in (5,000 ft) in the southern Appalachians, although it is more common from 850 to 980 in (2,800 to 3,200 ft). The lowest slope position it occupies is determined by its intolerance of flooding. It was the third most flood sensitive of 39 species compared in Tennessee, where inundation 16 percent or more of the time killed all eastern hophornbeam (22). Along an Illinois stream it is limited to positions flooded less than I percent of the time (4). Surface soils on sites occupied by eastern hophornbeam include a full range of textures and moisture-drainage classes. Best development of the species is associated with soils that are in loam or loam-modified textural classes and on somewhat poorly drained to well-drained soils. Surface soil pH ranges from 4.2 to 7.6 in the northern half of its range (10,26). In the mid-South the pH range is narrower-from 4.6 to 5.6 (8). Nevertheless, the species does occur on sites with shallow soils over limestone or soils with limestone fragments at various locations throughout its range. The calcium content of the foliage of eastern hophornbeam is high in comparison to other species on the same site. Concentrations frequently exceed 2 percent on the basis of ovendry leaf weight (2,11). Nitrogen concentrations range from moderate to high in comparison to the other species on the site, but concentrations of phosphorus and potassium are usually low.",Soils and Topography,Eastern Hophornbeam,ostrya,virginiana,hardwood,15,0
"Buds and catkins of eastern hophornbeam are important winter food for ruffed grouse, equal to the value of aspen and birch, and the nuts are secondary food in the fall. It is a preferred food for sharp-tailed grouse and wild turkey and is eaten to a lesser extent by bobwhite, red and grey squirrels, cottontails, white-tailed deer, ring-necked pheasant, purple finch, rose-breasted grosbeak, and downy woodpeckers (23,24). The tree is not commonly used as an ornamental because of its slow growth and sensitivity to pollutants.",Special Uses,Eastern Hophornbeam,ostrya,virginiana,hardwood,16,0
"Redbud is a regular but usually not a common understory component of many forest types throughout the Eastern United States. It is not a commercial timber species, and although it grows in many forest cover types, it is not listed in all of them by the Society of American Foresters (4).",Associated Forest Cover,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,1,0
A wide range of climatic conditions are present in the large geographical range of redbud. Mean annual precipitation is less than 510 mm (20 in) in dry south Texas and approximately 1270 mm (50 in) in moist central Florida. Mean annual snowfall in the northern perimeter of redbud is about 90 cm (35 in). Mean January temperatures vary from -8° C (18° F) to 16° C (61° F) within the native range of redbud. Mean July temperatures vary from about 21° C (70° F) in southern Pennsylvania to 26° C (79° F) in central Florida. Frost-free days can vary from 160 to 300 days.,Climate,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,2,0
"Donselman (3) investigated morphological variation in trees grown from seed collected from 13 diverse locations in the range of redbud. He concluded that trees from more xeric locations in the Southwestern and western portions of the range exhibited adaptations to high solar radiation, drying winds, low humidity, low soil moisture, and other environmental factors associated with high evapotranspiration. Leaves from those plants were thicker and smaller, had increased pubescence, and showed more efficient stomatal geometry than trees from mesic locations. Two subspecies of redbud have been identified: Texas redbud (Cercis canadensis var. texensis) found in southern Oklahoma, Trans-Pecos Texas, and southeastern New Mexico; and eastern redbud (C. canadensis var. canadensis) found in the remainder of the range of redbud (9). Another native Cercis species, California redbud (C. occidentalis), is found in Utah, Nevada, California and Arizona.",Genetics,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,7,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Redbud flowers are pink to reddish purple, and rarely white. They are home on pedicels in clusters of two to eight. Flowers are produced from small buds on old twigs, branches, and trunks. Flowers are bisexual and the tree is self-pollinating. Flowering usually occurs sometime from March to May and precedes leafing. In Indiana, the tree requires 30 days of temperatures averaging more than 10° C (50° F) . Previous winter chilling also enhances flowering (11). Pollination is usually accomplished by bees. After 2 or 3 weeks leaves appear and the flowers drop. The ovaries of one to several flowers in most flower clusters enlarge and develop into fruits that reach their full size by midsummer (13). Fruits are flat reddish-brown pods about 1.3 cm (0.5 in) wide and 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long (16). Each fruit contains 4 to 10 brown, hard, compressed bean-like seeds, each about 6mm (0.25 in) long. The fruits remain on the tree until after leaf fall; some persist throughout winter (15). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are released by the opening of fruit sutures or decay of the fruit wall. Most seeds are dispersed during fall and winter by wind and animals. Many seeds are injured by insects. Those that fall to the ground usually remain dormant for several years (1). For artificial propagation, seeds should be collected, cleaned, and dried when ripe to avoid insect damage. Dried seeds can be stored in sealed glass or metal containers at 2' to 5' C (35' to 41° F). Seed treatment is necessary for propagation because redbud shows delayed germination due to impermeability of the seed coat to water and dormancy of the embryo (1). The seed coat can be made permeable to water by mechanical scarification or by immersion in boiling water or in concentrated sulfuric acid for about 30 minutes. After scarifying, seeds should be stratified in moist sand at about 5° C (41' F) for 5 to 8 weeks (14). Prepared seeds should be sown in well-prepared seedbeds in late April or early May (14). Moist soil should cover seeds at a maximum depth of 0.5 em (0.2 in). Propagation can also be accomplished by layering or cuttings. Seedling Development- Approximate site characteristics and seedling vigor determine seedling establishment. Germination is epigeal (14). Under optimum conditions seedlings can grow 0.3 m (1 ft) in height the first growing season. Continuous terminal growth is related to light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature (11). Once established, seedlings can endure much shading. Vegetative Reproduction- No information available.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Development of young redbud to the flowering stage is rapid. Young redbuds have been observed first flowering when less than 7 years old but do not fruit the first year of blossoming. Annual cambial growth begins just before flowering and shoot growth usually begins during flowering (11). In Indiana terminal growth of saplings started when the weekly mean of the daily mean temperature reached 13° C (55° F). Maximum growth was reached the fourth week and growth ceased after 6 to 10 weeks under low soil moisture conditions. With adequate soil moisture, terminal growth continued until frost. More than 1076 lux (100 lumens/ft²) of light and more than 13 hours of daylight daily are needed to maintain terminal growth of saplings. Rooting Habit- Redbud develops a deep taproot that descends rapidly the first few years if the soil permits. Initial growth depends on soil moisture and the absence of a tight clay subsoil. If impenetrable subsoils are present the taproot grows horizontally. Secondary roots appear when the taproot is 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) long and grow rapidly. Reaction to Competition- As redbuds grow and mature they become less shade tolerant. Old trees usually suffer from heart rot and cannot normally tolerate severe competition and shade. Redbud is most accurately classed as tolerant of shade. Damaging Agents- Redbud is a host to a variety of insects, but damage is not normally severe. Bark and phloem borers include three species of Hypothenemus, and Pityophthorus lautus (2). A seed beetle, Gibbobruchus mimus, breeds in the seed of redbud. Numerous wood borers have been found in redbud. Agrilus otiosus, three species of Hypothenemus, three species of Micracis, two species of Microcisella, Pityophthorus lautus, Ptosima gibbicollis, and Thysanoes fimbricornis all inhabit portions of the wood of redbud. Other insects feed on the leaves of redbud. The redbud leaffolder, Fascista cercerisella, feeds on leaves which the larvae web together. The grape leaffolder, Desmia funeralis, an important pest of grape, also feeds on redbud. The Japanese weevil, Callirhopalus bifasciatus, and Norape ovina both consume redbud leaves. Other insects feed on redbud by extracting juices from the plant. The twolined spittlebug, Prosapia bicincta, has been recorded feeding on redbud. The terrapin scale, Mesolecanium nigrofasciatum, and San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus, like most of the other redbud parasites, inhabit a variety of hosts including redbud. The periodical cicada, Magicicada septendecim, lays its eggs in more than 70 species of trees and other plants, including redbud. There are three main diseases of redbud: leaf anthracnose, Mycosphaerella cercidicola, Botryosphaeria canker, and Verticillium wilt (6). The most serious is the canker Botryosphaeria ribis or its variety chromogena. The species is mainly a saprobe; the variety is a parasite. This variety produces stem and twig lesions and entire groves of redbuds have been killed by this disease. Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum) sometimes kills redbuds, especially in the Midwestern United States. Redbud is vulnerable to Texas root rot (Phymatotrichum omnivorum), but redbud is not commonly grown in its range. A variety of sap and heart rots also infect eastern redbud.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,14,0
"Redbud is found on a variety of sites ranging from xeric to mesic but grows better on moist, well-drained sites. It is normally more abundant on south-facing slopes where sunlight is more intense and there is less plant competition (11). This species does not usually grow on flooded sites because it cannot endure inundation or survive in poorly aerated soils. The tree grows well in a variety of soil textures but is not found in coarse sands (11). It requires some fine or colloidal material. Redbud is tolerant of a wide pH range but grows best where the pH is above 7.5. It is prevalent on limestone outcrops and on alkaline soils derived from them (11,12). Redbud is tolerant of nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, less competition can occur from associated trees that are less vigorous on the nutrient deficient sites. In Indiana no relationship was noted between distribution of redbud and soil calcium or magnesium. Redbud is found on soils of most soil orders, but most commonly on those of the orders Alfisols and Mollisols.",Soils and Topography,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,15,0
"The eastern redbud is extensively planted as an ornamental throughout the Eastern United States. It is tolerant of a wide range of site conditions, is not especially vulnerable to insects or diseases, is relatively easy to maintain, and makes a beautiful shrub or small tree, especially when flowering. Bark of redbud has been used as an astringent in the treatment of dysentery. Flowers of the tree can be put into salads or fried and eaten (16). There is some documented wildlife use of redbud fruit. Cardinals have been observed feeding on the seeds, and seeds have been consumed by ring-necked pheasants rose-breasted grosbeaks (5), and bobwhites (7) White-tailed deer and gray squirrels have also been observed feeding on the seeds (5). Flowers of the tree are regarded as important in the production of honey by bees (10).",Special Uses,Eastern Redbud,cercis,canadensis,hardwood,16,0
"Pure stands of eastern redcedar are scattered throughout the primary range of the species. Most of these stands are on abandoned farm lands or drier upland sites. The forest cover type Eastern Redcedar (Society of American Foresters Type 46) is widespread and therefore has many associates (10). Variants of the type are eastern redcedar-pine, eastern redcedar-hardwood, and eastern redcedar-pine-hardwood. The eastern redcedar-pine variant is composed of eastern redcedar and either shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) or Virginia pine (P. virginiana) and is found throughout the southern half of its range. The eastern redcedar-hardwood variant is found throughout the central part of its range and includes a mixture of red (Quercus rubra) and white (Q.alba) oaks, hickories (Carya spp.), black walnut (Juglans nigra), and other hardwoods. The third variant, eastern redcedar-pine-hardwood, includes all of the above species associations (15). Eastern redcedar appears as a minor component of several other forest cover types. Eastern redcedar is among the first to invade abandoned fields and areas cleared for pasture (25). On deeper soils, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum) are associated invaders and may crowd it out. In cedar glades, the species is commonly associated with blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), winged elm (Ulmus alata), fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), Carolina buckthorn (Rhamnus caroliniana), rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum), and Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens). Little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius), big bluestem (A. gerardi), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), dropseed (Sporobolus spp.), and numerous composites and legumes are common herbaceous plants.",Associated Forest Cover,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,1,1
"The wide natural distribution of eastern redcedar clearly indicates its ability to grow under varying and extreme climatic conditions. Average annual precipitation varies from about 380 mm (15 in) in the northwestern section to 1520 mm (60 in) in the southern parts of its range (40). Throughout the eastern redcedar range, average precipitation from April through September measures from 380 mm (15 in) to 760 mm (30 in). This suggests that summer precipitation may be more limiting to the species than average annual precipitation. Average annual snowfall ranges from a trace to more than 254 cm (100 in). Average annual temperatures vary from about 4° C (40° F) in the north to 20° C (68° F) in the southern part of the botanical range. Average annual maximum temperature ranges only from about 32° C (90° F) to 41° C (105° F), but average minimum temperature ranges from -43° C (-45° F) to -7° C (20° F). The growing season varies from about 120 to 250 days.",Climate,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,2,1
"Two distinct varieties have been recognized in the United States. Juniperus virginiana var. crebra (Fernald) is a northern form having a narrow crown and slightly pitted seeds. The other variety, J. virginiana var. ambigens, is an intermediate form between eastern redcedar and creeping juniper, J. horizontalis Moench (15). Although there are no recognized hybrids at this time, evidence is mounting that hybridization does occur. Population studies, especially in the western part of eastern redcedar's range, suggest that considerable introgression and perhaps blending of genetic differences have occurred whenever species' ranges overlap; and that J. virginiana readily hybridizes with J. scopulorum, J. horizontalis, and J. ashei, resulting in juniper populations that contain the germ plasm of two or three species (15). Research in the Ozarks, however, showed no evidence of introgression into J. ashei by J. virginiana where J. ashei was surrounded by J. virginiana (2). The relatively strong influence of J. scopulorum germ plasm in the western part of the eastern redcedar population suggests that the entire population in the area studied is of hybrid origin (41). This west-to-east flow of J. scopulorum germ plasm was further supported by Flake, Urbatch, and Turner (14), who sampled many of Van Haverbeke's sample trees for terpenoid analysis. He proposed an alternative hypothesis that eastern redcedar of eastern and central North America may have been derived from the western juniper complex.",Hybrids,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,9,1

"Eastern redcedar displays great diversity in phenotypic characteristics such as tree form, foliage color, and crown shape. Van Haverbeke's study (41) included a total of 43 gross morphological, foliage, cone, and seed characteristics and biochemical data derived from cone pulp. He points out that much of the research on morphological characteristics of eastern redcedar has been in the central and western parts of the species' range. More recently, however, information on genetic variation in natural stands in the eastern part of its range has been obtained (13). Natural variation in the species may have been modified by past commercial exploitation of natural stands and by the selection, propagation, and distribution of clones (47).",Population Differences,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Eastern redcedar is a dioecious species, and trees probably reach sexual maturity at about 10 years. Staminate strobili or conelets begin to develop on male trees at the tips of axillary branches of new scale-leaves. Pollen grains are formed by late September in conelets having 10 to 12 entire-margined sporophylls. Staminate strobili turn a conspicuous yellowish brown when they reach maturity during winter, and thus male trees are readily distinguished from ovulate ones. Small green conelets begin to develop by early fall or late summer on ovulate trees but grow very little during the winter. They are borne terminally on axillary branches of the new scale-leaves but do not become conspicuous until late February to early spring. At this time the microsporangial walls of the staminate conelets split longitudinally, discharging the mature pollen. Pollen grains lodge at the end of the micropyle of the many ovules in the conelet. Pollination is complete in a few days when the conelet closes. Growth of the pollen tube is slow at first but becomes active by late May or mid-June. Fertilization occurs in June and the mature embryo is full grown in about 2 months, anytime from late July to mid-November, depending on location. As the ovulate cone develops, greenish fruit-scales form the outer fleshy protective coat of the berrylike cone. Cones change color from green to greenish white to whitish blue and finally to bluish as the season progresses. Each cone or fruit contains one to four (occasionally more) rounded or angled brownish seeds, 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.16 in) long, often with longitudinal pits. The seed coat has a thick and bony outer layer and a thin, membranous inner layer (23,47). Seed Production and Dissemination- Mature eastern redcedar trees produce some seeds nearly every year, but good crops occur only every 2 or 3 years. The cones do not open and will remain on the tree through the winter, although many are eaten and dispersed by animals. Most remaining cones are dispersed in February to March. Mature fruits are usually collected in the fall by hand-stripping or shaking onto canvas. Seeds may be stored as dried fruits or cleaned seeds. After fanning to remove leaves, twigs, and other debris, the seeds can be extracted by running the fruit through a macerator and floating the pulp and empty seeds away. Dried fruits should be soaked in water several hours before macerating. Since eastern redcedar fruits are resinous, they should be soaked in a weak lye solution for 1 or 2 days. The soaking helps separate the oily, resinous pulp from the seeds and aids further washing, flotation, and stratification. This treatment should be followed by thorough washing (45). The cleaned seeds are ready for use, or they can be dried to 10 to 12 percent moisture content for storage at -7° C (20° F) to 4° C (40° F). The number of cleaned seeds per kilogram ranges from 81,570 (37,000/lb) to 121,250 (55,000/lb) and averages 96,120 (43,600/lb) (23). If seeds are to be sown in the spring, they should be soaked in a citric acid solution (10,000 ppm) for 96-hours, placed in moist-warm stratification at 24° C (75° F) for 6 weeks, and finally placed in moist-cool stratification at 5° C (41° F) for 10 weeks. Germination is best if fresh seeds are used. If desired, dry, stored seeds may be sown in mid-July, which accomplishes moist-warm stratification, and the over-winter period accomplishes moist-cool stratification for early spring germination (46). In nursery practice, eastern redcedar seeds are broadcast or sown in rows spaced 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) apart in well-prepared seedbeds and covered with about 6 mm (0.25 in) of firmed soil or sand. Stratified seeds should be sown in the spring early enough to allow completion of germination before air temperatures exceed 21° C (70° F). Germination of stratified seed usually begins in 6 to 10 days after sowing and is completed in 4 to 5 weeks. Untreated seeds may be sown in the fall and mulched until germination during the second spring after planting (23); but when fruits are depulped, dried, and stored at -16° C (4° F), seeds germinate the first spring after summer sowing (46). Germination is epigeal. Fruits are eaten by birds and other animals, which are important vectors for seed dissemination (20). Seeds that pass through animal digestive tracts and those that remain on the ground beneath the trees may germinate the first or second spring. Most of the natural germination of eastern redcedar seed takes place in early spring of the second year after dispersal. Eastern redcedar may also be established by hand direct-seeding or machine-sowing (29). Both hand and furrow seeding are successful when stratified seeds are used at the rate of 1.35 kg/ha (1.2 lb/acre). Seedling catch is best where the amount of litter has been reduced and hardwood competition has been completely removed. The rate of sowing may be adjusted to allow for variations in germinative capacity of the seeds and degree of competition control. Seedling Development- Eastern redcedar seedlings grown in nurseries may be transplanted from seedling beds after 1 or 2 years. Spacing in transplant beds ranges from about 15 by 3 cm (6 by 1 in) to 20 by 5 cm (8 by 2 in), depending on locality. The age at which trees are outplanted varies from area to area. Generally, eastern redcedar is field planted as 2-0, 3-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, or 2-2 stock (numbers refer respectively to growing seasons in seedling beds and transplant beds). Survival and growth of planted stock can be improved by grading the seedlings just after lifting from the nursery beds. Seedlings that are relatively small, topheavy, oversized, damaged, diseased, or insect-infested are discarded (37). Culling after lifting from transplant beds is usually 1 to 3 percent, compared to 5 to 20 percent from seedling beds. Eastern redcedar seedlings should have a stem diameter of at least 4.0 mm (0.16 in), but preferably 5.6 mm (0.22 in), at the ground line. It is also desirable for seedlings to have top green weights that are no more than 3 to 4 times heavier than the roots (26,36). Seedlings having higher top-to-root ratios are more likely to die under environmental stress. Survival of eastern redcedar plantations has been variable, with low survival being attributed to poor seedling quality, low site quality, and competition. If these factors are considered carefully, however, eastern redcedar plantations can be successfully established. One early plantation established from hand-pulled wildlings had 84 percent survival. In a Nebraska plantation, established with 2-0 seedlings from 204 sources of eastern redcedar and Rocky Mountain juniper, first-year survival averaged 95.1 percent. Four other plantations from these sources averaged more than 85 percent survival, although one in Oklahoma had only 19.7 percent (11,38). Most natural eastern redcedar regeneration takes place on relatively poor hardwood or pine sites, along fence rows, or in pastures that are not burned or mowed. Seedlings are commonly established in rather open hardwood stands, adjacent to older seed-bearing eastern redcedar trees, as a result of birds eating the fruit and subsequent deposition of seeds (34). On very dry sites, most seedlings are found in crevices, between layers of limestone, and in other protected places where the microclimate is most favorable. Seedling development is relatively slow on these adverse sites, although eastern redcedar seedlings withstand drought rather well (4,22). First-year seedlings do not produce much height growth but develop a long fibrous root system (15). Plantings from 2-0 stock showed good growth in some areas, however, exceeding 45 cm (17.8 in) in height after one growing season (38). If competition from an overstory is rather severe, eastern redcedar seedlings may not survive. Once established, however, eastern redcedar survives for extended periods under severe competition (15,28). Eastern redcedar also competes very well in shelterbelts, where it is the most common natural reproduction (43). Vegetative Reproduction- Eastern redcedar does not reproduce naturally by sprouting or suckering, but the species may be propagated by grafting, by air-layering, or from cuttings (6,15,33,44).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Growth rates of eastern redcedar depend largely on site quality, competition from other species, and stand density. These factors probably reflect competition for available soil moisture on most sites. Trees 20 to 30 years old are generally 5 to 8 m (18 to 26 ft) tall and 6 to 8 cm (2.3 to 3.0 in) in d.b.h. Mature trees are usually 12 to 15 m (40 to 50 ft) tall and 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h. On good sites, trees may reach 37 m (120 ft) in height and 122 cm (48 in) in d.b.h. (25). Some of the earliest data on diameter growth in natural eastern redcedar stands is presented in table 2 (3). Site classes mentioned are those described in table 1. Analysis of these data provided equations to compute the height-age relationships in table 3. The relation of height of dominant and codominant trees to d.b.h. and stand density was also determined, after pooling of data for age and site classes (11). Height growth, a reflection of soil depth and fertility, increases with stocking density (fig 1). Figure 1- Relation of height to d.b.h. by stocking class. Other studies in Arkansas have shown that growth and yield are affected by stand density and hardwood competition. In a 45-year-old eastern redcedar stand, highest volume growth was obtained in unthinned stands from which hardwoods had been removed. Volumes averaged 1.96 m³/ha (28 ft³/acre) per year during a 14-year period. This was double the growth of stands where hardwoods were left. A stand containing 432 crop trees per hectare (175/acre), 7.6 cm (3.0 in) d.b.h. and larger grew nearly the same volume after 14 years when 80 percent of the competition was removed as an unreleased stand of 988 trees per hectare (400/acre) (11). Over a 10-year period in northern Arkansas, completely released stands averaged higher growth in d.b.h., basal area, and volume than stands where only crown competition was removed. The greatest mean d.b.h. growth, 6.4 cm (2.5 in), occurred with the lightest stocking, 124 crop trees per hectare (50/acre). As stocking increased, mean d.b.h. growth decreased. Basal area increase was greatest in stands having 988 crop trees per hectare (400/acre), and as stocking decreased, basal area and volume growth decreased. An initial stocking of 988 eastern redcedar crop trees per hectare (400/acre), averaging about 7.6 cm (3 in) d.b.h., produced over 28 m³/ha (2,000 fbm/acre) in 10 years. A stocking of 432 trees per hectare (175/acre), averaging 10.2 cm (4 in) d.b.h., produced slightly more volume during the same period on similar sites (11). On most sites eastern redcedar grows slowly, and long rotations are required to produce conventional sawlogs. Because the wood is used for small items, however, and there is wide latitude in acceptable defects, shortening of rotations and intermediate harvesting of merchantable wood are possible. About 20 to 30 years are required for posts and 40 to 60 years for sawtimber (11,25). Maintaining relatively dense stands can maximize post production. Thinning one or more times before harvest cut hastens sawlog production but may not increase total yield. The ideal density for growing sawlogs is not known, but excessive thinning may promote excessive formation of sapwood and growth of lower branches. Rooting Habit- On shallow and rocky soils, eastern redcedar roots are very fibrous and tend to spread widely. Even first-year seedlings begin developing a long fibrous root system, often at the expense of top growth (15). If soil conditions permit, eastern redcedar trees develop a deep, penetrating taproot. Root development is greatly influenced by the size of soil-filled fissures. Eastern redcedar roots are known to grow extensively in soils in which limestone rocks make up more than 52 percent of the total soil volume (11). Reaction to Competition- Eastern redcedar has been classified as intolerant to very intolerant of shade (11,30), but trees that have lived for decades beneath a full canopy of hardwoods or pines on medium- to low-quality sites have been observed. Apparently, eastern redcedar has an inherent low capacity for water loss and the ability to sustain stomatal opening at low water potentials, which help the species adapt to dry environments (4). Eastern redcedar can also conduct photosynthesis when overstory hardwoods are leafless and perhaps even reduces its light requirements for photosynthesis by adjusting to shaded conditions (17,24). Eastern redcedar is a pioneer species on surface-mined areas, old fields, or pastures that are protected from fire; and it is the primary natural reproduction in many shelterbelts. However, stands formed through invasion of old fields may deteriorate at around 60 years of age as hardwoods or other competing species become established. Eastern redcedar grows well and faster than associated species because it is sun-adapted, drought-resistant, and has a long growing season. On most sites, eastern redcedar is temporary and is eventually replaced by more tolerant hardwoods and pines. However, clusters of eastern redcedar established beneath hardwoods have survived longer than the competing hardwood trees, possibly due to an allelopathic effect, or the species may be a better competitor for water and nutrients (34). The species is more permanent on poor sites having thin, rocky soils, such as the glades of the Ozarks of Missouri and Arkansas and the Nashville Basin in central Tennessee. Eastern redcedar invasion of pastures is a problem on areas converted from poor hardwood sites in the Ozarks and western areas of its range (9,31), and the species is likely to persist for a long time if left to grow (7). Eastern redcedar should be managed in even-aged stands, judging from studies conducted in northern Arkansas (11). Good growth rates can be maintained by controlling competition and stand densities. Damaging Agents- Fire is probably the worst enemy of eastern redcedar. The thin bark and roots near the ground surface are easily injured by fires. Some natural protection against fire exists because its foliage does not bum well and litter accumulation is minimal under stands on thin soils (11,15). Several insects damage eastern redcedar trees but rarely cause serious permanent damage (5). Roots of seedlings are very susceptible to attack by nematodes and grubs. The foliage is eaten by bagworms (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) and spruce spider mites (Oligonychus ununguis), both of which can completely defoliate trees. The eastern juniper bark beetle (Phloeosinus dentatus) attacks the species but usually does not kill trees except when the attack is associated with the root rot fungus, Heterobasidion annosum. Another bark beetle (Phloeosinus canadensis) may feed on eastern redcedar. Several boring insects, including the black-horned juniper borer (Callidium texanum), cedartree borer (Semanotus ligneus), cypress and cedar borer (Oeme rigida), and pales weevil (Hylobius pales) will attack eastern redcedar. The juniper midge (Contarinia juniperina) is a gall insect pest of redcedar which bores into the twigs at the base of needles and kills the portion beyond the entrance hole. In addition to pales weevil, two other weevils, the arborvitae weevil (Phyllobius intrusus) and the strawberry root weevil (Otiorhynchus ovatus), feed on roots of eastern redcedar. The latter two weevils are also leaf feeders, along with the juniper webworm (Dichomeris marginella); a wax moth (Coleotechnites juniperella); a leaf roller (Choristoneura houstonana), a pest of windbreak and ornamental plantings; and a sawfly (Monoctenus melliceps). The Fletcher scale (Lecanium fletcheri) and juniper scale (Carulaspis juniperi) are two other commonly occurring insects that attack junipers. Eastern redcedar, especially when weakened by stress or insects, is very susceptible to damage by the root rot fungus, Heterobasidion annosum. This disease is thought to cause the greatest damage over much of its range. Cubical rot fungi (Fomes subroseus and Daedalea juniperina) and juniper pocket rot fungus (Pyrofomes demidoffii) enter eastern redcedars through dead branch stubs and attack the heartwood. Several other minor heart-rot fungi infect eastern redcedar (21). The major stem and foliage diseases of eastern redcedar are fungi known as cedar rusts in the genus Gymnosporangium. The most commonly known and widely spread species is cedar apple rust (G. juniperi-virginianae), which attacks trees in all stages of development. Because it is an alternate host to this disease, the presence of redcedar is a problem to apple growers. Other common species are G. clavipes, G. globosum, G. effusum, and G. nidus-avis. The latter fungus is widely distributed and produces witches' brooms (21). Important foliage diseases include Phomopsis blight (Phomopsis juniperovora) and Cercospora sequoiae blight, which also attack seedlings. Phomopsis blight has been difficult to control in nurseries, but newer developments show promise (12,32). Both blights can cause major losses to eastern redcedar in the field, but Phomopsis blight is not a serious problem after seedlings reach age 4. Newly established seedlings are subject to frost-heaving, and foliage may occasionally be damaged by winter injury (23). Mice and rabbits may damage young eastern redcedar seedlings. Livestock generally avoid biting seedlings or trees but may trample the plants and their roots while grazing. During times of scarce food, deer will heavily browse eastern redcedar and destroy most reproduction (11,20). Redcedar withstands the weight of snow fairly well, but it has only moderate resistance to ice damage (8). Although the species is generally very tolerant to drought and temperature extremes, the author observed considerable mortality in west central Arkansas associated with the extremely hot, dry summer of 1980.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,14,1
"Eastern redcedar grows on a wide variety of soils, ranging from dry rock outcrops to wet swampy land (15). The most common soils fall within the soil orders Mollisols and Ultisols. No attempt will be made here to describe all of them. Like most species, eastern redcedar grows best on deep, moist, well-drained alluvial sites, where its height may reach 17 to 18 m (55 to 60 ft) in 50 years. On the better sites, however, hardwood competition is so severe that the species rarely becomes dominant. Eastern redcedar also grows well on deep, upland soils, particularly abandoned farmland. A 0.4-hectare (1-acre) plantation established in Arkansas from wildlings, with spacing of 1.8 by 1.8 m (6 by 6 ft), yielded a basal area of 37.4 m²/ha (163 ft²/acre) and an estimated 196 m³/ha (2,800 ft³/acre) of merchantable volume in 44 years (11). The species is frequently associated with areas commonly called glades, characterized by thin rocky soils and intermittent rock outcrops; soil depth is difficult to determine because soil rock content and depth of rock fissures vary (11,16). Soils on the poorest glade sites are less than 30 cm (12 in) deep, medium sites are usually less than 61 cm (24 in) deep and have large crevices, and good sites have deeper soil. Arend and Collins (3) developed the site classification system shown in table 1. Eastern redcedar grows on soils that vary widely in acidity. Soils found in natural stands range in pH value from 4.7 to 7.8. Although the species will grow on sites that are slightly alkaline, it is not particularly tolerant to higher pH levels. Eastern redcedar is, in fact, among the least alkali-tolerant of drought-hardy trees and shrubs. Soils in eastern redcedar stands tend to become neutral or slightly alkaline because the high calcium content of the tree's foliage can change the pH of the surface soil in a relatively short time. This condition also increases earthworm activity, with an increase in incorporation of organic matter, a lower volume weight, and an increase in pore volume and infiltration rate (11,15). Eastern redcedar grows on ridgetops, varying slopes, and flat land and is frequently found on dry, exposed sites and abandoned fields. This aspect also influences eastern redcedar development. In the western part of its range, the species may be found on north-facing slopes and along streambanks where there is some protection from high temperatures and drought. Although the most desirable elevation is not clearly delineated, eastern redcedar is found most often growing between 30 m (100 ft) and 1070 m (3,500 ft). It is notably absent below the 30 m (100 ft) elevation zone in the southern and eastern parts of the species range (15,27).",Soils and Topography,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,15,1
"Eastern redcedar is important to wildlife. As an evergreen, it provides good nesting and roosting cover for many birds (18,39). Dense thickets provide good escape cover for deer, and the abundant foliage, although low in quality, provides emergency food for them during times of stress. Fruits are high in crude fat and crude fiber, moderate in calcium, and very high in total carbohydrates. Eastern redcedar fruits are eaten by many wildlife species, including waxwings, bobwhite, quail, ruffed grouse, pheasant, wild turkeys, rabbits, foxes, raccoons, skunks, opossums, and coyotes (20). Eastern redcedar is among the best trees for protecting soils from wind erosion and reducing the desiccating effects of wind. It ranks high in the Great Plains shelterbelt plantings because of its ability to withstand extremes of drought, heat, and cold (15). In Nebraska, eastern redcedar was the most suitable species among five combinations tested for single-row field windbreaks (42). The fibrous root system also helps to hold soil in place, especially on shallow soils. Many varieties of eastern redcedar are used as ornamental plantings (19,35). The species is also ranked among the top five for Christmas trees (25). Eastern redcedar is also important as a source of cedarwood oil, which is a natural product for direct use in fragrance compounding or as a source of raw material producing additional fragrance compounds (1).",Special Uses,Eastern Redcedar,juniperus,virginiana,conifer,16,1
"White pine is a major component of five Society of American Foresters forest cover types (70): Red Pine (Type 15), White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple (Type 20), Eastern White Pine (Type 21), White Pine-Hemlock (Type 22), White Pine-Chestnut Oak (Type 51). None of these are climax types, although the White Pine-Hemlock type may just precede the climax hemlock types, and Type 20 is very close to a climax or an alternating type of climax on the sandy outwash plains of New England (42). White pine occurs in 23 other forest types: 1 Jack Pine 5 Balsam Fir 14 Northern Pin Oak 18 Paper Birch 19 Gray Birch-Red Maple 23 Eastern Hemlock 24 Hemlock-Yellow Birch 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 26 Sugar Maple-Basswood 30 Red Spruce-Yellow Birch 31 Red Spruce-Sugar Maple-Beech 32 Red Spruce 33 Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 35 Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 37 Northern White-Cedar 39 Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple 44 Chestnut Oak 45 Pitch Pine 53 White Oak 57 Yellow-Poplar 59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak 60 Beech-Sugar Maple 108 Red Maple White pine also grows with pitch pine (Pinus rigida), jack pine (P. banksiana), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), sweet birch (Betula lenta), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), quaking aspen (P. tremuloides), black cherry (Prunus serotina), black oak (Quercus velutina), white oak (Q. alba), and various hickories (Carya spp.). The ground vegetation in a white pine stand varies greatly, as evidenced by the number of forest cover types in which it is a major or minor component. Beneath pure or nearly pure stands of white pine, understory plants usually are sparse compared to those in the pine-hardwood mixtures (70). In general, on dry sites the understory vegetation is usually of one or more species of blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (Diervilla lonicera), sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), clubmoss (Lycopodium spp.), and broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus). The moist, rich sites support a ground vegetation made up principally of several species of woodsorrel (Oxalis), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema spp.), and hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula). Intermediate sites have ground vegetation containing various amounts of the above with dogwood (Cornus spp.) and false lily- of-the -valley (Maianthemum canadense).",Associated Forest Cover,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,1,1
"The climate over the range of white pine is cool and humid. The distribution of white pine coincides reasonably with that part of eastern North America where the July temperature averages between 18° and 23° C (65° and 74° F). Annual precipitation ranges from about 510 mm (20 in) in northern Minnesota to about 2030 mm (80 in) in northwestern Georgia. In the area surrounding the Great Lakes, about two-thirds of the precipitation occurs during the warm season, April to September. Elsewhere, half of the precipitation occurs during the warm season. The length of the growing season ranges from 90 to 180 days. Throughout the range of white pine, precipitation is about 1 to 1.5 times the evaporation from shaded free water surfaces (71). Annual potential evapo- transpiration is between 430 and 710 mm. (17 and 28 in), of which 56 to 68 percent occurs in the warm season. There is a moisture surplus in all seasons. Average depth of frost penetration ranges from about 25 cm (10 in) in the southern Appalachians to more than 178 cm (70 in) in parts of central and northern Minnesota. Average annual snowfall ranges from 13 cm (5 in) in northern Georgia to more than 254 cm (100 in) in New England and southern Canada (51).",Climate,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,2,1
"Eastern white pine is represented in the United States by the typical variety, Pinus strobus var. strobus. Chiapas white pine, P. strobus var. chiapensis, is native in the mountains of southern Mexico and Guatemala. Four horticultural varieties have been recognized in Connecticut (68). Eastern white pine crosses readily with western white pine (Pinus monticola), Balkan pine (P. peuce), blue pine (P. griffithii), and Japanese white pine (P. parviflora). It can also be crossed with limber pine (P. flexilis) and Mexican white pine (P. ayacahuite) (21). The cross P. strobus x griffithii is more vigorous than P. strobus in Northern Ohio and more winter hardy than P. griffithii (37).",Hybrids,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,9,1
"Eastern white pine is found across southern Canada from Newfoundland, Anticosti Island, and Gaspé peninsula of Quebec; west to central and western Ontario and extreme southeastern Manitoba; south to southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa; east to northern Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; and south mostly in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and northwestern South Carolina. It is also found in western Kentucky, western Tennessee, and Delaware. A variety grows in the mountains of southern Mexico and Guatemala. - The native range of eastern white pine.",Native Range,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,11,1
"Early provenance tests by the USDA Forest Service and by Genys showed that trees from the southern Appalachians grew more rapidly at a number of test locations. In a followup test, Wright and others collected 177 seedlots from the southern Appalachians. After 12 years, the trees from Georgia and parts of North Carolina and Tennessee grew most rapidly and trees from West Virginia and Maryland grew most slowly wherever they were tested. There are geographic differences in air pollution sensitivity, flower production, winter injury, and susceptibility to blister rust (4,27,35,73). White pine varies greatly in appearance in different parts of its range, suggesting that unidentified ecological or geographical races may exist (32). Likewise, trees immune to white pine blister rust and weevil occur, suggesting the feasibility of selection propagation and breeding of resistant varieties (72).",Population Differences,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- White pine is monoecious. The male strobili are oval, 8 to 10 mm (0.3 to 0.4 in) long and occur mostly on the basal part of new shoots and mostly on older lateral branches in the lower crown. At the time of pollen shed, they are light brown to brown. Female flowers are found most often in the upper crown, primarily at the apical end of the main branches in the position of subterminal or lateral buds (39). At the time of pollination, they are green, and 5 to 38 mm (0.2 to 1.5 in) long. In the northeastern United States, flowering occurs between May and June. The male flowers develop from one to several weeks before the female flowers. Trees may start to bear female flowers when 5 to 10 years old (71). In the Philadelphia area, quantity production of female flowers does not begin until the trees are about 6 m (20 ft) tall. At that size, 200 to 300 flowers may be produced in 1 year; the number is only a little greater on larger or older trees. Few or no male flowers appear during the early flowering years. Femaleness persists even on older trees 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in diameter, although trees of this size do produce small to moderate amounts of pollen (71). The pattern of flowering in white pine is uncertain. In the Philadelphia area, the better flowering trees tend to produce about the same number of female flowers every year, with some exceptions; male flowers, however, do not appear every year (71). Fertilization occurs about 13 months after pollination, and cones mature usually during August and September of the second year (39). Trees have borne cones at 5 to 10 years of age, but good seed production cannot be expected until the trees are 20 to 30 years old (30). Seed Production and Dissemination- Good seed years are thought to occur every 3 to 5 years, a few seeds being produced in most intervening years. However, at the Massabesic Experimental Forest in southwestern Maine, and at other New England locations, there was virtually no seed produced for 7 years and no good seed crop for 10 years. The major cause of these failures probably is the white pine cone beetle (Conophthorus coniperda). Cones are green when immature and turn yellow-green to light brown when ripe. Cones that float in linseed oil are considered ripe. Cones should be collected from trees having superior growth and form. Widely spaced dominant trees with full crowns produce the most seeds per cone (39). In a comprehensive German study of white pine seed production, it was found that a 90-year-old stand produced about 73 kg of seeds per hectare (65 lb/acre); a comparable 60-year-old stand produced only one-fifth as much. In these stands, dominant trees produced twice as many cones as codominant trees (71). In Maine, intermediate density stands 27.6 m²/ha (120 ft²/acre) produced 4,430,000 viable seeds per hectare (1,793,220/acre) in a good seed year (29). In high density stands 42.9 m²/ha (187 ft²/acre), seedfall was 36 percent less and in low density stands 18.4 m²/ha (80 ft²/acre), seedfall was 30 percent less than in the intermediate density stands. There are 58,400 seeds per kilogram (26,500/1b) with a range from 38,600 to 116,800/kg (17,500 to 53,000/1b) (39). In a study of 250 different parents from all parts of the white pine range, the number of good seeds per cone ranged from 0 to 73. The lowest sets were found in stands at the extremes of the range. Most of the seeds are dispersed within the month following cone maturity. The seeds travel at least 60 m (200 ft) within a white pine stand and more than 210 m (700 ft) in the open (71). Gray squirrels were found responsible for much of the white pine reproduction under mature red oak stands in southern New Hampshire; they bury and recover the seeds (3). Seedling Development- Embryo dormancy is common in white pine, and for nursery sowing, stratification of seeds for 60 days at 1° to 5° C (33° to 41° F) is recommended (39). Germination is epigeal. Bare mineral soil is not necessary for seed germination; seeds can germinate and survive on both disturbed and undisturbed litter layers (6). Under full exposure to sunlight, moist mineral soil, polytrichum moss, or a shortgrass cover of light to medium density are favorable seedbeds. Dry mineral soil, pine litter, lichen, and very thin or very thick grass covers are unfavorable (71). Unfavorable seedbed conditions can be corrected by scarification or can be overcome by shade. However, dense, low shade such as that cast by slash piles or hardwood brush is adverse to later survival and the shade of young stands of gray birch (Betula populifolia) or pitch pine reduces growth in the later stages. Overstory shade resulting from a form of shelterwood cut provides good protection during the early stages of growth and is least damaging to later stages (71). Experience in North Carolina shows that during years of heavy seedfall white pine seedlings develop well in shade cast by logging debris. Some seedlings may die during a hot dry June, however. Thus, the roughest tracts are reserved and regenerated by natural methods during years of high seedfall only (52). On medium to fair sites in the central Appalachians, white pine seedlings can be underplanted in hardwood stands with reasonable success (69). The hardwoods, mostly oaks and hickories, permit enough light to reach the seedlings so some height growth occurs. Normally 3 to 5 years are required for white pine to become established, and if the pines are released 5 to 10 years later, a high proportion outgrow the competing vegetation. Similar results have been reported for 9- to 20-year-old underplanted white pine in Maine, Canada, and South Carolina (16,28,71). White pine seedlings in the vicinity of recent pine timber cuttings often are attacked by the pales weevil (Hylobius pales). This insect breeds in the fresh stumps and slash; nearby seedlings are girdled and usually killed. Most of the damage occurs during the first 3 years after a cutting and among seedlings less than 5 years old (71). After the establishment period, light intensity becomes critical to the survival and growth of white pine seedlings. At light intensities less than 10 to 13 percent of full sunlight, survival is uniformly poor; at least 20 percent of full sunlight seems to be required to keep the seedlings alive. As light intensity increases above this point, growth increases proportionately up to full sunlight unless some other condition becomes limiting (71). Diameter growth of planted white pine increased with increased light in clearcut stands in the Piedmont of South Carolina (23). Height growth of underplanted seedlings after 2 years did not differ from that of seedlings planted in a clearcut. Although young seedlings can survive for several weeks in soils with moisture below the wilting coefficient, growth at a given light intensity is best in the absence of root competition; growth is better when only an overstory offers root competition than when both an understory and an overstory are competing (71). Mineral soil seedbeds plus light intensities greater than 20 percent full sunlight but less than full sunlight support vigorous seedling growth by reducing surface soil temperatures and providing better soil moisture conditions (41). The survival of white pine 2-2 stock was increased on shallow old pasture soils in eastern Ontario when wedge-shaped pieces of peat saturated with water were placed at the bottom of the planting holes to provide water and prevent desiccation during drought periods (61). Two-O stock stored in a refrigerator can be planted until mid-June without significant reduction in survival rate. However, seedlings planted in July and August will not be hardened off by the first fall frost (56). In some early greenhouse and nursery trials with young seedlings, the optimum supply of nitrogen was shown to be 300 p/m; phosphorus, 350 p/m; potassium, 150 p/m; and calcium, 200 p/m (71). Early white pine growth is slow. Open-grown trees are about 13 cm (5 in) high when 3 years old; 30 cm (12 in) high when 5 years old; and 137 cm (54 in) high when 8 to 10 years old. Thereafter, height growth may be quite rapid. Between 10 and 20 years old, open-grown dominant trees have grown as much as 137 cm (54 in) in height in a single year. Annual increments of 91 cm (36 in) are not uncommon, but average height growth of dominant trees during this period is about 41 cm (16 in) (71). Usually terminal growth occurs within a 30-day period (6) and normally is completed by July 1 (56). Vegetative Reproduction- White pine does not reproduce vegetatively under natural conditions (31). Small cuttings of the last season's twigs, taken in late winter from trees 2 to 6 years old, root fairly readily, however. Within 9 years, outplanted cuttings have developed the same form and size as seedlings, and the root system approaches that of seedlings (71). Also, trees from rooted cuttings performed as well or better than seedling-origin trees when comparing survival, height, and d.b.h. after 40 years (62). When June-collected cuttings from 17- and 30-year-old white pine were treated with 0.1 percent indolebutyric acid (IBA) and the fungicide Benlate, 60 and 45 percent, respectively, all of the cuttings produced roots in 16 weeks (36). Cuttings from secondary branches of 13-year-old white pines treated with 5 percent benomyl and 25 percent captan fungicides resulted in root formation on 36 percent of the cuttings. When 0.1 percent or 0.5 percent IBA was added, rooting was 31 percent (64). Multi-applications of N6 benzyladenine at 1,000 p/m to white pine needle fascicles produced roots on 22 percent of all clones tested in 1975 (17). Scions from the crown of mature trees can be grafted on young stock (31). Side grafts of scions on 3- or 4-year-old white pine stocks seem to be a more reliable method of vegetative propagation than rooted cuttings (71). Buds from main terminal or lateral terminal positions should be used in grafting if early erect growth is desired (1).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- White pine is a long-lived tree commonly reaching 200 years if undisturbed; maximum age may exceed 450 years. It has a remarkable rate of growth compared to other pine and hardwood species within its range (20). Trees 102 cm (40 in) in d.b.h. and 46 m (150 ft) tall were common in the virgin forests of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New England (71). In the ""National Register of Big Trees"" (54), there are two champion white pines: one in Michigan is 168 cm (66 in) in diameter and 48.2 m (158 ft) tall, and the other in Maine is 173 cm (68 in) in diameter and 44.8 m (147 ft) tall. Periodic height growth increment of dominant and codominant trees in southern Appalachian natural white pine stands occurs at younger ages on the better sites and tends to decline more rapidly. Height growth of both planted and natural white pine is slow during the first 2 to 3 years. Afterwards, growth accelerates rapidly, peaking at an average annual rate of 1 m (3 ft) between 10 and 15 years on site index 80 (base 50 years) (6). By age 55, the rate of annual growth is about equal on all sites (9). For example, in stands with a site index of 36.6 m (120 ft), maximum growth of 1.0 m (3.4 ft) per year occurred at age 14; whereas, with a site index of 18.3 m (60 ft), maximum growth of 0.5 m (1.5 ft) per year did not occur until age 23. By age 55, however, annual growth for all sites was about 0.3 m (1.0 ft) per year (fig. 1). Figure 1-Curves of annual increment (A) and cumulative height (B) for selected site indices. These curves show the changing pattern of growth with level of site index (9). Diameter growth may be as rapid as 2.5 cm (1 in) per year or as slow as 2.5 cm (1 in) in 40 years. Dominant trees ordinarily grow at the rate of 1 to 2 rings per 5 mm (5 to 10/in) to an age of 250 years. In fully stocked stands on average sites, the average tree diameter increases at a nearly uniform rate of 2.5 cm (1 in) every 5 to 6 years (71). Generally, rates of growth in basal area, cubic volume, and sawtimber volume in natural southern Appalachian stands tend to be slower than those in old-field plantations. For example, maximum mean annual increment in cubic volume occurs at 60 to 70 years in natural stands and at about 25 years in plantations. Similarly, sawtimber volume in natural stands is still increasing at 100 years, though very slowly. In New England stands, mean annual increment in cubic volume occurs at age 40 to 50 (8). Sustained cubic volume growth extends from about age 30 to 90. Mean annual growth peaks at 8.6 m/ha (615.0 fbm/acre). In New England, a stocking guide for white pine has been prepared (55) (fig. 2). Figure 2-Stocking guide for nearly pure even-aged white pine stands, showing basal area per acre, number of trees per acre, and mean d.b.h. for trees in the main crown canopy (55). The A curve represents 80 percent stocking, and stands above it are considered overstocked. The B curve represents minimum stocking for full site utilization and stands that fall below are considered understocked. Stands between the A and B curves are considered adequately stocked. Where a particular stand might fall in the guide is based on basal area per acre, number of trees per acre, and mean d.b.h. for trees in the main canopy. Tables have been prepared for different stand ages, site and stocking percent, and cubic and sawtimber yield (table 1) (43). Yields of about 504 m³/ha (36,000 fbm/acre) at 50 years in nearly fully stocked managed stands are entirely possible. The average white pine stand in New England grows from 4.2 to 11.2 m³/ha (300 to 800 fbm/acre) per year depending on age, site index, and stocking (41). Site index for eastern white pine is determined from the average height of dominant trees at age 50 years. For more detailed information, refer to publications on the growth and yield of white pine in natural stands and plantations prepared specifically for the various parts of the range (6,10,41,49,55,57). Rooting Habit- The form and distribution of the white pine root system vary with the soil characteristics. The normal root system has just a vestige of a taproot. Usually three to five large roots spread outward and downward in the soil, giving the tree a firm anchor under most conditions. In deep, coarse-textured soils, sinker roots that branch from the laterals and grow straight down seem to be fairly common, but they are seldom found in other soils. A concentration of fine roots within the H, A, and B horizons seems to be greatest where the soil is fine textured, with good structure and consistency, and a relatively high moisture equivalent (71). A high total exchange capacity and a relatively high content of exchangeable bases, total nitrogen, and organic matter also favor the concentration of roots. Much root grafting occurs in white pine stands (12). Regardless of either stand age, soil characteristics, or drainage class, root grafting occurred in 30 to 67 percent of dye-injected trees in five white pine stands in New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Exposure of the root systems indicated that often several trees, rather than two or three, were united by root grafts. Root grafting indicates that competition may be a factor in white pine growth for the first 5 to 10 years of a stand. Thereafter, root grafts begin to form, and the stand may function as a union of grafted trees interspersed with individual trees. Reaction to Competition- White pine is intermediate in shade tolerance, and vegetative competition is a major problem (60). Although it will tolerate up to 80 percent shade, tree growth increases as shade is reduced (6). It can achieve maximum height growth in as little as 45 percent full sunlight (60). In competition with light-foliaged species such as the birches and pitch pine, white pine usually gains dominance in the stand. It can grow successfully in competition with black walnut (15). Against the stronger competition of species such as the aspens, oaks, and maples, however, white pine usually fails to gain a place in the upper canopy and eventually dies (71). Pure stands of white pine seldom stagnate because of inherent variations in vigor. This characteristic is more pronounced on better sites and in natural stands than in plantations (6). In Ontario, on upland sites white pine and its associates are rated in decreasing order of shade tolerance as follows: balsam fir (Abies balsamea), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), white spruce (Picea glauca), yellow birch, white pine, black spruce (Picea mariana), gray birch (Betula populifolia), red oak Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), red pine (Pinus resinosa), jack pine, trembling aspen, bigtooth aspen, and pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) (71). In the seedling stage, white pine is very susceptible to competition because its height growth is slow compared to most of its associates. If white pine survives to the sapling stage, its ability to compete is greatly improved (71). At either stage, the response to release depends primarily on how strong the competition has been and how long the pine has been in a subordinate position. In general, pines less than 30 years old with at least one-third of their height in live crown respond well, but response declines proportionately with increasing age and decreasing crown length. White pine may function as a pioneer, as exemplified by its role as the old field pine of New England. It may function as a physiographic climax species on the drier, sandier soils. It may function as a long-lived successional species, and it may be a component of climax forests throughout its range. In Canada, however, it is considered that many of the present white pine stands are edaphic or pyric relicts and that present climatic conditions are against its maintenance as a major species (71). Pure natural stands of white pine almost never stagnate. Because of differences in vigor, age, and site, differentiation into crown and diameter classes usually occurs. Dominance is more pronounced on the better sites, at the greater stand densities, and in natural stands as compared to plantations (71). White pine has been regenerated successfully by a wide variety of methods including clearcutting, seed tree, shelterwood, and group selection (44). If there is abundant advanced reproduction, overstory removal is all that is necessary. Clearcutting during or just after heavy seed crops often results in well stocked stands on light soils. Clearcutting in small patches or stands with seed dispersed from adjacent stands is also possible. Because of competition from other vegetation and poor seed crops, mechanical site preparation and planting may be necessary sometimes in conjunction with clearcutting. Where esthetic considerations are important, group selection may have merit. Probably the most versatile reproduction method is the shelterwood method. By control of overstory density with a series of shelterwood cuts, seedbed conditions may be improved; an accumulation of advanced seedlings is obtained over a period of years; protection of seedlings on hot, dry aspects is afforded; weevil attacks are reduced; and competition from herbaceous and hardwood sprout vegetation is suppressed. Two, three, or more cuts spread over a number of years may be used, but usually white pine can be regenerated successfully with a two-cut shelterwood system. Seed cuts should be timed to take advantage of good seed crops, but timing of the final cut is not critical. Trees in pure second-growth stands of white pine are noted for their limbiness. The limbs live for about 15 years and persist on the trunk for more than 25 years after they die. In the first log of these stands, there is an average of about 60 limbs (71). Pruning has been recommended to increase quality production. If possible, pruning should begin early when branches are less than 5 cm (2 in) in diameter but not before dominance is expressed. At least 25 percent of the live crown and up to 50 percent in closed stands can be pruned without losses in height growth. To realize full benefits of pruning, only potential crop trees should be pruned and stands should be thinned to maximize growth (24). In Canada, pruning is recommended on fast-growing trees in stands 35 to 80 years old because of the inefficiency of pruning smaller trees and the lengthened rotation and probable growth reduction in older stands (34). This recommendation assumes that the highest returns will accrue if the trees are allowed to grow for another 40 years before harvest. Damaging Agents- There are a total of 277 insects and 110 disease organisms known to attack white pine. Only 16 insects and 7 diseases cause sufficient injury or mortality to be of concern. The three most important are white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi), white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and Armillaria mellea (63). The white pine weevil kills the terminal shoot, which may include the last 2 or 3 years of growth. The tree is seldom killed unless it is very small; lateral branches from the highest live whorl turn upward to produce new terminal shoots. Bole crook and loss of stem length result from this injury (71). There is evidence that white pine provenances differ in resistance to weevils but even the lowest levels of injury are unacceptable (25). Among other insect enemies are white pine aphid (Cinara strobi), which causes damage to twigs and branches of large trees and sometimes kills small trees; white pine sawfly (Neodiprion pinetum), which feeds on old and new foliage; Zimmerman pine moth (Dioryctria zimmermani); the Allegheny mound ant (Formica exsectoides), which injects formic acid into the tree tissue; pales weevil (Hylobius pales), which feeds on bark of young twigs and seedlings; pine root collar weevil (H. radicis); European pine shoot moth (Rhyacionia buoliana), which feeds on buds and twigs causing crooked trunks and branches; eastern pine shoot borer (Eucosma gloriola), which attacks terminal needle sheaths, often causing bushiness after repeated attacks; introduced pine sawfly (Diprion similis), which feeds on foliage and may defoliate an entire tree in one season; and white pine cone borer (Eucosma tocullionana), which feeds on white pine cones and is a potentially serious pest (5). White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) is highly virulent throughout the range of white pine. Trees are susceptible from the seedling stage through maturity. Blister rust can cause high losses both in regeneration and in immature timber stands (71). Red ring rot caused by Phellinus pini is the most important heart rot of white pine. The fungus enters through wounds, dead limbs, or tips killed by weevils. Losses are greater in older trees but do not build up rapidly. Haematostereum sanguinolentum, a wound parasite, is probably the third most destructive fungus associated with white pine. It usually enters through pruning wounds (71). Phaeolus schweinitzii causes one of the most common and destructive root rots. A root rot caused by Heterobasidion annosum is found particularly on white pines growing on poorly aerated soils. Thinnings appear to increase the incidence of this disease (71). Armillaria mellea destroys much of the white pine seedling and sapling reproduction for distances up to 9 m (30 ft) from hardwood stumps. The fungus radiates and girdles pines at the root collar and causes resinosis (33). Other root rots that attack white pine are Inonotus tomentosus and Scytinostroma galactinium. Many fungi invade white pine foliage. The most serious damage is caused by Bifusella linearis, which attacks first-year needles; Scirrhia acicola, which can cause spring shedding of all needles; and Capnodium pini, which causes surface sooty mold on aphid secretions on needles. Three categories of nursery diseases are pre-emergence and post-emergence damping off, most commonly caused by Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium spp., Pythium debaryanum, P. ultimum, and Phytophthora cinnamomi; damping off and root collar rot caused by the preceding fungi and Cylindrocladium scoparium and Diplodia pinea; and foliage and succulent stem blights caused by Cylindrocladium scoparium, Diplodia pinea, Phacidium infestans, and Rhizina undulata. In the field, seedlings may be attacked by Armillaria mellea and by most of the fungi observed in the nursery. In 3- to 10-year-old plantations in Pennsylvania, Verticicladiella procera was identified (65). The bark on exposed roots and the stem in second-growth white pine stands is thin, and fire resistance is low. Losses invariably are heavy after a fire, with mortality continuing for several years. Also, fire injury is probably responsible for introducing disease agents. If fires occurred more frequently than once in 10 years, white pine reproduction might be eliminated (53). Old trees have thicker bark and are at least moderately resistant to fire. The species is relatively windfirm. if permitted full development, but in dense stands, wind damage may be expected from an occasional severe storm, particularly after a recent partial cutting (71). Wind-deformed trees are subject to later compression failures in the bole. Also, white pine is damaged by deer browsing; ice and snow, which often cause limb and stem breakage; sulfur dioxide in stack gases resulting from large scale burning of coal and oil refining; fluorine gas from brick kilns; atmospheric ozone; and sea-salt spray (11,26,33,58).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,14,1
"The major soil orders found in the white pine range are Inceptisols, Ultisols, Spodosols, Entisols, and Alfisols (14,50,66). In New England the important subgroups are excessively drained or somewhat excessively drained sandy deposits or stratified sand and gravel deposits. Most of the parent materials are glaciofluvial deposits-subgroups Typic Udorthents, Typic Haplorthods, and Typic Udipsamments; glacial tills-subgroups Lithic Dystrochrepts and Lithic Haplorthods; or weathered igneous rocks (loose crystalline fragments mainly from weathered Conway granite)-subgroup Lithic Haplorthods (42). In northern Minnesota, Eutroboralfs, Haplorthods, Udipsamments, and Hapludalfs are among the most common of the great groups (2). They are similar to the soils of New England and are more or less freely drained and have developed on glacial outwash or till material. Dystrochrepts, Fragiodults, and Normudults are the major great groups occupied by white pine in the central Appalachian Mountains (45). These soils are weathered from acid shales and sandstones, either in place (residual soils), deposited on lower slopes (colluvial material), or along stream terraces (alluvial material). The soils are generally well drained and have a coarse loamy to a fine loamy texture. Soils within the range of white pine are derived from granites, gneisses, schists, and sandstones, and less commonly from phyllites, slates, shales, and limestones. In the northern part of the Lake States and southern Canada, white pine is usually confined to soils derived from basalts, gabbro, diabase, and granites (70). Most of the area was covered by the Wisconsin glaciation so the soils are young and have weakly developed profiles (67). In New Hampshire, white pine is found on granite-derived soils and on metamorphic crystalline schists (42). From central Pennsylvania south and in southwestern Wisconsin, the soils are much older, generally are finer textured, and have well developed profiles. White pine grows on nearly all the soils within its range (71), but generally competes best on well drained sandy soils of low to medium site quality. These soils permit fair growth of white pine but not hardwoods. On these sandy sites, white pine regenerates naturally, competes easily, and can be managed most effectively and economically (40,47). On medium-textured soils (sandy loams), it will outproduce most other native commercial species in both volume and value (47). White pine also grows on fine sandy loams and silt-loam soils with either good or impeded drainage when there is no hardwood competition during the establishment period-as on old fields and pastures, bums, and blowdowns. It has been found on clay soils and on poorly drained or very poorly drained soils with surface mounds. It can be very productive on these sites but usually occurs only as individual trees or in small groups (47). This pine should not be planted in heavy clay soils. Poorly drained bottom land sites and upland depressions are also poor choices for planting (6). At various places within white pine's range, site quality has been related to combinations of soil and topographic characteristics such as texture and thickness of the A and B horizons, depth and permeability of the underlying rock or pan, depth to the water table, natural drainage class, topographic position, slope percent, and aspect. In the unglaciated regions of Ohio and central Indiana, site quality for white pine increases as the soil becomes coarser in texture and declines as the moisture equivalent and wilting percentage increase in the A and B horizons (71). But thickness of the A horizon had the greatest influence on rate of growth. In Massachusetts white pine site quality increased with the increase in silt and clay fraction of the A horizon, with higher pH value of the B or C horizon, with increased stone and gravel fraction greater than 2 mm (0.08 in) in the A horizon, with greater nitrogen content in the A horizon, and with higher percent organic matter in the B horizon (46). In general, the higher site indices are associated with the poor soil drainage classes. On reclaimed soils, white pine should not be planted on sites with a pH of less than 4.0 (6). In New Hampshire, the average height of dominant and codominant trees increased as the soil tended to be less well drained (7,71). Site productivity in Maine showed the following responses: increase with a reduction in soil drainage; increase with pH increases in surface mineral horizons; decrease with increased content of stones larger than 0.6 cm. (0.25 in) in the C horizon, but increase with the contents of stones in surface horizon; increase with thickness of the A horizon; increase with soil depth to a bulk density of 1.40 or greater; increase with increasing availability of soil moisture in the upper 76 cm (30 in) of soil (59). In the southern part of its range, white pine grows best on soils along rivers and streams and grows somewhat more slowly on well drained sites (22). The growth of white pine in plantations in eastern Tennessee was found to decrease with increased plasticity of the B horizon (71). Pine often grows better than some of its associates on poor soils or sites, such as in northeastern Iowa where white pine was 8 site index points better than oaks on the poor soils (71). In a comparison of site index and growth of 10 species in the southern Appalachians, white pine exceeded all species in growth, except on the best sites, where yellow-poplar outranked it in height only. In New England, white pine frequently pioneers on abandoned agricultural land but only on the well-drained to excessively drained deposits-outwash, sandy tills, and shallow bedrock. White pine may form part of the climax (edaphic) on the driest of these materials or may alternate with oak (42). In New England and New York, white pine generally grows at elevations between sea level and 460 m (1,500 ft), occasionally higher. In Pennsylvania, the elevation ranges from 150 to 610 m (500 to 2,000 ft) (71). In the southern Appalachians, white pine grows in a band along the mountains between 370 and 1070 m (1,200 and 3,500 ft) above sea level, occasionally reaching 1220 m (4,000 ft). In Pennsylvania and the southern Appalachians, most white pine is found on northerly aspects, in coves, and on stream bottoms. Elsewhere, aspect seldom restricts its occurrence (71).",Soils and Topography,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,15,1
"Although the genus Pinus is used by wildlife for food and cover, few specific observations of eastern white pine have been noted. Some species of songbirds that consume seeds of white pine are the yellow-bellied sapsucker, black-capped chickadee, white-breasted nuthatch, pine warbler, pine grosbeak, and the red crossbill. Some mammals that eat seeds, bark, and foliage of white pine are beaver, snowshoe hares, New England cottontails, porcupine, red and gray squirrels, mice, and white-tailed deer (48). White pines are useful in urban plantings. Trees grown from seeds obtained in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, or in adjacent regions of New Brunswick, Maine, and New Hampshire may be more suitable than trees obtained from other regions (27). They usually have more compact crowns and are more resistant to snowbreak; they grow more slowly, have darker blue-green color, and seem to be more resistant to air pollutants than trees from other origins. White pine has been used extensively for stabilizing strip-mine spoils. In the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, white pine survived well on spoils that fell within the pH range 5.1 to 6.5, and growth was better on lower slopes of the spoils than on upper slopes (18). On bituminous spoils in West Virginia, white pine survived best on spoils having a pH greater than 4.0 (13). Growth on the spoils was slow for the first 5 years, but total height exceeded that of Scotch pine (P. sylvestris), and red pine at 10 years. The bark of white pine is used as an astringent and an expectorant, and the wood has been used to produce white pine tar, which is used as an antiseptic, expectorant, and protective (38). White pine wood has medium strength, is easily worked, and stains and finishes well. It is used for furniture, patterns, matches, and many other items. White pine is also planted for Christmas trees. The foliage has a good color and responds well to shearing (19).",Special Uses,Eastern White Pine,pinus,strobus,conifer,16,1
"Engelmann spruce most typically grows together with subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) to form the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206) forest cover type. It may also occur in pure or nearly pure stands. Spruce grows in 15 other forest types recognized by the Society of American Foresters, usually as a minor component or in frost pockets (95): 201 White Spruce 205 Mountain Hemlock 208 Whitebark Pine 209 Bristlecone Pine 210 Interior Douglas-Fir 212 Western Larch 213 Grand Fir 215 Western White Pine 216 Blue Spruce 217 Aspen 218 Lodgepole Pine 219 Limber Pine 224 Western Hemlock 226 Coastal True Fir-Hemlock 227 Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock The composition of the forest in which Engelmann spruce grows is influenced by elevation, exposure, and latitude (30). In the Rocky Mountains and Cascades, subalpine fir is its common associate at all elevations. In the northernmost part of its range along the Coast Range and in the Rocky Mountains of Canada, it mixes with white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (Picea mariana), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera). In the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho, in the Cascades, and in the mountains of eastern Washington and Oregon, associates at lower and middle elevations are western white pine (Pinus monticola), Douglas-fir, western larch (Larix occidentalis), grand fir (Abies grandis), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta); associates at higher elevations are Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), alpine larch (Larix lyallii), and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). In the Rocky Mountains south of Montana and Idaho, and in the mountains of Utah, lodgepole pine, interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), blue spruce (Picea pungens), white-fir (Abies concolor), aspen (Populus tremuloides), and occasionally ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis), are common associates at lower and middle elevations, and corkbark fir (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica), limber pine (Pinus flexilis), and bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) at high elevations. Engelmann spruce extends to timberline in the Rocky Mountains south of Idaho and Montana, and may form pure stands at timberline in the southernmost part of its range. In the Canadian Rockies of southwestern Alberta and adjacent British Columbia and into the Rocky Mountains north of Wyoming and Utah, and the Cascades, spruce usually occupies moist sites below timberline; its high-elevation associates form timberline forests (6,20). Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum) (warm, moist sites); twinflower (Linnaea borealis), (cool, moist sites); common creeping juniper (Juniperus communis) (warm, dry sites); and grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium), heartleaf arnica (Arnica cordifolia), boxleaf myrtle (Pachistima myrsinites), elk sedge (Carex geyeri), mountain gooseberry (Ribes montigenum), and fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) (cool, dry sites) occur as undergrowth throughout much of the range of Engelmann spruce. Undergrowth vegetation is more variable than tree associates, however. Undergrowth characteristically found in the Pacific Northwest Region and the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges north of Utah and Wyoming include: Labrador-tea (Ledum glandulosum), Cascades azalea (Rhododendron albiflorum), rusty skunkbrush (Menziesia ferruginea), woodrush (Luzula hitchcockii), dwarf huckleberry (Vaccinium cespitosum), and blue huckleberry (Vaccinium globulare), (cool, moist sites); false solomons-seal (Smilacina stellata), queenscup beadlily (Clintonia uniflora), twistedstalk (Streptopus amplexifolius), and sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum) (warm, moist sites); pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens) and beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax) (cool, dry sites); Oregongrape (Berberis repens), white spires, (Spiraea betulifolia), and big whortleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) (warm, dry sites); and marsh-marigold (Caltha leptosepala), devilsclub (Oplopanax horridum), and bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) (wet sites) (14,39). Undergrowth characteristically found in the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges south of Idaho and Montana include: mountain bluebells (Mertensia ciliata) and heartleaf bittercress (Cardamine cordifolia) (cool, moist sites); thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus) (warm, moist sites); red buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis), Oregongrape, mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), and Arizona peavine (Lathyrus arizonicus) (warm, dry sites); and Rocky Mountain whortleberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), groundsel (Senecio sanguiosboides), polemonium (Polemonium delicatum), daisy fleabane (Erigeron eximius), prickly currant (Ribes lacustre), sidebells pyrola (Pyrola secunda), and mosses (cool, dry sites) (14).",Associated Forest Cover,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,1,1
"Engelmann spruce grows in a humid climate with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. It occupies one of the highest and coldest forest environments in the western United States, characterized by heavy snowfall and temperature extremes of more than -45.6° C (-50° F) to above 32.2° C (90° F). Climatic data for four subregions of the United States within the species range are given in table 1 (23,42,65,100). The range of mean annual temperatures is narrow considering the wide distribution of the species. Average annual temperatures are near freezing, and frost can occur any month of the year. Average precipitation exceeds 61 cm (24 in) annually, with only moderate or no seasonal deficiency. Summer is the driest season in the Cascades and Rocky Mountains west of the Continental Divide south to southwestern Colorado. The mountains east of the divide, in southwestern Colorado, and in New Mexico and Arizona, receive considerable summer rainfall, while winter snowfall can be light (23,48,64,100). Winds are predominantly from the west and southwest and can be highly destructive to Engelmann spruce (13,20).",Climate,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,2,1
"There are no recognized races or geographical varieties of Engelmann spruce. There is abundant evidence that natural introgressive hybridization between Engelmann and white spruce occurs in sympatric areas, especially around Glacier Park in Montana (32). It has been suggested that Engelmann and Sitka spruces cross in British Columbia, but it seems more likely that the crosses are between Sitka and white spruce. Engelmann spruce has been artificially crossed with several other spruces, but with only limited success (38).",Hybrids,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,9,1
"Engelmann spruce is widely distributed in the western United States and two provinces in Canada (61). Its range extends from British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, south through all western states to New Mexico and Arizona. In the Pacific Northwest, Engelmann spruce grows along the east slope of the Coast Range from west central British Columbia, south along the crest and east slope of the Cascades through Washington and Oregon to northern California (6,13,20). It is a minor component of these high-elevation forests. Engelmann spruce is a major component of the high-elevation Rocky Mountain forests, growing in the Rocky Mountains of southwestern Alberta, south through the high mountains of eastern Washington and Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana to western and central Wyoming, and in the high mountains of southern Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, eastern Nevada, New Mexico, and northern Arizona (6,13,20). - The native range of Engelmann spruce.",Native Range,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,11,1
"Available information on population differences of Engelmann spruce is limited to a few studies. For example, spruce trees from high-elevation seed sources and northern latitudes break dormancy first in the spring, and, when grown in low-elevation nurseries with low- and middle-elevation seed sources, are the first to become dormant in the fall. Conversely, low-elevation and southern latitude seed sources frequently are more resistant to spring frosts, but are less winter-hardy than middle- and high-elevation seed sources (38). In one study that compared seedlings from 20 seed sources, ranging from British Columbia to New Mexico, planted at an elevation of 9,600 feet in Colorado, seedlings from northern latitudes and lower elevations made the best height growth (93). Overall survival from all sources was 73 percent with no significant differences among sources.",Population Differences,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Engelmann spruce is monoecious; male and female strobili are formed in the axils of needles of the previous year's shoots after dormancy is broken, usually in late April to early May- Ovulate strobili (new conelets) are usually borne near ends of the shoots in the upper crown and staminate strobili on branchlets in the lower crown (38,102). Separation of male and female strobili within the crown reduces self-fertilization. The dark purple male flowers are ovoid to cylindrical and pendant. Female flowers are scarlet, erect, and cylindrical. Male flowers ripen and pollen is wind disseminated in late May and early June at low elevations, and from mid-June to early July at high elevations. The conelets grow rapidly and soon reach the size of the old cones that may have persisted from previous years. The new cones mature in one season and are 2.5 to 6.3 cm (1 to 2.5 in) long. They ripen in August to early September, open, and shed their seed. The cones may fall during the following winter or may remain attached to the tree for some time (20, 89,102). Seed Production and Dissemination- Although open-grown Engelmann spruces begin bearing cones when they are 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) tall and 15 to 40 years old, seed production does not become significant until trees are larger and older. The most abundant crops in natural stands are produced on healthy, vigorous, dominant trees 3.8 dm (15 in) or more in diameter at breast height and 150 to 250 years old. Engelmann spruce is a moderate to good seed producer (11,19,21). Good to bumper seed crops, based on the following criteria, are generally borne every 2 to 5 years, with some seed produced almost every year (19): There is great variation in seed production from year to year and from area to area. In one study on the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado, annual seed production averaged only 32,100 sound seeds per acre during the period 1956-65 (4). Only one good and two moderate crops were recorded. In more recent studies, spruce seed production has been greater, possibly because the studies were better designed to sample seed production. One such study of seed production on five National Forests, covering 42 area-seed crop years from 1962 to 1971, rated seed crops as 5 bumper, 1 heavy, 6 good, and the remaining 30 fair to failure (74). In the one year, 1967, that a bumper seed crop was produced on all areas, seed production was the highest ever recorded in Colorado (84). In another study on the Fraser Experimental Forest covering 15 years (1970-84) and 13 locations, seed production was rated 2 bumper, 3 heavy, 2 good and 8 fair to failure (21). In the northern Rocky Mountains, Boe (26) analyzed cone crops in Montana between the years 1908 and 1953. Twenty-two crops observed west of the Continental Divide during the 45-year period were rated: 5 good, 8 fair, and 9 poor. East of the Divide, seed production was poorer: only 2 good, 4 fair, and 15 poor crops were reported for a 21-year period. In other studies in the Northern and Intermountain Regions, seed production was rated as good to bumper in 1 year out of 5, with the other 4 years rated as failures (78,96). Observations in spruce forests before seedfall have indicated that part of each seed crop is lost to cone and seed insects (13). In a recently completed study in Colorado, insect-caused loss of Engelmann spruce seed averaged 28 percent of the total seed produced during a 4-year period (1974-1977) (88). The percentage of infested cones was highest during years of poor seed production. The primary seed-eating insects were a spruce seedworm (Cydia youngana = (Laspeyresia youngana) and an unidentified species of fly, possibly a Hylemya, found only in the larval stage. Some seed is lost from cutting and storing of cones by pine squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus fremonti), but the actual amount is unknown. After seed is shed, small mammals such as deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), red-backed mice (Clethrionomys gapperi), mountain voles (Microtus montanus), and chipmunks (Eutamias minimus) are the principal source of seed loss. Undoubtedly, mammals consume much seed, but the amount is not known and results of studies on protecting seed are conflicting. For example, in western Montana, spruce seedling success was little better on protected than unprotected seed spots (90), but in British Columbia, protection of spruce seed from rodents was essential to spruce regeneration success (94). Cones begin to open in September. Most seed is shed by the end of October, but some falls throughout the winter. The small, winged seeds are light, averaging about 297,000/kg (135,000/lb) (102). Nearly all of the seed is disseminated by the wind; squirrels, other mammals, and birds are not important in seed dispersal. Seed is dispersed long distances only in years of bumper seed crops. For example, studies in the Rocky Mountains show that 237,200 to 617,800 sound seeds/ha (96,000 to 250,000/acre) were dispersed 122 to 183 in (400 to 600 ft) from the source into clearcut blocks 183 m to 244 m (600 to 800 ft) wide (74). Seedfall in cut stands ranged from 1,236,000 to 12,355,000 seeds/ha (500,000 to 5,000,000/acre). In years of good to heavy seed crops, seedfall into cleared openings diminished rapidly as distance from seed source increased. Prevailing winds influence the pattern of seedfall in openings 61 to 244 m (200 to 800 ft) across, with about 40 percent of the seeds failing within 31 m (100 ft) of the windward timber edge (4,16,74). Seeffall then diminishes but at a less rapid rate of decline as distance increases to about two-thirds of the way-46 to 183 m (150 to 600 ft)-across the openings. At that distance, the average number of seeds falling is about 25 percent (at 46 m [150 ft]) to less than 5 percent (at 183 m [600 ft]) of the number of released in the uncut stand (4,74,78,80). Beyond this point, seedfall gradually increases toward the leeward timber edge, but is only about 30 percent of the seedfall along the windward edge (13,16). In the openings observed, a U-shaped pattern of seedfall was poorly defined. The ""tailing-off' suggests that significant quantities of seed were released during periods of high winds (36). Seedling Development- Viability of Engelmann spruce seed is rated good and the vitality persistent. The average germinative capacity of spruce is higher than for many associated species (102): Viable seeds of spruce that survive over winter normally germinate following snowmelt when seedbeds are moist and air temperature is at least 7° C (45° F). Field germination of spruce over long periods in Colorado have ranged from 0 to 28 percent of the sound seeds dispersed, depending upon the seedbed and environmental factors (9,73). In the undisturbed forest, spruce seeds germinate and seedlings become established on duff, litter, partially decomposed humus, decaying wood, and mounds of mineral soil upturned by windthrown trees. Any disturbance that removes the overstory produces new microhabitats (80). Under these circumstances, germination and initial establishment are generally better on prepared mineral soil, and disturbed mineral soil and humus seedbeds because moisture conditions are more stable (27,35,41,73,94). However, initial survival of spruce on severe sites at high elevations in the Intermountain Region was higher on duff seedbeds than on mineral soil seedbeds (37). Spruce seedling establishment on burned seedbeds has been variable. Success is related to severity of burn, depth of ash, and amount of exposed mineral soil (29,80,91). Regardless of the seedbed, high initial mortality usually slows establishment of seedlings. Once established (at least 5 years old), the ability to survive is not increased by a mineral soil seedbed, but is favored by adequate soil moisture, cool temperature, and shade. Engelmann spruce will germinate in all light intensities found in nature, but 40 to 60 percent of full shade is most favorable for seedling establishment at high elevations. Light intensity and solar radiation are high at elevations and latitudes where spruce grows in the central and southern Rocky Mountains, and seedlings do not establish readily in the open. Planted seedlings often develop a chlorotic appearance that has been attributed to solarization-a phenomenon by which light intensity inhibits photosynthesis and which ultimately results in death (82). Mortality can be reduced by shading seedlings. At low elevations and high latitudes in the northern Rocky Mountains, spruce can become established and survive in the open (17). Spruce can establish and survive better in low light intensities than its common, intolerant associates such as lodgepole pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and aspen, but at extremely low light intensities it cannot compete favorably with such shade-enduring associates as the true firs and hemlocks (20). Engelmann spruce is restricted to cold, humid habitats because of its low tolerance to high temperature and drought (25,45). However, solar radiation at high elevations heats soil surfaces [up to 66° C (150° F or more)] and increases water losses from both seedlings and soil by transpiration and evaporation (9,73,80). Because of its slow initial root penetration and extreme sensitivity to heat in the succulent stage, drought and heat girdling kill many first-year spruce seedlings. Drought losses can continue to be significant during the first 5 years of seedling development, especially during prolonged summer dry periods (9,34,73). Tree seedlings in the succulent stage are particularly susceptible to stem-girdling. The cortex is killed by a temperature of 54° C (130° F), but prolonged exposures to somewhat lower temperatures may also be lethal. On the Fraser Experimental Forest, heat-girdling caused much early seedling mortality on unshaded seedbeds (9,73). Soil-surface temperature exceeded 65° C (150° F) in the open on a north aspect and 71° C (160° F) on a south aspect at 3200 m (10,500 ft) elevation in June. Maximum air temperature during this period did not exceed 260 C (780 F). In western Montana, at low elevations, soil surface temperatures exceeded 71° C (160° F) on gentle north slopes several times during one summer (80). Early shade protection increased survival of newly germinated spruce seedlings; 30 to 50 percent of the seedlings were lost to heat-girdling on unshaded plots, compared to 10 percent on shaded plots. In southwestern Alberta, when newly germinated spruce seedlings were deprived of water, nearly three-fourths of the mortality on four different unshaded seedbed types was caused by heat-girdling (34). Surface temperatures as low as 45° C (113° F) caused heat girdling, but losses were not high until soil surface temperatures were above 50° C (122° F). Shading reduced heat-girdling on all seedbed types. Soil surface temperatures in excess of lethal levels for spruce seedlings, especially on burned seedbeds, have been reported in British Columbia (94). Air and soil temperatures (below the surface) are not usually directly responsible for seedling mortality, but they affect growth. In a growth chamber study of Engelmann spruce seedlings under 30 different combinations of day and night temperatures, the greatest height and root growth, and top and root dry matter production was with a diurnal variation of 19° C (66° F) (air and soil) day temperatures and 23° C (73° F) (air and soil) night temperatures (45). Shepperd (92), using the same night temperature regime, raised the day soil temperature to 23° C (72° F) and significantly increased root growth. Frost can occur any month of the growing season where spruce grows. It is most likely to occur in depressions and cleared openings because of cold air drainage and radiation cooling. Newly germinated spruce seedlings are most susceptible to early fall frosts. In a greenhouse and laboratory study, new seedlings did not survive temperatures as low as -9.5° C (15° F) until about 10 weeks old (71). Terminal bud formation began at 8 weeks; buds were set and needles were mature at 10 to 12 weeks after germination. After the first year, seedlings are most susceptible to frost early in the growing season when tissues are succulent. Shoots are killed or injured by mechanical damage resulting from tissue freezing and thawing. Frost damage has been recorded in most years in Colorado (81). In light frost years, damage was minor, but heavy frosts either damaged or killed all new shoots of open-grown seedlings. In early fall, the combination of warm daytime temperatures, nighttime temperatures below freezing, and saturated soil unprotected by snow are conducive to frost-heaving. On the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado, these conditions generally occurred about 1 out of 2 years (9,73). Frost-heaving has been one of the principal causes of first-year seedling mortality on scarified seedbeds on north aspects (9). Furthermore, seedlings continue to frost-heave after four growing seasons. Shading has reduced losses by reducing radiation cooling. The moisture condition of the seedbed during the growing season largely determines first-year seedling survival. On some sites in the central Rocky Mountains, summer drought causes great first-year mortality, especially in years when precipitation is low or irregular. On the Fraser Experimental Forest in the central Rocky Mountains, drought and desiccation caused more than half the first-year seedling mortality on south aspects, and nearly two-thirds of the total after 5 years. On north aspects during the same period, drought accounted for about 40 percent of first-year seedling mortality, and more than half the mortality at the end of 5 years (9). In the northern Rocky Mountains, late spring and early summer drought is a serious threat most years to first-year seedlings. In western Montana, all seedlings on one area were killed by drought in a 2-week period in late summer when their rate of root penetration could not keep pace with soil drying during a prolonged dry period (80). Late spring and early summer drought is also a serious cause of first-year seedling mortality in the southern Rockies. Drought losses can continue to be significant throughout the Rocky Mountains during the first 5 years of seedling development, especially during prolonged summer dry periods (9,73). The moisture provided by precipitation during the growing season is particularly critical to seedling survival during the first year. A greenhouse study of the effects of amount and distribution of moisture on seedling survival (simulating common summer precipitation patterns in north-central Colorado) showed that under favorable seedbed and environmental conditions: (1) at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch) of well distributed precipitation is needed monthly before seedlings will survive drought; (2) with this precipitation pattern, more than 3.75 cm (1.5 in) of monthly rainfall is not likely to increase seedling survival; but (3) few seedlings will survive drought with less than 5 cm (2 in) of rainfall monthly when precipitation comes in only one or two storms (18). Summer precipitation may not always benefit seedling survival and establishment. Summer storms in the Rocky Mountains may be so intense that much of the moisture runs off, especially from bare soil. Moreover, soil movement on unprotected seedbeds buries some seedlings and uncovers others (80). Understory vegetation can be either a benefit or serious constraint to spruce seedling establishment (2,35,83). Spruce seedlings become established more readily on sites protected by willows (Salix spp.), shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruiticosa), fireweed, and dwarf whortleberry than in the open. Because these plants compete less aggressively for available soil moisture than those listed below, the net effect of their shade is beneficial to seedling survival. In contrast, mortality occurs when spruce seedlings start near clumps of grass or sedges or scattered herbaceous plants such as mountain bluebells, currants (Ribes spp.), and Oregongrape that compete severely for moisture and smother seedlings with cured vegetation when compacted by snow cover (83). The only significant biotic factor affecting spruce regeneration on a long-term study on the Fraser Experimental Forest was birds. About 15 percent to 20 percent of the total mortality resulted from the clipping of cotyledons on newly germinated seedlings by grey-headed juncos (Junco caniceps) (9,73,75). Damping-off, needlecast, snowmold, insects, rodents, and trampling and browsing by large animals also kill spruce seedlings, but losses are no greater than for any other species (20). The number of seeds required to produce a first-year seedling and an established seedling (5 years old) and the number of first-year seedlings that produce an established seedling vary greatly, depending upon seed production, distance from source, seedbed, and other environmental conditions. In one study in clearcut openings in Colorado during the period 1961-1975, covering a wide variety of conditions, on the average 665 sound seeds (range 602,066) were required to produce one first-year seedling, and 6,800 (range 926-20,809) to produce a seedling 4 or more years old. An average of 21 first-year seedlings was necessary to produce a single seedling 4 or more years old, although as few as 4 and as many as 24 first-year seedlings survived under different conditions (74). Aspect and cultural treatments can also affect establishment of Engelmann spruce. In another Colorado study (covering the period 1969-1982), an average of 18 sound seeds was required to produce a single first-year seedling on shaded, mineral soil seedbeds on a north aspect; and 32 sound seeds were needed to produce a 5-year-old seedling. In contrast, 156 seeds were required to produce a first-year seedling on shaded, mineral soil seedbeds on a south aspect, and 341 seeds to produce a 5-year-old seedling (8,9). Shearer (91), studying the effects of prescribed burning and wildfire after clearcutting on regeneration in the western larch type in Montana, also found that natural and planted spruce survived better on the north aspect than on the south aspect. Environmental conditions favorable and unfavorable to the establishment of Engelmann spruce natural regeneration are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1- Environmental conditions favorable and unfavorable to Engelmann spruce regeneration (9). The early growth of Engelmann spruce at. high elevations is slow (60). First-year spruce seedlings field-grown on mineral soil seedbeds under partial shade in Colorado have a rooting depth of 7.6 to 10.2 cm (3 to 4 in), with a total root length of 12.7 cm (5 in) (72). In the Rocky Mountains of Arizona and New Mexico, root depths of vigorous 1-year-old seedlings averaged about 7.1 cm (2.8 in) on both shaded mineral soil seedbeds and on seedbeds where humus depth was about 2.5 cm (1 in) (49). Observations in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and Montana and British Columbia indicate that first-year penetration of spruce seedlings averages only about 3.8 cm (1.5 in) (80,94). Initial shoot growth of natural seedlings is equally slow in Colorado. First-year spruce seedlings are seldom taller than 2.5 cm (1 in). After 5 years, seedlings average 2.5 to 7.6 cm (1 to 3 in) in height under natural conditions, and 5.1 to 10.2 cm. (2 to 4 in) in height on both partially shaded and unshaded, prepared, mineral-soil seedbeds. Seedlings 10 years old may be only 15.2 to 20.3 cm (6 to 8 in) tall under natural conditions, and 25.7 to 30.5 cm (10 to 12 in) tall on both partially shaded and unshaded, prepared, mineral-soil seedbeds (7). After 10 years, trees grow faster, averaging about 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) in height in about 20 years in full sun or light overstory shade and in about 40 years under moderate overstory shade. Severe suppression of seedlings does occur at low light levels. It is not uncommon to find trees 80 to 120 years old only 1.0 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft) tall under the heavy shade of a closed forest canopy (76). Seedling growth has been somewhat better elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains, especially at low elevations and high latitudes. For example, in one study in the intermountain West, annual shoot growth of natural 10-year-old seedlings averaged 11.4 cm (4.5 in) on clearcut areas, and 8.3 cm (3.2 in) on areas with a partial overstory (67). Planted spruces, 5- to 8-years old, averaged 51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 in) in height in Utah. In Montana, planted spruces have been reported to reach breast height [1.4 m (4.5 ft)] in about 10 years (21). Early diameter growth of Engelmann spruce is less affected by competition for growing space than that of its more intolerant associates. In a study of seed spot density in northern Idaho, diameter growth of spruce seedlings after 17 years was only slightly greater on thinned seed spots, and height growth was unaffected by the thinning. In contrast, diameter and height growth of western white pine increased significantly as the number of seedlings per seed spot decreased (79). Vegetative Reproduction- Engelmann spruce can reproduce by layering (47). It most often layers near timberline, where the species assumes a dwarfed or prostrate form. Layering can also occur when only a few trees survive fires or other catastrophes. Once these survivors have increased to the point where their numbers alter the microenvironment enough to improve germination and establishment, layering diminishes. In general, this form of reproduction is insignificant in the establishment and maintenance of closed forest stands (21,76).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Engelmann spruce is one of the largest of the high-mountain species. Under favorable conditions, average stand diameter will vary from 38.1 to 76.2 cm (15 to 30 in), and average dominant height from 14 to 40 m (45 to 130 ft), depending upon site quality and density (20). Individual trees may exceed 101.6 cm (40 in) in diameter and 49 m (160 ft) in height (60). Engelmann spruce is a long-lived tree, maturing in about 300 years. Dominant spruces are often 250 to 450 years old, and trees 500 to 600 years old are not uncommon (13). Engelmann spruce has the capacity to grow well at advanced ages. If given sufficient growing space, it will continue to grow steadily in diameter for 300 years, long after the growth of most associated tree species slows down (20,60). Yields are usually expressed for the total stand. Engelmann spruce does not normally grow in pure stands but in various mixtures with associated species. Average volume per hectare in old-growth (normally 250 to 350 years old) spruce-fir may be practically nothing at timberline, 12,350 to 37,070 fbm/ha (5,000 to 15,000 fbm/acre) on poor sites, and 61,780 to 98,840 fbm/ha (25,000 to 40,000 fbm/acre) on better sites. Volumes as high as 197,680 to 247,100 fbm/ha (80,000 to 100,000 fbm/acre) have been reported for very old stands on exceptional sites (77,99). Average annual growth in virgin spruce-fir forests will vary from a net loss due to mortality to as much as 494 fbm/ha (200 fbm/acre), depending upon age, density, and vigor of the stand (69). Engelmann spruce usually makes up at least 70 percent and often more than 90 percent of the basal area in trees 12.7 cm (5.0 in) and larger at breast height in these stands (76). With prompt restocking after timber harvest and periodic thinning to control stand density and maintain growth rates, growth of individual spruce trees and yields of spruce-fir stands can be greatly increased and the time required to produce the above volumes and sizes reduced- For example, in stands managed at the growing stock levels (GSL) considered optimum for timber production (GSL 140 to 180) on 140- to 160-year rotations with a 20-year thinning interval, average volumes per hectare will range from 74,100 to 98,800 fbm/ha (30,000 to 40,000 fbm/acre) on poor sites to 222,400 to 259,500 fbm 1 ha (90,000 to 105,000 fbm/acre) on good sites. Volume production declines -on all sites when growing stock level is reduced below the optimum for timber production, and the decline is greater with each successive reduction in GSL. Average annual growth will vary from 445 to 1,606 fbm/ha (180 to 650 fbm/acre) (15). Moreover, since most subalpine fir will be removed in early thinnings, these yields will be largely from Engelmann spruce. Rooting Habit- Engelmann spruce has a shallow root system. The weak taproot of seedlings does not persist beyond the juvenile stage, and when trees grow where the water table is near the surface or on soils underlain by impervious rock or clay hardpans, the weak, superficial lateral root system common to the seedling stage may persist to old age. Under these conditions, most roots are in the first 30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) of soil. But, where spruce grows on deep, porous, well drained soils, the lateral root system may penetrate to a depth of 2.4 m (8 ft) or more (20). Reaction to Competition- Engelmann spruce is rated tolerant in its ability to endure shade (24). It is definitely more shade-enduring than interior Douglas-fir, western white pine, lodgepole pine, aspen, western larch, or ponderosa pine but less so than subalpine fir (the most common associate throughout much of its range), grand fir, white fir, and mountain hemlock. The Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir type is either a co-climax type or long-lived seral forest vegetation throughout much of its range. In the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta, and south of Montana and Idaho, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir occur as either codominants or in nearly pure stands of one or the other. In the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho, and in the mountains of Utah, eastern Oregon and Washington, subalpine fir is the major climax species. Engelmann spruce may also occur as a major climax species, but more often it is a persistent long-lived seral species. Pure stands of either species can be found, however (6). Although spruce-fir forests form climax or near climax vegetation associations, they differ from most climax forests in that many stands are not truly all-aged (60). Some stands are clearly single-storied, indicating that desirable spruce forests can be grown under even-aged management. Other stands are two- or three-storied, and multi-storied stands are not uncommon (13,68). These may be the result of either past disturbances, such as fire, insect epidemics, or cutting, or the gradual deterioration of old-growth stands due to normal mortality from wind, insects, and disease. The latter is especially evident in the formation of some multi-storied stands. On the other hand, some multi-storied stands appear to have originated as uneven-aged stands and are successfully perpetuating this age-class structure (16,43,104). Although climax forests are not easily displaced by other vegetation, fire, logging, and insects have played an important part in the succession and composition of spruce-fir forests. Complete removal of the stand by fire or logging results in such drastic environmental changes that spruce and fir are usually replaced by lodgepole pine, aspen, or shrub and grass communities (80,97). The kind of vegetation initially occupying the site usually determines the length of time it takes to return to a spruce-fir forest. It may vary from a few years, if the site is initially occupied by lodgepole pine or aspen, to as many as 300 years, if grass is the replacement community. What is known about the utilization of water by Engelmann spruce in Colorado can be summarized as follows: (1) leaf water potential decreases in proportion to the transpiration rate but is influenced by soil temperature and water supply; (2) needle water vapor conductance (directly proportional to stomatal opening) is controlled primarily by visible irradiance and absolute humidity difference from needle to air (evaporative demand), with secondary effects from temperature and water stress; (3) nighttime minimum temperatures below 3.9° C (39° F) retard stomatal opening the next day, but stomata function well from early spring to late fall, and high transpiration rates occur even with snowpack on the ground; (4) leaf water vapor conductance is higher in Engelmann spruce than in subalpine fir, but lower than in lodgepole pine and aspen; (5) Engelmann spruce trees have less total needle area per unit area of sapwood water conducting tissue than subalpine fir but more than lodgepole pine and aspen; and (6) Engelmann spruce trees have a greater needle area per unit of bole or stand basal area than subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, and aspen. At equal basal area, annual canopy transpiration of spruce is about 80 percent greater than lodgepole pine, 50 percent greater than subalpine fir, and 220 percent greater than aspen. These high rates of transpiration cause Engelmann spruce to occur primarily on moist sites (50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58). Both even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems are appropriate for use in Engelmann spruce forests, but not all cutting methods meet specific management objectives (5,12,17). The even-aged cutting methods include clearcutting, which removes all trees in strips, patches, blocks, or stands with a single cut; and shelterwood cutting, which removes trees in one, two, or three cuts and its modifications. Because of susceptibility to windthrow, the seed-tree method is not a suitable way to regenerate spruce. The seedbed is prepared for regeneration after clearcutting, or after the seed cut with shelterwood cutting, by various methods ranging from burning and mechanical scarification to only that associated with logging activity (5,12,17). The uneven-aged cutting methods appropriate to spruce are individual tree and group selection cuttings and their modifications, which remove selected trees in all size classes at periodic intervals over the entire area or in groups up to 0.8 hectares (2 acres) in size. Reproduction occurs continuously, but methods of site preparation are limited (12,13). Shelterwood and individual tree selection cutting methods will favor associated species such as true firs and hemlocks over spruce. Clearcutting, group shelterwood, and group selection cutting methods will favor Engelmann spruce over these more tolerant associates, but will increase the proportion of intolerant associates such as lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir (13). Damaging Agents- Engelmann spruce is susceptible to windthrow, especially after any initial cutting in old-growth forests. Partial cutting increases the risk because the entire stand is opened up and therefore vulnerable. Windfall is usually less around clearcuts because only the boundaries between cut and leave areas are vulnerable, but losses can be great if no special effort is made to locate windfirm cutting-unit boundaries (1,3). While the tendency of spruce to windthrow is usually attributed to a shallow root system, the development of the root system varies with soil and stand conditions. Trees that have developed together in dense stands over long periods of time mutually protect each other and do not have the roots, boles, or crowns to withstand sudden exposure to wind if opened up too drastically. If the roots and boles are defective, the risk of windthrow is increased. Furthermore, regardless of kind or intensity of cutting, or soil and stand conditions, windthrow is greater on some exposures than others. Alexander (13) has identified spruce windfall risk in relation to exposures in Colorado as follows: Below Average: Above Average: Very High: The risk of windfall in these situations is increased at least one category by such factors as poor drainage, shallow soils, defective roots and boles, and overly dense stands. Conversely, the risk of windfall is reduced if the stand is open-grown or composed of young, vigorous, sound trees. All situations become very high risk if exposed to special topographic situations, such as gaps or saddles in ridges at high elevations to the windward that can funnel winds into the area (1,3,13). The spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) is the most serious insect pest of Engelmann spruce (86). It is restricted largely to, mature and overmature spruce, and epidemics have occurred throughout recorded history. One of the most damaging out breaks was in Colorado from 1939 to 1951, when beetles killed nearly 6 billion board feet of standing spruce (64). Damaging attacks have been largely associated with extensive windthrow, where downed trees have provided an ample food supply for a rapid buildup of beetle populations. Cull material left after logging has also caused outbreaks, and there are examples of large spruce beetle populations developing in scattered trees windthrown after heavy partial cutting. The beetle progeny then emerge to attack living trees, sometimes seriously damaging the residual stand. Occasionally, serious spruce beetle outbreaks have developed in overmature stands with no recent history of cutting or windfall, but losses in uncut stands that have not been subjected to catastrophic wind storms have usually been no greater than normal mortality in old growth (13). Spruce beetles prefer downed material to standing trees, but if downed material is not available, then standing trees may be attacked. Large, overmature trees are attacked first, but if an infestation persists, beetles will attack and kill smaller trees after the large trees in the stand are killed. In the central Rocky Mountains susceptibility to beetle attack can vary by location; the following sites are arranged from most to least susceptible: (1) trees in creek bottoms, (2) good stands on benches and high ridges, (3) poor stands on benches and high ridges, (4) mixed stands, and (5) immature stands (59,85). Analysis of past infestations suggests the following kinds of stands are susceptible to outbreaks: (1) single- or two-storied stands, (2) high proportions of spruce in the overstory, (3) basal area of 34 m²/ha (150 ft²/acre) or more in older and larger trees, and (4) an average 10-year periodic diameter growth of 1.0 cm (0.4 in) or less (87). The western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) is another potentially dangerous insect attacking Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir (40). Although spruce and fir are among the preferred hosts, budworm. populations have been held in check by combinations of several natural control factors- parasites, predators, diseases, and adverse climatic conditions. The potential for future outbreaks is always present, however. An excellent summary of the ecology, past insecticidal -treatments, and silvicultural practices associated with western spruce budworm in northern Rocky Mountain forests is given by Carlson et al. (28). The most common diseases of Engelmann spruce are caused by wood-rotting fungi that result in loss of volume and predispose trees to windthrow and windbreak (46). In a recent study of cull indicators and associated decay in Colorado, the major root and butt fungi in mature to overmature Engelmann spruce were identified as Phellinus nigrolimitatus, Flammula alnicola, Polyporus tomentosus var. curnatua, Gloeocystidiellum radiosum, and Coniophora puteana. Trunk rots, which caused 88 percent of the decay, were associated with Phellinus pini, Haematosterceum sanguinolentum, Echinodontium sulcatum, and Amylosterceum chailletii. Spruce broom rust (Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli) is also common in spruce-fir forests. It causes bole deformation, loss of volume, and spiketops; increases susceptibility to windbreak; and provides infection courts for decay fungi in spruce (20,46). Dwarfmistletoe (Arceuthobium microcarpum) causes heavy mortality in spruce in Arizona and New Mexico, but it has a limited range in the Southwest and is not found elsewhere (44). Engelmann spruce does not prune well naturally. Thin bark and the persistence of dead lower limbs make it susceptible to destruction or severe injury by fire (fig. 8). Many root and trunk rots in old growth appear to be associated with fire injury. Because of the climate where spruce grows, the risk of fire is less than in warmer and drier climates (20).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,14,1
"Information on soils where Engelmann spruce grows is limited. In the Pacific Coast region, soil parent materials are mixed and varied. Country bedrock is composed of a variety of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock. The most common of the great soil groups are Cryorthods (Podzolic soils), Haplumbrepts (western Brown forest soils), Haplorthods (Brown Podzolic soils), Hapludalfs (Gray-Brown Podzolic soils), and Haploxerults and Haplohumults (Reddish-Brown Lateritic soils); these great soil groups developed from deep glacial and lacustrine deposits, deep residual material weathered in place from country rock, and volcanic lava and ash. Xerochrepts (Regosolic soils), developed from shallow residual material, are also widespread. Xeropsamments (Regosolic soils) and Haplaquolls (Humic Gley soils) are the principal soils derived from alluvium. On the east side of the Cascade crest, soils are largely Haploxeralfs (Non-Calcic Brown soils) and Haploxerolls (Chestnut soils) (39,103). In the Rocky Mountain subalpine zone, soil materials vary according to the character of the bedrock from which they originated. Crystalline granite rock predominates, but conglomerates, shales, sandstones, basalts, and andesites commonly occur. Glacial deposits and stream alluvial fans are also common along valley bottoms. Of the great soils group, Cryorthods (Podzolic Soils) and Haplorthods (Brown Podzolic Soils) occur extensively on all aspects. Cryochrepts (Thick Cold Soils) occur extensively on the drier aspects. Aquods (Ground-water Podzolic Soils) are found in the poorly drained areas. Cryoboralfs (Gray-Wooded Soils) are found where timber stands are -less dense and parent material finer textured. Haploborolls (Brown Forest Soils) occur mostly in the lower subalpine zone along stream terraces and side slopes. Lithics (Lithosolic Soils) occur wherever bedrock is near the surface. Aquepts (Bog Soils) and Haplaquepts (Humic Gley Soils) occur extensively in poorly drained upper stream valleys (48,103). Regardless of the parent materials, spruce grows best on moderately deep, well drained, loamy sands and silts, and silt and clay loam soils developed from a variety of volcanic and sedimentary rock. Good growth also is made on glacial and alluvial soils developed from a wide range of parent materials, where an accessible water table is more important than physical properties of the soil. It does not grow well on rocky glacial till, heavy clay surface soils, saturated soils, or on shallow, dry coarse-textured sands and gravels developed primarily from granitic and schistic rock or course sandstones and conglomerates (13,23). Along the east slope of the Coast Range and interior valleys of southwestern British Columbia, Engelmann spruce grows at 762 to 1067 m (2,500 to 3,500 ft). Farther south in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, it generally grows at 1219 to 1829 m (4,000 to 6,000 ft), but it may be found at 2438 m (8,000 ft) on sheltered slopes and at 610 m (2,000 ft) in cold pockets along streams and valley bottoms. In northern California, spruce grows at 1219 to 1524 m (4,000 to 5,000 ft) (16,98). South of the Peace River Plateau in the Canadian Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta, Engelmann spruce grows at 762 to 1829 m (2,500 to 6,000 ft); in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and Montana and in the adjacent mountains of eastern Washington and Oregon, at 610 to 2743 m (2,000 to 9,000 ft). But above 1829 to 2286 m (6,000 to 7,500 ft), it is a minor component of the stand, and below 1524 m (5,000 ft) it is confined to moist, low slopes and cold valley bottoms (20). Engelmann spruce is found at 2743 to 3353 m (9,000 to 11,000 ft) in the Rocky Mountains of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, but it may extend as low as 2438 m (8,000 ft) along cold stream bottoms and to timberline at 3505 m (11,500 ft). In the Rocky Mountains of New Mexico and Arizona and on the plateaus of southern Utah, it grows at 2896 to 3353 m (9,500 to 11,000 ft), but it may grow as low as 2438 m (8,000 ft) and as high as 3658 m (12,000 ft) (13,20).",Soils and Topography,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,15,1
"Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forests occupy the greatest water yielding areas in the Rocky Mountains. They also provide timber, habitats for a wide variety of game and nongame wildlife, forage for livestock, and recreational opportunities and scenic beauty (5). However, these properties are indigenous to where spruce grows rather than to any special properties associated with the species. The lumber of spruce is likely to contain many small knots. Consequently, it yields only small amounts of select grades of lumber, but a high proportion of the common grades (70). In the past, spruce was used principally for mine timbers, railroad ties, and poles. Today, much of the lumber is used in home construction where great strength is not required, and for prefabricated wood products. In recent years, rotary-cut spruce veneer has been used in plywood manufacture. Other uses of spruce include specialty items such as violins, pianos and aircraft parts (22,63). The pulping properties of Engelmann spruce are excellent. Long fibers, light color, and absence of resins permit trees to be pulped readily by the sulfite, sulfate, or groundwood processes (22,101). The species has been used for pulp in the northern Rocky Mountains but not in the central or southern Rocky Mountains.",Special Uses,Engelmann spruce,picea,engelmannii,conifer,16,1
"Natural alder communities include ash, birch, willow, and oak, ""forming ash-alder wood on low-lying ground of high soil fertility and moisture, alder-willow thickets in areas liable to seasonal flooding, and alder-birch wood on higher lying, less fertile, generally acid soils.... Pure stands are ... common, but not as extensive in Britain as, for example, in northwest Germany"" (60). European alder and gray willow, Salix cinerea atrocinerea, form a tidal woodland near the upper limits of a salt marsh on the Cornish coast. In the absence of disturbance, the alder-willow community succeeds the marsh (78).",Associated Forest Cover,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,1,0
"The duration of low winter temperature limits the range of European alder in Scandinavia because the species does not extend into regions where the mean daily temperature is above freezing for less than 6 months of the year. The southeastern boundary of European alder distribution in Eurasia corresponds closely with the 500 mm (20 in) annual rainfall line (60). European alder is hardy to winter temperatures of -54° C (-65° F) (36), but apparent winter damage to young European alder plantings in North Carolina resulted in partial to complete dieback of 80 percent of the trees. Relatively early low temperatures in November and December were probably responsible for the damage, rather than extreme cold, as the overwinter minimum was only -18° C (0° F) (9).",Climate,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,2,0
"European alder has a broad natural range that includes most of Europe and extends into North Africa, Asia Minor, and western Siberia (82). Densest distribution is in the lowlands of northern Germany, northern Poland, White Russia, and the northwestern Ukraine (33). The species is locally naturalized throughout the northeastern United States and maritime Canada.",Habitat,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,8,0
"Over the broad range of European alder, racial development is to be expected, but within regions, variation is sometimes slight. Fifteen European alder provenance collections, grown on calcareous spoil banks in southern Ohio for 16 years, differed sharply in both growth and survival. Most of the trees originated in central and north-central Europe; survival was best for three seedlots of central German provenance. Trees from Diessen, Bavaria, grew to be 21 percent taller and 20 percent larger in diameter than the plantation mean and averaged 0.57 rn (1.87 ft) per year in height growth over the past 10 years. Alders of Uppland, Sweden, provenance were almost complete failures, being only 3.5 m (11.5 ft) tall with 11 percent survival after 16 years (29). The 16-year results reported above are reasonably consistent with those at age 6, with one striking exception. Trees from Peiting, Bavaria, formerly second tallest in the plantation (28), have virtually collapsed, with survival declining to 37 percent, and height growth over the past 10 years least of all except for the trees from Uppland, Sweden (29). Similar results are reported from European alder trials in the Netherlands, where trees from three German seed sources grew rapidly for 7 years and then slowly for the following 3 years (96). The need for caution in making early selections is obvious. In a larger but younger provenance trial in Pennsylvania, most trees burst buds with a 4-day period well before the beginning of the frost-free season. Most of the fastest growing trees originated from the central part of the species'natural distribution. About half the variation in total height was due to rate of growth; the other half was due to length of the growing season (23). European alders that grow fastest are more likely to be single-stemmed. At age 6 in the Ohio test, the correlation between height and number of stems per tree was -0.31 (28). European alder hybridizes readily with many other alders. Particularly vigorous hybrids have been reported for A. cordata x A. glutinosa (48), A. glutinosa x A. incana (47), A. glutinosa x A. rubra (53), and A. glutinosa x A. orientalis (95).",Hybrids,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,9,0
"In an extensive progeny test of select European alder parent trees, heritability of height growth was good at age 7. Most good clones performed consistently when used as either male or female parents. The general superiority of alders from the moraine region of upper Bavaria was confirmed (102).",Population Differences,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- European alder is monoecious; flowers of both sexes emerge from buds that begin to develop about 9 to 10 months before pollination. These preformed buds allow an early estimate of the following year's seed crop. Male buds are distinctly longer than female buds-about 1 cm (0.4 in) compared to about 3 mm (0.1 in)-and grow nearer the tips of branchlets. They remain green until December and grow intermittently throughout the winter (74). Female flowers are 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long when mature; male catkins are from 5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 in) long. They vary in color from tree to tree, over a range from light peach to deep purple. Occasional bisexual catkins are found. A general calendar of seed formation is as follows (61,74): Styles begin to form in July, year 1; rest period follows from August, year 1 to February, year 2; pollination occurs in February to March, year 2; placenta forms in May, year 2; ovules form in June, year 2; ovary begins to grow from June to July, year 2; embryo sacs are formed in July, year 2; fertilization takes place from late July to early August, year 2; embryo grows throughout August, year 2; embryo ripens throughout September and germination first becomes possible during this month. Seeds are mature when their pericarps turn brown, although the cones remain green until the seeds are released. As an exception to this calendar, pollination is sometimes delayed until early April in the northeastern United States. The flowering schedule is typically dichogamous. Most European alder trees are virtually self-sterile (61), but certain selfed trees have produced seed with germination percentages as high as 8 percent (81). Viability of cross-pollinated seed ranged from 8 to 90 percent (61,81). Viability of pollen was greater than 99 percent at the time of collection (61) but fell to about 1 percent after 50 days storage (73). Individual trees in Iowa set a good crop of seed every year, but the percentage of filled, viable seed ranged from 0 to 90 percent. Because fertilization occurs in July and August, the developing embryo may be especially vulnerable to heat and moisture stress. Seed with little or no viability was produced in years of severe summer drought (37). Seed Production and Dissemination- In Europe, alder may not produce a uniform seed crop every year (61) but abundant crops are frequent (56). Plantations in the eastern United States seem to bear out both points: seed crops do vary from year to year and they are generally rather heavy. European alder (fig. 1) is precocious; some trees begin to flower at the beginning of their second growing season and by their sixth or seventh year are producing large quantities of seeds. Several hundred strobiles may develop on a 6- to 9-m (20- to 30-ft) tree, and in summer and early autumn the mass of maturing fruit approximates the mass of foliage (74). Seeds average 60 per catkin (60). The seeds are very small brown nuts, ranging from about 240,000/kg (110,000/lb) (56) to as many as 1,400,000/kg (639,000/lb) (87). Seeds begin to fall in late September or early October and the best seeds usually fall first (11,92). Seed dispersal continues throughout the winter. Very few alder seeds remain viable beyond the first germination season (62). Seed production as high as 18 kg/ha (16 lb/acre) has been achieved in a 14-year-old grafted orchard in southwestern Germany; yields of 5 to 13 kg/ha (4.5 to 12 lb/acre) were more typical (54). Although European alder seeds can germinate immediately after they are shed, stratification and cold treatment enhance their germination capacity (85). Seeds collected before strobiles turn brown require several months of afterripening to germinate (60). Epigeal germination in the nursery is prompt; it begins 10 to 20 days after spring sowing and is essentially complete within 2 weeks. Germination is notably better at pH 4 than at higher or lower pH (85). Production of containerized alder seedlings allows them to be inoculated with Frankia and assures their nodulation prior to planting. A I to 1 ratio of peat and vermiculite in the potting mix is recommended (7). European alder seeds have no wings; therefore, despite their small size they are usually not spread more than 30 to 60 in (100 to 200 ft) by the wind, although they may occasionally be blown much farther over the top of crusted snow. Where wind is the only likely means of dissemination, alder saplings are rarely found more than 20 to 30 in (65 to 100 ft) from the parent tree. The seeds contain an air bladder and float in water, and McVean holds that rather than wind, running water and wind drift over standing water are the principal agents of dispersal (62). Naturalized European alder stands in the United States are most commonly found adjacent to streams. Seedling Development- Seeds buried more than 0.5 cin (0.2 in) deep germin4e satisfactorily but many of the new seedlings fail to emerge (62). The soil need not be saturated to gain good seed germination, but high air humidity is essential. In regions with only 50 to 65 cm (20 to 25 in) of annual rainfall, ""alder seedlings will only establish where the surface soil falls within the capillary fringe of the water table so that it remains constantly moist for 20 to 30 days in the spring (March to May)"" (63). Alder seedlings can survive, although not thrive, under conditions of flooding that would kill off the seedlings of most other forest trees. In a British experiment, seedlings did not live indefinitely with their entire root systems completely submerged and were quickly killed by such treatment during the growing season. Nevertheless, when the water level was maintained flush with the top of the soil, the more robust seedlings were able to produce adventitious roots at the soil surface and their growth was hindered very little (63). The original roots of European alder can grow actively during periods of flooding lasting for as long as 1 week and resume growth after longer periods of flooding (31). In another greenhouse study, alder seedlings were successfully grown in oxygen-free soil, outperforming white willow (Salix alba) under such conditions (10). Growth of young potted European alder seedlings was not inhibited by addition of foliage litter of six herbaceous species that did inhibit growth of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Alder seedling growth and root nodulation were more than doubled by addition of crownvetch (Coronilla varia) litter (49). A light intensity equivalent to about 5 percent of full daylight is essential for first-year alder establishment; for survival in subsequent years about 20 percent of full daylight is required (63). ""First-year seedlings and 2- to 3-year-old plants up to 5 cin (2 in) in height are frequent in some woods, but complete internal regeneration is seldom seen. Regeneration tends to be peripheral, or to occur with the formation of an even-aged stand"" (60). Natural alder seedlings in Croatia grow to be about 0.5 in (1.7 ft) tall in their first year (32), but seedlings in American nurseries are not always as large. Alder seedlings are associated with actinomycetes and mycorrhizae. Development of nitrogen-fixing root nodules in European alder is induced through root-hair infection by actinomycetes of the genus Frankia. Actinomycetous endophytes isolated from European alder are cross-infective with other Alnus species and even other genera such as sweetfern (Comptonia) and bayberry (Myrica) (38). Thus, even though European alder is not native to the United States, suitably infective actinomycetes may be available wherever it is planted (20). On the other hand, in a greenhouse study, European alders inoculated with native European endophytes grew six times faster than those inoculated with a Comptonia isolate (59). Strongly infective Frankia strains are not necessarily effective in stimulating rapid alder growth, and those that produce spores may be weak ly parasitic, rather than symbiotic (58). European alder has been found associated with at least six mycorrhizal fungi. Suitable symbionts appear to be widely available, as both ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae were found on root samples taken from European alder plantations in Iowa, on coal strip mines in Ohio, and on kaolin spoils is Georgia (38). Ecto-, endo- and ectendomycorrhizae were described as associated with European alder of Bohemian lignite spoil banks. The endomycorrhizae were found only below 10 cm (4 in) depth (66). Vegetative Reproduction- European alder commonly sprouts from the stump after cutting, and live branches can be layered successfully. Root suckers are rare (60). In coastal southern Sweden, alders live to maximum age of 100 years but frequently produce basal sprouts and form multi-stemmed stumps following death of the original stem (18). Air-layering of alder shoots has been 89 to 100 percent successful (84). The rooting ability of greenwood cuttings of European alder seedlings less than 4 years old was found to be generally high; over an 18- to 20-month period, 100 to 200 cuttings were successfully rooted from each ortet (25). Alnus glutinosa can be readily propagated by in vitro tissue culture. Plantlets of several clones were rooted within 3 weeks, subsequently transferred to soil mix, and maintained in good physiological state for as long as 4 years (90).",Reproduction and Early Growth,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Height growth begins in midApril and continues through July or August. Saplings may continue growing into September or October (59,101). In the mountains of Czechoslovakia, 90 percent of diameter growth takes place between midMay and mid-August, a growing season almost identical to that of European beech (Fagus syluatica) (12). In Switzerland, alder root growth commenced about 4 days after the beginning of vegetative bud swelling and about 5 weeks before the beginning of branch extension growth (51). Root growth resumes in October and continues throughout the winter except when the ground is frozen (79). Height growth of alder seedlings planted on rather acid (pH 4.3 to 4.5) strip-mined lAnd in Ohio falls between normal yield values (table 1) for site classes I and 11 at age 16 (29). On a moderately permeable bottom-land site in southern Illinois, 9-year-old European alder outgrew predicted height values and averaged 11.2 m (36.8 ft) tall, and 13.7 cm (5.4 in) in d.b.h. (72). Height growth slowed markedly (80) over the next 5 years in this widely spaced plantation, and at age 14 the trees averaged 12.3 m (40.4 ft) tall and 20.1 cm (7.9 in) in d.b.h. (table 2). European alder usually reaches two-thirds of its maximum height by age 25 (33) but may survive for 120 years on the best sites, growing to be at least I in (3 ft) in diameter (60). The root wood of European alder has lower specific gravity than the stem wood but longer fibers with thinner walls (100). In an Ohio stripmine plantation, stem wood specific gravity averaged 0.39 and did not vary with age or geographic origin of the trees. Fiber length increased from 0.71 min (0.28 in) at age 5 to 0.93 min (0.36 in) at age 17 (83). Representative percent chemical composition of European alder from two points of view has been reported. The first was based on total aboveground biomass, 4-year-old trees (104); the second was based on leaf litter from four stands (69): Rooting Habit- Alder has been characterized as possessing an extensive root system of both surface and deep branches, which enables it to survive on either waterlogged soils or those with a deep water table (60). In Germany, European alder is considered to be the deepest rooting indigenous tree species (86). Alder's deeply penetrating taproots often extend well below normal water table; if the water level falls, these roots are well situated to use deep-lying soil moisture not available to the upper portion of the root system. This may explain alder's outstanding success on spoil banks (37,64). Generally, there are two kinds of alder root nodules. One is a large, perennial, usually single nodule sometimes 5 cm (2 in) or more in diameter (21) and most often situated near the root crown. These nodules may persist as long as 10 years, with those in the 4- to 5-year age class making up the greatest proportion of the weight of nodules per tree (1). The other type is ephemeral, much smallertypically 1.5 to 3 mm (0.06 to 0.12 in) in diameterand generally distributed throughout the surface root system. Becking found that molybdenum-deficient alder plants formed many small nodules of much reduced total dry weight and exhibited associated nitrogen deficiency. Plants with an adequate molybdenum supply had mainly single large nodules (6). The most striking effect of alders on soil is nitrogen enrichment. Not only is alder leaf litter rich in nitrogen (68), but many nitrogenous compounds are heavily concentrated in alder roots and root nodules (99). In European alder seedlings, rate of nitrogen fixation is closely related to nodule fresh weight and total plant dry weight, suggesting that selection for growth should also achieve gains in nitrogen fixation (4). In Quebec, 3- and 4-year-old alders planted at 33 cin by 33 cm (13 in by 13 in) spacing fixed nitrogen at an annual rate of 53 kg/ha (47 lb/acre) (15). Fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by alders takes place in root vesicles (67) and nodules (8). In a greenhouse experiment, maximum nitrogen fixation in young European alder plants occurred in late August; throughout the growing season about 90 percent of the nitrogen fixed was steadily transferred from the nodules to the rest of the plant (91). In an alder grove growing on peat in the Netherlands, nitrogen fixation was also found to peak in August (1). European alder (as well as other Alnus species) differs from most deciduous tree species in retaining much foliar nitrogen in the leaves until they fall (17). In a southern Illinois plantation, nitrogen content of leaves decreased by only one-sixth from midsummer until leaf fall. At the time of the last collection, in mid-November, leaf nitrogen content was about 2.6 percent; thus there was a substantial quantity of nitrogen to be dropped in the leaf litter (21). In Finland, a 13-year-old European alder plantation and a 55-year-old natural stand were sampled for 4 years. Alder litter averaged 2690 and 3705 kg/ha (2,400 and 3,305 lb/acre) per year (ovendried), respectively, and contributed about 82 percent of the total annual litter production. Total nitrogen content of the leaf litter averaged 77 kg/ha (69 lb/acre) per year, reaching a high of 101 kg/ha (90 lb/acre) in 1 year in the plantation. NH4-nitrogen in the upper 3-cm layer of soil rose from 180 mg/kg (180 p/m) before leaf fall to 270 mg/kg (270 p/m) after leaf fall, indicating that at least part of the nitrogen of alder leaf litter was rapidly mineralized (69). Prodigious amounts of litter can accumulate under alder stands. For instance, 10 species of pines and deciduous trees were planted on a Kentucky strip mine with and without alternate rows of European alder. After 10 years, 28.7 t/ha (12.8 tons/acre) of litter accumulated in the plantings without alder, while 61.7 t/ha (27.5 tons/acre) built up under the stands with a 50 percent alder component. The relative contribution of alder leaf fall and increased litter production of the other species, stimulated by the alder, could not be determined. In the spring of the 10th growing season, the pH of the spoil beneath the stand containing alder was significantly lower than the plantings without alder. Similarly, the concentration of total soluble salts was consistently higher, both spring and fall, in the stands with alder than in those without (75). European alder leaf litter readily gives up watersoluble organic substances, losing 12 percent of its dry weight after only 1 day's leaching in cold water. Alder litter was also found to decompose faster than that of beech or oak (70). The C:N ratio of alder foliage suspended in a stream declined rapidly from 19 to about 13 within a month after leaf fall, then more slowly to 11 (near the effective mineralization optimum) after 6 months (13). Other components of alders also accumulate considerable nitrogen. In a plantation on a good alluvial site in western Kentucky the following nitrogen contents (percent dry weight) were measured at the end of the fourth growing season (adapted from 104): Even young alders can fix and add significant amounts of nitrogen to soil. A Padus silt loam in Wisconsin averaged 966 mg/kg (966 p/m) of nitrogen in the upper 4 cm (1.5 in) of dry soil before 1-year-old European alder seedlings were planted. After two growing seasons, soil nitrogen (at the same depth) had increased 222 mg/kg (222 p/m) in soil immediately adjacent to the alders and by 158 mg/kg (158 p/m) at a distance of 15 cin (6 in) (39). Reaction to Competition- The alder is primarily a pioneer and opportunist species, and is capable of direct colonization of even the rawest of soil material.... The species acts as a pioneer on hydroseres, being capable of colonizing at very early stages in the primary succession if good seed is available. Alder carr (deciduous woodland or scrub on a permanently wet, organic soil) does not succeed an earlier Salix and Rharnnus carr, though these species may colonize simultaneously, and pure alder carr eventually results from the greater vigour and longevity of the alders"" (65). In central Switzerland, alder is considered to be more shade tolerant than willow (Salix spp.), larch (Larix spp.), poplar (Populus spp.), birch (Betula spp.), or Scotch pine (Pinus syluestris); equal in tolerance to ash Traxinus spp.); apd less tolerant than eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) or Douglasfir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (50). Overall, it is classed as intolerant of shade (18). In Yugoslavia and Germany, European alder is grown on 40- to 80-year rotations, depending on intensity of thinning and products desired. The stand is clearcut at the end of the rotation and replanted with 1-year seedlings or 1-1 transplants. Nursery practice for European alder is fairly routine, and 1-year seedlings are usually large enough for outplanting. Liberal irrigation following sowing is essential for good seed germination. Alder has generally beneficial effects on associated plants. Part of the nitrogen fixed by alders soon becomes available to other species in mixed stands, especially through mineralization of nitrogen leached from litter. Norway spruce (Picea abies) grown in pots with European alder ""obtained nitrogen fixed in the root nodules of alder although leaves falling in autumn were always carefully removed"" (98). In a 3-year-old Wisconsin plantation, hybrid poplars in a plantation spaced at 1.2 by 1.2 in (3.9 by 3.9 ft) grew 21 percent taller in a 1:2 mixture with European alder than when grown without alder (4.9 m versus 4.0 m; 16.0 ft versus 13.1 ft). This growth increase corresponded closely with that achieved through optimal ammonium nitrate fertilizer treatment, which stimulated a 24 percent increase (39). Similar results were obtained in Quebec where mixed plantings of two alders per poplar yielded slightly more total biomass at age 3 than pure alder plantings and 50 percent more than pure hybrid poplar (16). European alder often is recommended for use in mixed plantings with other species on nitrogen-poor sites. On strip-mined sites in eastern Kentucky, 10 coniferous and broadleaved species were grown in alternate rows with European alder at 2.1 by 2.1 m (6 : 9 by 6.9 ft) spacing; after 10 years, trees grown in mixture with alder were 11 to 84 percent taller and 20 to 200 percent larger in diameter than the same species grown without alder (75). In northern Bohemia, Populus x berolinensis used for strip-mine reclamation averaged 12.5 m (41 ft) tall at age 14 in pure plantings but grew to 14 m (46 ft) in mixture with Alnus glutinosa; poplars in the mixed planting were also much straighter (24). In southern Indiana, European alder seedlings were interplanted into a 2-year-old plantation of black walnut (Juglans nigra) on well-drained silt loam soil. Ten years after interplanting, walnuts grown in mixture with alder averaged 5.3 in (17.5 ft) tall against 4.2 in (13.8 ft) in pure stands; alder stimulated an increase in walnut diameter from 5.6 cm (2.2 in) to 6.9 cm (2.7 in) (14). In contrast, at four locations in Illinois and Missouri, alder interplanted with walnut suddenly declined and died after 8-13 years. Allelopathy caused by juglone was the only cause of death that could be substantiated (80). Damaging Agents- In a Scottish plantation survey, European alder suffered less damage by deer browsing and rubbing than did birch, willow, or other hardwood species (2). In contrast, deer browsed more than half the European alder seedlings in a 2-yearold plantation in Pennsylvania; damage was much less on Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis), white spruce (Picea glauca), eastern white pine, and red pine (Pinus resinosa) (26). Dozens of insects and diseases have been observed on European alder but few cause serious damage. Among pests recognized as potentially troublesome is the striped alder sawfly, Hernichroa crocea, a native of Europe that is now found across northern United States and Canada. It produces two generations per year. From July through September larvae occasionally eat all of the alder leaves except the midrib and larger veins (93). The European alder leafminer, Fenusa dohrnii, is another introduced species. It makes blotch mines on alder leaves in the northern United States and southeastern Canada (5). The alder flea beetle, Altica ambiens alni, feeds on both surfaces of alder leaves from Maine to New Mexico. It is sometimes a pest of alders in recreational areas and along roadsides (93). The woolly alder aphid, Prociphilus tesselatus, is distributed throughout the eastern United States and is often abundant on alder. Although it causes little direct damage, it is suspected of weakening the trees and providing infection courts for subsequent fungal attack. Several fungus species have been isolated from Alnus glutinosa trees that died back following woolly aphid infestations. They include Botryodiplodia theobromae (76) which has not been confirmed as pathogenic. In an A. glutinosa seed production plantation in Kentucky, Phornopsis alnea caused basal stem cankers and eventual mortality as great as 17 percent (71). In northern Mississippi, occasional alder trees infested with woolly aphids are heavily damaged by sapsuckers (103). Alder seems to be very resistant to chronic ozone fumigation (45); in contrast, it is more susceptible to S02 damage than most species (94).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,14,0
"European alder grows well on acid soils, and its growth is reduced under the alkaline or near-neutral conditions that are desirable for many other species. The author is Assistant Director, Northeastern Forest Experiment Station, Radnor, PA. During their first growing season in most types of soils alder seedlings form root nodules that are the site of nitrogen fixation. Seedlings already nodulated grow satisfactorily when outplanted on sites with pH as low as 3.3; plants not already nodulated usually die under these very acid conditions (27,77). Nodules develop satisfactorily at pH as low as 4.2 (8), but seedlings were stunted and had poor root systems and chlorotic leaves when grown in clay soil with pH between 8.0 and 8.5 (63). Optimum soil pH for nodulation appears to be between 5.5 and 7.0 (35). Spoil-bank plantations in Ohio and Kentucky verify the minimum pH for satisfactory European alder growth as about 3.4 (30,55). On very acid (pH 2.9) coal spoils in Indiana, alder survival, growth, and root nodule weight were all increased by liming sufficient to raise pH to at least 6.1 (eventually declining to 4.8) (41). In a greenhouse experiment using acidic Pennsylvania mine spoil, alders did not respond to lime amendments until phosphorus was also added (89). Both nodulated and nonnodulated alders require molybdenum for nitrogen metabolism (6,42); adequate amounts of Mo are present in most soils, although it may not be available on strongly acid sites. On sites with poor internal drainage, European alder can tolerate iron concentrations normally toxic to many plants (44). On tidal flats adjacent to the English Channel, the chlorine concentration of the soil solution in the root zone of mature alders occasionally rises to 5 percent of that of sea water immediately following equinoctial high tides (78). European alder is responsive to differences in soil moisture (5,40), and growth often is notably better on lower slopes than on upper slopes. Alder utilizes intermittently moist sites very well (56). It is ""a species of stream and lake sides and ... soils of impeded drainage throughout the British Isles,"" although not topographically limited to such sites if rainfall is high (60). Even though alder tolerates heavy soils better than most trees, reduced soil oxygen (especially below 5 percent) inhibits root nodulation and the growth of nodulated plants (57). In a species with such a broad natural range, altitudinal distribution is bound to be related to latitude. European alder is found at sea level at the northern limits of its range, up to 300 in (985 ft) in Norway, 600 in (1,970 ft) in the Harz Mountains of Saxony, 850 in (2,790 ft) in the Bavarian Mountains, 1300 in (4,270 ft) in the Tyrol and in Greece, and 1800 in (5,900 ft) in the Caucasus (60,88). The most common soils on which it grows in North America occur in the orders Histosols, Inceptisols, and Entisols.",Soils and Topography,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,15,0
"European alder is valuable f-or wildlife. Because the cones open gradually and release seed throughout the winter, they are a dependable source of food for seed-eating birds such as pine siskins and goldfinches. European alder is recommended for use in shelterbelts to provide cover for pheasants. When combined with Prunus laurocerasus and Sorbus aria it makes a compact planting suitable for establishment adjacent to cropland (34). Alders have been recommended for afforestation of disturbed areas throughout much of the temperate world (46,52). Their tolerance of low pH and their rapid growth, abundant leaf litter production, and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen combine to make European alder especially desirable for planting on spoil banks, which typically contain little organic matter and available nitrogen. Establishing European alder on mined sites apparently improves their suitability for earthworm habitat. Ten adult Lumbricus terrestris worms were released in a 4-year-old A. glutinosa plantation growing on calcareous coal spoil in southern Ohio. After 5 years the population had increased to 60/m' (6/ft') as far as 15 m (50 ft) from the point of introduction and was apparently still increasing, with obvious desirable implications for hastening soil development (97). Alder is useful in urban forestry. A system for producing containerized alder seedlings suitable for park and roadside planting has been described. Trees grown in Iowa according to these methods averaged 94 cm (37 in) tall after only 8 months (19). Biomass use of European alder has potential. On a river terrace site in northern Alabama, 6-year-old European alder produced more than six times as much volume per tree as sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) of the same age (22). Alders in southern Illinois, planted at only 998 trees per hectare (404/acre) on a bottom-land site, produced 54.7 t/ha (24.4 ton/acre) at age 9 (dry weight of entire tree, above ground) (72). Alder may be a more promising species to grow in short-rotation, intensive-culture plantations for cattle feed. Protein yield was nearly that of alfalfa (3). Aboveground parts of European alder have energy values of about 5 Kcal/g (9,000 Btu/Ib) dry weight. Calorific value of branchwood is 10 percent greater than that of bolewood (43).",Special Uses,European Alder,alnus,glutinosa,hardwood,16,0
"European black pine in its many forms grows naturally throughout the Mediterranean region in association with Scotch pine, Swiss mountain pine (Pinus mugo), Aleppo pine (P. halepensis), Italian stone pine (P. pinea), and Heldreich pine (P. heldreichii) (11,40,69). Other pine species that share the same geographic range or portions of it with European black pine include Swiss stone pine (P. cembra), Balkan pine (P. peuce), maritime pine (P. pinaster), and P. brutia and its variant P. pithyusa (11). In England some naturally regenerating European black pines, from principally Corsican sources, are associated with birch (Betula pendula), willows (Salix caprea and S. cinerea), and oak (Quercus robur) on the sand dunes, saltmarshes, and intertidal sand and mudflats of the north Norfolk coast (27). In the United States, European black pine is associated with numerous species consequent to its use in landscape and environmental plantings. Its apparent tendency to escape, possibly to naturalize, and to hybridize with certain other pines may, in time, result in some natural species associations in this country.",Associated Forest Cover,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,1,1
"In parts of its native European habitat, black pine grows in a cool to cold temperate climate (23). The northern varieties are very frost-hardy, withstanding temperatures of -30° C (-22° F), and the southern varieties tolerate -7° C (19° F) temperatures. Annual precipitation varies from 610 to 1020 mm (24 to 40 in). The species has been shown to carry on photosynthesis at -5° C (23° F), with respiration still detectable at -19° C (-2° F) (21). Black pine withstands the weight of ice well and is considered hardy except in the coldest, hottest, and driest regions. In the United States, black pine is mainly suited to Climatic Zone IV, which includes most of Nova Scotia, southern Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, southern Ontario, Michigan, northern Indiana, northern Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, northern Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, southwestern Alberta, and central British Columbia (52). It has either failed or has performed poorly in the southern states of Oklahoma, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, northern Florida, and Arkansas.",Climate,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,2,1
"European black pine is native to Europe. Its range extends from longitude 5° W. in Spain and Morocco to about 40° E. in eastern Turkey; and from latitude 35° N. in Morocco and Cyprus to 48° N. in northeastern Austria and to 45° N. latitude in the Crimea, U.S.S.R. (11). Black pine grows widely throughout southern Europe from the eastern half of Spain, southern France, and Italy to Austria; south throughout Yugoslavia, western Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece on the BalkanPeninsula; east to southern Russia in the Crimea and south to Turkey; and on the islands of Cyprus, Sicily, and Corsica, with outliers in Algeria and Morocco (40). Black pine is hardy in southern Ontario and New England, the North Central United States, and in parts of the West; and, along with Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris), Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii), and Japanese red pine (P. densiflora), it is reported to have become naturalized in parts of New England and the Lake States (72). Its escape from cultivation locally in the northeast, and west to Missouri, is acknowledged, but it is not generally recognized as having become naturalized (36). The ecotypic variation in wide-ranging species such as P. nigra normally includes sufficient morphological variation that taxonomists have recognized many nomenclaturally distinct species, subspecies, or varieties to describe this variation. In this paper, for simplicity, the species are referred to by geographic origin, for example, European black pine or black pine from Austria, the Balkans, or Corsica, rather than by subspecies or varietal names.

"Within the climatically and topographically diverse and disjunct distribution of European black pine, recognizable differences in the population have evolved through natural selection. As early as the third century B.C., Theophrastis (370-285 B.C.) recognized several striking variations within what is here called Pinus nigra.",Genetics,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,7,1
"Reports of natural hybridization between European black pine and other pine species in Europe include: Pinus nigra and P. montana (58), P. nigra and P. sylvestris (65), and P. nigra and P. heldreichii var. leucodermis (22), although P. heldreichii is considered synonymous with P. nigra by many. In the United States, natural hybridization has been reported between Pinus nigra and Japanese red pine (P. densiflora) in planted stands within close proximity of one another (71); although research based on enzyme analyses, suggests that red pine cannot be the pollen donor in this naturally occurring putative hybrid (41). Ninety-two percent of the seedlings derived from open-pollinated cones collected from the black pine stand were hybrids, and heterosis was evident in these seedlings. Cones yielded 22 filled seeds per cone. These are considered among the easiest of all tree hybrids to produce, providing the concentration of P. densiflora pollen in the pollen mix is very high (63). Early attempts at artificial crossing of European black pine with other pine species were mostly unsuccessful. Species included Pinus resinosa, P. sylvestris, P. thunbergii, P. caribeae, and P. rigida (13,37,53). Later, Pinus nigra was successfully fertilized by P. resinosa to produce progenies superior to either parent (17). P. nigra has been reciprocally crossed successfully with P. densiflora (35,66,70,71), P. sylvestris (65,70), and P. thunbergii; and with P. tabulaeformis, P. taiwanensus (70), and P. mugo (67). In addition to the crosses shown above, the following combinations have been achieved using P. nigra and P. sylvestris as the mother tree: P. nigra x (P. thunbergii x densiflora) P. nigra x (P. densiflora x nigra) P. nigra x (P. nigra x densiflora) P. sylvestris x (P. densiflora x nigra) The application of genetic principles, including testing and selecting adapted seed sources (provenances), followed by intraspecific and interspecific breeding of individuals selected from within adapted seed sources, promises further improvement in the form, disease resistance, vigor, and other economically important characteristics of P. nigra.",Hybrids,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,9,1
"The taxonomic record indicates that Pinus nigra is an extremely variable taxon, including more than 100 Latin specific, varietal, and formal names. Common names associated with the species include black pine, Austrian pine, ""tsrnog bor,"" and ""crnog bora."" There is no general agreement on its nomenclature. Among the several major treatments of the taxon, each based on solid work, there are differences in certain aspects (5,12,13,14,15,22,52). Two commonly accepted authorities (12,52) are in general agreement, however, each partitioning the species into four varieties, the first of which describes the type: Pinus nigra var. austriaca (Hoess) Aschers. & Graebn. (Austria to Balkan Peninsula) (52) P. n. var. nigra Arnold (Austria, Yugoslavia, Hungary) (12) P. n. var. caramanica (Loud.) Rehd. (Asia Minor) (52) P. n. var. caramanica (Loud.) Rehd. (Crimea) (12) P. n. var. poiretiana (Ant.) Aschers. & Graebn. (So. Europe) (52) P. n. var. maritima (Aiton) Melville (Spain, Corsica, So. Italy, Greece) (12) P. n. var. cebennensis (Gren. & Gord.) Rehd. (Pyrenees & So. France) (52) P. n. var. cebennensis (Gren. & Gord.) Rehd. (Cévennes & Pyrenees) (12) Blecic (5) treated European black pine as a series of subspecies as follows: Pinus nigra ssp. nigra (Austria, Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia) P. n. ssp. salzmannii (France, Northern Pyrenees, Central and Eastern Spain) P. n. ssp. laricio (Corsica, Calabria, Sicily) P. n. ssp. dalmatica (central region of the Yugolslav seaboard and neighboring islands) P. n. ssp. pallasiana (Balkan Peninsula, Southern Carpathians, the Crimea) Other treatments of the taxon have resulted in assignment of subspecies rank to segments of the population: Pinus nigra ssp. occidentalis with 6 named varieties, and P. n. ssp. orientalis with as many as 10 named varieties (13). Recent genetic analyses of the European black pine population have added further refinements either confirming, expanding, or compositing the already established nomenclature (2,32,33,54,55,67,68,69). Recent isoenzyme (20,44) and karyotic (28) analyses have further differentiated European black pine into identifiable groups.",Hybrids,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,9,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- European black pine is monoecious, with staminate (microsporangiate) and ovulate (megasporangiate) strobili borne separately on the same tree (67). Staminate strobili, clustered at the base of new shoots, mostly on older lateral branches in the lower crown, are cylindrical, short-stalked, bright yellow, about 2 cm (0.8 in) long with numerous scales, and contain pollen in great quantity (12,49,52). One or two ovulate strobili (conelets) emerge near the end of the new growth of terminal and lateral branches; they are cylindrical, small, bright red, and short-stalked or sessile (12,49,67). Pollen dispersal and conelet receptivity occur from May to June. Individual ovulate conelets are receptive for the pollen for only about 3 days, however (67). After pollen dispersal, the staminate strobili dry and fall within several weeks. The scales of the ovulate strobili close within a few days of pollination, and the conelets begin a slow developmental process. At the beginning of the second growing season, the ovulate strobili are only about 2 cm (0.8 in) long (47). Fertilization takes place in the spring or early summer about 13 months after pollination, and the cones, now turned green in color begin to grow rapidly from about May until maturity in the fall (67). The fruit, a tough, coarse, woody, yellow-green cone during the pre-ripening second summer, changes to shiny yellow-brown to light brown at maturity from September to November of the second growing season (12,49,52). Cones are descending, sessile, ovoid, and 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) long. Cone scales are shiny, thickened at the apex, and end in a short spine on the dorsal umbo. Minimum seed bearing age is 15 to 40 years (40,52,67). In England, black pine from Corsican sources produce their first heavy cone crops at ages 25 to 30 years and reach maximum production between 60 and 90 years of age (27). The interval between large cone crops is 2 to 5 years. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are dispersed from October through November of the second growing season. Seeds are reddish brown, often mottled, 6.4 mm (0.25 in) long at one end of a membranous wing 19 mm (0.75 in) long (49). Two winged seeds are produced on the upper surface of each scale of the cone except for those at the tip and base. Seeds are extracted from harvested cones by air-drying for 3 to 10 days or kiln-drying at 46° C (115° F) for 24 hours. Sound seeds are separated from empty seeds by flotation in 95 percent ethanol (31). The number of sound seeds per cone in Austrian black pine ranges from 30 to 40, of which 15 to 20 are germinable (67). Cleaned seeds average 57,300 per kilogram (26,000/lb) with a range from 30,900 to 86,000/kg (14,000 to 39,000/lb). Seeds from the Crimea, Turkey, and Cyprus tend to be the largest, ranging from 38,600 to 45,900/kg (17,500 to 20,800/lb), and those from Corsica the smallest, ranging from 61,700 to 79,400/kg (28,000 to 36,000/lb) (31,67). Seedling Development- European black pine is easily grown from seed and transplants well. Fresh seeds require no pre-sowing stratification; but stored seeds can be cold-stratified up to 60 days to hasten germination. Ninety-nine percent germination was obtained from seeds stored 10 years in closed containers at 6.6 percent moisture content (ovendry-weight basis) at 0° to 2° C (32° to 36° F). No loss of viability occurred in seeds stored in sealed containers at room temperature after 2 years. Storage at moisture contents as low as 2 percent or as high as 12 percent, however, was detrimental to seeds stored for long periods (25). A light period of 8 hours at 30° C (86° F) and a dark period of 20° C (68° F) for 16 hours is recommended for germination (24). Germination is epigeal (31). Seeds from Corsican sources tend to germinate more slowly than those from Austria and Calabria (55). In nurseries, nonstratified seeds are sown in the fall or spring, at a density to obtain 540 to 650 seedlings per square meter (50 to 60/ft²). Seeds should be sown at a depth of 13 to 19 mm (0.5 to 0.75 in). Black pine seedlings can be produced in peat-perlite containers using low rates of fertilizers (e.g. Osmocote 18N-2.6P-10K) (1). Experiments with 3-year-old nursery seedlings from 27 different European provenance locations demonstrated that nitrogen and manganese ion uptake was significantly enhanced, but that uptake of potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, boron, zinc, and aluminum ions was suppressed by 45 percent urea (33). Application of a pre-emergence herbicide was found to enhance mycorrhizal formation in nursery-grown seedlings (61). In Germany, seedlings of all provenances of black pine from Corsica, Spain, and southern France suffered severe frost damage in the nursery, and those from southern Italy suffered some damage; but seedlings from eastern provenances (Austria, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Cyprus) were undamaged (54). Experience in the United States strongly suggests that black pine seed be obtained from the Balkan Peninsula or from the Crimea, for improved winter hardiness (32). Nursery-grown seedlings are commonly field-planted as 2-0, 2-1, or 2-2 seedlings. Field-plantable seedlings can be greenhouse grown in containers in 9 months following a predetermined schedule of temperature, moisture, relative humidity, and nutrient application (62). In England, germination success of direct-sown Corsican black pine seed was found to be strongly dependent on aspect; satisfactory germination was achieved on north-facing slopes on young sand dunes nearest the sea (27). Newly germinated seedlings suffered very heavy losses from voles and rabbits but became unpalatable to them within 2 months. Vegetative Reproduction- At present, grafting is the most common method for vegetatively propagating European black pine. Needle fascicles have been rooted, but only fascicles from 1-year-old short shoots on young (5-year-old) plants were able to form callus or to root. Propagation by cuttings and air-layering has not been reported. The side graft method is the usual practice, but cleft and veneer grafts can also be used. Grafting is done on actively growing stock, and removal of the stock by pruning must be gradual after scion growth begins. Stock-scion incompatibility in black pine is not a serious problem, especially if the stock and the scion are of the same race. Black pine can be grafted onto Pinus sylvestris, P. resinosa, P. khasya, P. montana, P. mugo, and P. contorta; but semi-incompatibility has been found with P. ponderosa, P. radiata, and P. armandii (67). Research in Yugoslavia indicates that a wide range of auxin concentrations, can promote the development of rootable plantlets from shoot tip explants (30).",Reproduction and Early Growth,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- European black pine transplants well when small, or when larger if transplanted in the dormant season (49). It is a fast and vigorously growing tree of pyramidal form with full, dark foliage. In England, its habit has been described as bushy in youth, presenting a coarse appearance and having poor stem form; this severely limits its timber value, although it grows rapidly, is hardy, and provides an excellent windbreak (6). In the Great Plains region black pine grows relatively rapidly during the first 20 years after planting-approximately 0.3 m (1 ft) per year on the average site (57). Similar rates of growth have been reported in Iowa, where 12-year-old trees average 3.9 m (12.9 ft) in height (19). The fastest growing source in a Nebraska provenance study, a disease resistant source from Yugoslavia, was 5.9 m (19.4 ft) tall at age 12 (51) and 9.7 m (31.8 ft) tall at age 20 (64). Average heights of 4.4 m (14.5 ft) and diameters of 13.5 cm (5.3 in) were recorded in a 15-year-old Michigan provenance plantation (68). The average growth rate of European black pine in Great Plains shelterbelts decreases 7.6 cm (3.0 in) per year from about age 20, so that annual height increase is only 6.1 to 9.1 cm (2.4 to 3.6 in) 50 years after planting. Height growth in the Loess Plains of Nebraska compares favorably with height growth in Europe up to age 50. Height growth in Europe, however, is slower during the early years and faster after 40 to 50 years (57). A 25-year-old stand of planted black pine in Michigan State University's Kellogg Forest is similar in growth to red pine stands on the same forest and, like them, is being thinned for pulpwood and pruned for timber production (69). Use of faster growing black pine sources does not cause the production of lower wood quality (34). Forest plantings established in the North Central and Northeastern United States during recent decades are generally thrifty. Data on growth of older stands, however, is limited to a few relatively small plantings, such as the group of 50-year-old trees in the University of Michigan's Nichols Arboretum at Ann Arbor. These trees are similar in growth rate to nearby red pine, Scotch pine, and eastern white pine (P. strobus) (69). European black pine, in the Secrest Arboretum at Ohio State University's Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wooster, OH, has performed as follows (3): At age 45, the above trees would produce about 0.4 m³ (14 ft³) of wood per tree. Height growth of Corsican material in England was proportional to the preceding winter's rainfall from October to March if soil moisture was below field capacity, and volume increment was proportional to the preceding year's height growth. Diameter growth began when the mean 5-day temperature rose to 10° C (50° F) and ended when the mean temperature fell below 10° C (50° F) (56). Wood density of Corsican black pine grown in England was higher than that of other commercially grown exotics, and resin contents as high as 20 percent were found in the heartwood of individual trees (10). European black pine matures at about 80 years of age, commonly developing a flat, round, or spreading crown. The species attains heights of 20.1 to 50.3 m (66 to 165 ft) (52,69). Minimum rotation periods of 160 to 180 years have been reported for black pine in Corsica, 240 to 360 years being the normal to produce trees 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter (12). Rooting Habit- All varieties of European black pine are considered to be deep laterally rooted and, therefore, to perform best in deep soils (22,49). Reaction to Competition- European black pine is classed as intolerant of shade, and, therefore, must be planted in situations where it will receive full sunlight. Those from Austria and the Balkans have received increasing attention during recent decades from foresters and Christmas tree growers in the Northeastern United States as an alternative to red pine, which has been heavily damaged by the European pine shoot moth (Rhyacionia buoliana). It has proven especially successful on soils of high pH in the southern part of the area formerly planted to red pine (69). At Ithaca, NY, a series of four-paired, quarter-acre plots of red pine and black pine were established on a series of somewhat poorly drained to excessively well-drained acidic, silty loam, and other associated soils typical of New York's southern tier, to compare their performances. After 21 growing seasons, black pine averaged about 1.8 m (6 ft) in height and 3.2 cm (1.25 in) in diameter less than red pine over all sites. Branches were usually thicker and closer together, suggesting slower early height growth; stems suffered sapsucker damage, and the trees had many double forks and malformed shoots. These tests suggested that European black pine, from this source at least, was a poor choice to replace red pine on many northeastern sites (42). In the Great Plains shelterbelt planting, European black pine was frequently intermixed with ponderosa pine within the same row. Survival was about 5 percent better and height growth was about 0.7 m (2.3 ft) more for black pine over a 12- to 19-year period on the deep to medium, permeable, well-drained silty and sandy loams of loess origin (50). Heights of trees also were more uniform within black pine rows because of freedom from damage by tip moths (Rhyacionia spp.). Density and form of crowns also were superior to ponderosa pine. In West Virginia, 10 sources of European black pine, ponderosa pine, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), and European alder (Alnus glutinosa) were tested on strip mine spoils. Although all hardwood species grew faster than the pines, Yugoslavian sources grew faster and survived best of all other black pine sources (29). Damaging Agents- European black pine is susceptible to infection by many pathogens that damage seedlings, foliage, stems, and roots (26). Damping-off and seedling root rots, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora cactorum, and Pythium debaryanum, and loss of seedling vigor caused by the dagger nematode (Xiphinema americanum) (45) are among the most common causes of seedling damage in nurseries. Dothistroma needle blight, caused by the fungus Dothistroma pini, is one of the most damaging of the foliage diseases of black pine. The fungus has been found in 23 States in the United States and in three Provinces in Canada. Dothistroma needle blight is widespread and causes extensive damage to Austrian pine in Christmas tree plantings in Minnesota (43), and in shelterbelt, ornamental, and Christmas tree plantings in the central and southern Great Plains (48). Infection of current-year needles first occurs in mid-July, while infection of second-year needles begins in late May in the Great Plains and in British Columbia. Symptoms develop in early September to early November and consist of yellow and tan spots and bands that appear water-soaked on the needles. The bands and spots may turn brown to reddish brown, and the distal end of the needle becomes chlorotic, then necrotic, while the base of the needle remains green. Infected needles are cast prematurely (46). Genetic resistance to Dothistroma needle blight has been detected in European black pine. In a Nebraska test of 21 geographic sources (51), some individual trees within 16 sources were highly resistant, while those from one Yugoslavian source showed universally high resistance (48). Lophodermium needle cast of pines, caused by Lophodermium pinastri, is a serious disease of European black pine in the Lake States, causing browning and premature dropping of needles and terminal bud dieback (60). A needle disease caused by the fungus Nemacyclus minor has been reported from Pennsylvania (38). Diplodia tip blight, caused by the fungus Diplodia pinea, is a very damaging twig and stem disease of European black pine, especially to trees more than 30 years old. Entire new shoots are killed rapidly by the fungus. Trees repeatedly infected have some branches killed back to the main stem (47). Black pine seedlings in nurseries are susceptible to the fungi Cylindrocladium scoparium and C. floridanum. These fungi cause root rot, damping-off, and needle blight (9). Damage to black pine by insects and other pests is apparently of lesser consequence than that from fungal pathogens. The species has been reported to be injured by pine aphids, pine beetles, and pine weevils, but growing trees, on the whole, are relatively free from insect pests (12). Damage by rabbits and sapsuckers has been noted (19,42). Some incidence of attack in northeastern United States from the Zimmerman pine moth (Dioryctria zimmermani), the European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer), and the European pine shoot moth has been observed (68).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,14,1
"European black pine is adapted to many soil types and topographic habitats. In its native range the species commonly is separated into three geographic groupings: western, central, and eastern. Sources from southern France and Spain, the western group, often are indifferent to soil type; sources from Corsica, Italy, and Sicily, the central group, grow poorly on limestone soils; while sources from the Balkans and the Crimea, U.S.S.R., the eastern group, appear to do well on the poorer limestone soils (31). Black pine also grows well on podzolic soils (8). In England, Austrian material does well as a shelterbelt tree in exposed situations near the sea on light, dry, shallow soils, sands, chalks, and limestone. It is less well-suited than Corsican strains in infertile, ""stiff,"" or wet soils (6). Although European black pine often is found on poor, calcareous, sandy, and even pure limestone soils, it requires a deep soil. On good sites, Italian, Sicilian, and Corsican strains are fast growing (up to 40 m or 131 ft tall) and straight (23,40). In Europe, black pine is found at elevations ranging from 250 to 1800 m (820 to 5,910 ft). In Austria, it is found on poor dolomite and limestone sites from 260 to 500 m (850 to 1,640 ft) and on good soils from 300 to 700 m (980 to 2,300 ft); at about 610 m (2,000 ft) in the Dinaric Alps of the Balkans; at 1200 m (3,940 ft) in the Sierra de Segura of southeastern Spain; and from 900 to 1800 m (2,950 to 5,910 ft) on Corsica (40). In the United States the major experience with European black pine has been with Austrian sources. Most planting stock is provided by private nurseries, and several million trees are produced annually in the Northeastern States. The species has been especially successful in the Northeast on soils of high pH in the southern part of the area formerly planted to red pine (Pinus resinosa) (69). There is evidence, however, that black pine is not a good choice to replace red pine on many northeastern sites (42). After 21 growing seasons, black pine averaged about 2.1 m (7 ft) shorter and 3.2 cm (1.25 in) less in d.b.h. on several New York soil types. In the Great Plains region, European black pine is not a demanding species and is being planted on soils of the orders Aridisols, Entisols, Mollisols, and Vertisols. More specifically it grows well throughout a broad range of soils including sandy loams, silty clays, and calcareous soils. It is about as adaptable to most Great Plains windbreak and shelterbelt sites as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), although on the very poor sites it suffers considerable mortality. Once established, however, the rate of height growth is good, and density and form of the crown are superior to ponderosa pine (50). Survival, height, vigor, and crown development throughout the Great Plains region are best in deep, permeable, well-drained, and mostly sandy loams along river lowlands and stream valleys where the water table is 6.1 m (20 ft) or less below the surface; they are poorest on shallow, sandy, or silty soils underlain by claypan or gravel. After early success in the turn of the century plantings in the Nebraska Sandhills, black pine was not considered as desirable for extensive plantings as eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or ponderosa pine. In Iowa, black pine was reported to be tolerant of high-lime soils, where survival and growth were best on western and northern exposures (19).",Soils and Topography,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,15,1
"European black pine is a widespread and important timber-producing tree of central and southern Europe, especially Corsica. The wood resembles Scotch pine but is rougher, softer in texture, and possesses less strength. Although the wood has a relatively larger proportion of sapwood to heartwood and thus requires a long rotation, it is used extensively throughout the Mediterranean region for general construction, fuelwood, and other purposes for which pine timber is needed (12). Elsewhere, black pine has been grown more for estate and landscape uses than as a timber crop, although in England during World War II it proved serviceable for box boards and pit props. The species has been planted extensively in cold, semi-arid, exposed coastal regions for protection and sand dune fixation because of its capacity to withstand drought, to grow on light, dry sandy soils of low productivity, and to tolerate fill (6). This frost-hardy, windfirm, and light-demanding species has been widely used for nearly 100 years in windbreaks and roadside plantings throughout the eastern Great Plains of the United States, where its dense foliage and stiff branches withstand wind, ice, and heavy snow. The species has not been widely grown in the United States for timber production, although estate, school, and experimental plantings have been thinned for pulpwood and timber products (69). It is occasionally tapped for resin, but its pitch is not as high in quality as that of slash pine (Pinus elliottii). European black pine is grown for Christmas trees in the North Central and Northeastern States (34) where it is not subject to heavy damage from the European shoot moth and tip moth, but where it is severely damaged by Dothistroma, Lophodermium, and Diplodia needle and tip blights. It is being increasingly used in urban and industrial environmental improvement plantings because of its rapid growth and protoplasmic insensitivity to salt spray (4) and to industrial dust, dry soil, and smoke containing sulfur dioxide (7). Excised shoots of black pine and other conifer species are capable of absorbing more S02, N02, and 03 than shoots of a number of deciduous species (18). It also provides wildlife habitat and might be used as a wood source (39).",Special Uses,European Black Pine,pinus,nigra,conifer,16,1
"Florida torreya is not included among the forest cover types established by the Society of American Foresters but is commonly known to be among the oak-gum-cypress or oak-pine types. In 1919, it made up about 4 percent of the forest along the Apalachicola River. The most commonly associated species are beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), American holly (Ilex opaca), Florida maple (Acer barbatum), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), spruce pine (P. glabra), white oak (Quercus alba), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). Shrubs and lianas associated with Florida torreya are poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), crossvine (Bignonia capreolata), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), Florida yew (Taxus floridana), blackberry and dewberry (Rubus spp.). Forbs, grasses, and sedges include sedges (Carex spp.), panic grass (Panicum spp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), little sweet Betsy (Trillium cuneatum), giant cane (Arundinaria gigantea), and American climbing fern (Lygodium palmatum) (4,5,6).",Associated Forest Cover,Florida Torreya,torreya,taxifolia,conifer,1,1
"The climate of the region in the Florida Panhandle where Torreya taxifolia grows is warm and humid, with a wet summer and dry fall and winter. Average rainfall is 810 to 860 mm (32 to 34 in) during the growing season from April 1 to September 30, while the average yearly rainfall totals 1420 mm (56 in). The growing season averages 270 days. Killing frosts usually occur between November 25 and February 28. The average January temperature is 12° C (54° F), while the average July temperature is 27° C (81° F). Occasional cold waves in the winter bring a minimum temperature of -9° to -7° C (15° to 20° F).

"No population differences have been observed in this species. No natural hybrids occur because this species is separated from its nearest North American relative, T. californica, by more than 2090 km (1,300 mi). If Florida torreya is to be preserved, it will be necessary to isolate and propagate blight-resistant trees. Such genetic material may be propagated from Torreya taxifolia cuttings because they root readily. Once the seedlings are well established, they may be outplanted in suitable habitats along the Apalachicola River. A number of diseased Florida torreya up to 9 m (30 ft) in height are growing in the Maclay State Gardens, FL. There are 14 disease-free specimens on the Biltmore Estate, Asheville, NC, that are more than 40 years old and up to 12 m (40 ft) tall but it is unlikely that they are blight resistant. Seeds and cuttings from the Biltmore Estate should be used to perpetuate disease-free trees inside and outside the species' natural range. All of the species at the Maclay Gardens as well as any accessible trees in their natural habitat should be treated for fungal infection if Torreya taxifolia is not to become extinct.",Genetics,Florida Torreya,torreya,taxifolia,conifer,7,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- Florida torreya is dioecious. Female flowers are produced in March and April and the ovule develops in a sessile, arillate structure. At the end of the second season, the fertilized ovule forms a single, nearly globose gray-blue fruit 2.5 to 4.1 cm (1.0 to 1.6 in) long, 1.9 to 3.6 cm (0.75 to 1.4 in) wide, which matures as early as August or as late as early November. Staminate cones are also initiated in March and April. These are small, globular-ovate, and bear four pollen sacs on each scale. Torreya taxifolia first produces male and female cones at age 20 (2,8,9). Seed Production and Dissemination- Little is known about germination of Torreya taxifolia seeds; they may germinate without stratification. According to R. Bowden at the Maclay State Gardens in Tallahassee, FL, some seeds germinated when placed in rich, damp topsoil. At Maclay, Bowden is currently investigating the physiological requirements for Torreya taxifolia germination. He has obtained 80 percent germination of 35 seeds by placing them in wet sphagnum moss (2). Germination is hypogeal. Torreya taxifolia requires an after-ripening period before germination as does its closest American relative, T. californica (8,9). Seedling Development- Little is known about seedling development because few seedlings have been produced in the wild since the species was infected by a blight in the late 1950's. Perhaps mycorrhizae are beneficial to seedling establishment and growth. Seedlings in their natural habitat have developed in the deep shade of hardwoods and pines. Vegetative Reproduction- Florida torreya can perpetuate itself vegetatively by producing sprouts at the base of the parent tree, although, in almost every instance, only one sprout survives after several years. Probably every existing Florida torreya in its present native habitat is a product of vegetative reproduction.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Florida Torreya,torreya,taxifolia,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- The bark on mature trees is about 1.3 cm (0.5 in) thick and irregularly divided by shallow fissures. The dark-brown outer bark often is tinged with orange while the inner bark is yellow. The twigs are green and stiff. The leaves are green, lustrous, stiff, and pungent. The common name, stinking-cedar, is derived from the disagreeable odor given off when any part of the tree is bruised. Florida torreya is a small tree with whorled branches, reaching 12 m (40 ft) in height and 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 in) in d.b.h. Its habitat on steep bluffs and its small stature and low population have made its exploitation impractical, and the species has never been commercially important (3,8). Rooting Habit- Florida torreya seedlings have a well-branched taproot. A 5-cm (2-in) seedling produces a taproot 5 cm (2 in) long. No information is available on root growth and the development of mature trees. Reaction to Competition- Florida torreya appears to grow better in full sunlight at the Maclay State Gardens than in the dense shade of its natural habitat. It may most accurately be classed as tolerant of shade in its native habitat. No information on competition is available, however. Damaging Agents- Godfrey and Kurz examined populations of Torreya taxifolia in 1962 and observed that many trees were infected by fungi that cause a stem and needle blight. They reported that many areas where the species previously thrived contained only a few skeletal trunks, some with abortive sprouts at their bases. The fungi responsible for the blight appear to be Physalospora spp. and Macrophoma spp., but investigators have not determined precisely how the fungal agents act to cause the blight. There is speculation that a sexual stage of the causal agent may be necessary to establish the infection and that the condition or age of the tree may be the important factor. Researchers found that the commercial fungicide Maneb at a concentration of 671 g per 378 liters (1.5 lb per 100 gal) applied at weekly intervals resulted in good control over 9 weeks of treatment, and that treated trees recovered markedly and produced new growth with little or no infection (1,5).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Florida Torreya,torreya,taxifolia,conifer,14,1

"The wide geographical range of flowering dogwood, and the diverse soils on which it is found, is indicative of a large number of associated species. Dogwood is specifically mentioned in 22 of the 90 Society of American Foresters forest cover types (3). Cover types range from Jack Pine (Type 1) and Beech - Sugar Maple (Type 60) in the North to Longleaf Pine (Type 70) in the South. Common associates include white, red, and black oaks Quercus alba, Q. falcata, Q. velutina), yellow-poplar, sassafras (Sassafras albidum), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and longleaf, loblolly, shortleaf, slash, and Virginia pines (Pinus palustris, P. taeda, P, echinata, P. elliottii, and P. virginiana).

"Precipitation within the range of flowering dogwood varies from 760 mm (30 in) in the North to 2030 mm (80 in) in the southern Appalachians. Warm season precipitation varies from about 510 mm (20 in) in southern Michigan to 860 mm (34 in) in northern Florida, and annual snowfall ranges from none in Florida to more than 127 cm (50 in) in the North (15). Average annual temperature is 21° C (70° F) in the South and 7° C (45° F) in the North, with temperature extremes of 46° to -34° C (115° to -30° F). Growing season ranges from 160 days in southern Michigan to more than 300 days in Florida (12).",Climate,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,2,0
"Near the northern limits of its range, flowering dogwood becomes a many-branched shrub (15). Other than this, little is known of population differences other than the tendency for fruit weights to decrease with decreasing latitude and increasing length of growing season (16). More than 20 cultivars of flowering dogwood are sold commercially in the United States (17). Four clones of flowering dogwood most commonly propagated as ornamentals are Cornus florida f. pendula (Dipp.) Schelle, with pendulous branches, Cornus florida f. rubra (West.) Schelle, with red or pink involucral bracts, Cornus florida f. pluribracteata Rehder, with six to eight large and several small bracts on the inflorescence, and Cornus florida f. xanthocarpa Rehder, with yellow fruit. Another cultivar, called Welchii, has yellow and red variegated leaves and is offered commercially (17). In addition to these clones, Cornus florida var. urbaniana, a variety found in the mountains of Nuevo León and Veracruz, Mexico, differs from the typical species by its grayer twigs and larger fruit (15). Flowering dogwood is not known to hybridize with other species.",Genetics,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,7,0
"The range of flowering dogwood extends from extreme southwestern Maine west to New York, extreme southern Ontario, central Michigan, central Illinois, and central Missouri; south to extreme southeast Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, east Texas; and east to north Florida. A variety also grows in the mountains of Nuevo León and Veracruz, Mexico (11). -The native range of flowering dogwood.",Native Range,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowering dogwood has many crowded, small, yellowish perfect flowers, borne in terminal clusters in the spring before the leaves appear, and surrounded by four snow-white, petal-like bracts. The bracts form ""flowers"" 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) across and provide a spectacular display in the springtime. Occasionally, trees with salmon-colored or light-pink bracts are found in nature. Pink and red flowering dogwoods and other cultivars with special ornamental characteristics are commonly propagated from clones by commercial nurseries. Dates of flowering range from mid-March in the South to late May in the North. The clustered fruits of flowering dogwood are bright red drupes about 13 mm. (0.5 in) long and 6 mm (0.25 in) in diameter with thin, mealy flesh. Each fruit contains a two-celled, usually two-seeded, bony stone. In many stones, only one seed is fully developed. The fruits ripen from September to late October (10). Trees grown from seed commonly flower and produce fruits when 6 years old. Flowers also have been observed on trees of sprout origin at 6 years, when stump diameter is 19 mm (0.75 in), and height is 1.2 m (4 ft). Seed Production and Dissemination- Dogwood usually produces a good seed crop every other year, but seeds on isolated trees are frequently empty. Thus, seed collections should be made from groups of trees. In a Texas study, 88 percent or more of trees 9 cm (3.4 in) in d.b.h. and larger bore fruit each year. Year-to-year differences were more pronounced in the smaller diameter classes. Average fruit production was 185 kg/m² of basal area (37.9 lb/ft²) (9). The yield of stones per kilogram of fruit ranges from 0.19 to 0.46 kg (19 to 46 lb/100 lb of fruit). The average number of cleaned stones per kilogram is 9,920 (4,500/lb). Clean, air-dried stones may be stored in sealed containers at 3° C (38° F) for 2 to 4 years (2). Birds and other animals are the primary agents of seed dissemination, although some seeds are scattered by gravity. Seedling Development- Natural germination of flowering dogwood usually occurs in the spring following seedfall, but some seeds do not germinate until the second spring. Germination is epigeal. Stratification of freshly collected seed at 5° C (41° F) for periods up to 120 days is recommended for overcoming embryo dormancy (2). Seedlings usually show rapid root growth. In one greenhouse study, an average 6-month-old seedling had 3,000 roots with a total length of 51.2 in (168 ft), compared to 800 roots with a total length of 3.7 in (12 ft) for loblolly pine (15). This species grows nearly all summer but stops temporarily during periods of adverse conditions. In a Massachusetts nursery, flowering dogwood displayed a height growth pattern different from that of any other species studied. Seedlings grew from April 24 to September 4, and 90 percent of the growth occurred from May 15 to August 18. The most rapid growth occurred during the first week of August (10). In a North Carolina Piedmont study, flowering dogwood seedlings were planted under three situations: (1) in an open field, (2) under pine stands, and (3) on the margins of pine stands. Survival was significantly higher on the margins of pine stands than on the other two sites, but there was no significant difference in survival between the open field and the pine forest. The intermediate light intensity of the margins apparently provided some advantage. Growth of seedlings was greater in the open than on the margin of the pine forest. Seedlings in the forest were smallest (15). Transplanting flowering dogwood seedlings with a root ball is preferred over bare-root transplanting, although both methods can be successful (4). Plants entering their third year are well suited for planting in permanent locations. Plants of this age are usually 0.6 to 1 in (2 to 3 ft) tall and can be lifted easily without excessive disturbance of the root system. Vegetative Reproduction- Flowering dogwood reproduces by sprouting and sprouts most profusely when cut in late winter. Height growth of sprouts is known to increase with increasing stump diameter. The species also reproduces extensively by layering. Other means of vegetative propagation include softwood cuttings in summer, hardwood cuttings in winter, grafting in winter or spring, suckers and divisions in spring, and budding in the summer. Vegetative reproduction is necessary to propagate plants for characteristics such as fruit retention and color of bracts and fruit. Flowering dogwood roots readily from cuttings taken in June or immediately after the plants bloom. Cuttings from young trees usually show better growth and survival after rooting than cuttings from mature trees. Only terminal shoot tips trimmed to about 8 cm (3 in) in length and retaining two to four leaves should be used. Bases of cuttings should be dipped in a mixture of indolebutyric acid crystals and talc, one part acid crystals to 250 parts talc by weight (10). Cuttings are then set about 3 cm (1.2 in) deep in the rooting medium and grown under a mist with a photoperiod of at least 18 hours. The red form of flowering dogwood is difficult to start from cuttings and usually is propagated by budding in late summer or grafting in winter (6).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The maximum size obtained by a flowering dogwood is 16.8 in (55 ft) in height and 48 cm (19 in) in d.b.h. as recorded in the American Forestry Association's register of champion trees. Heights on good sites of 9 to 12 in (30 to 40 ft) are common, with ranges in d.b.h. of 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in). On poorer sites, d.b.h. of mature trees may range from only 8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in). Near the northern limits of its range, dogwood is a many-branched shrub (15). Height growth in the southern Appalachians is reported to be fairly rapid for the first 20 to 30 years, but then it practically ceases. Individual plants may live for 125 years. Annual growth rings are usually 2 to 4 mm (0.06 to 0.15 in) wide (12). Flowering dogwood seldom if ever grows in pure stands. Thus, because it is usually a small, understory tree, little or no information is available concerning growth and yield on a per-acre basis. Moreover, it is treated as a weed tree in timber stand improvement operations more often than it is grown for its commercial value. One estimate has indicated that yields of 12.6 m³/ha of boltwood (2 cords/acre) may be cut on good sites, but it takes 15 to 20 times the area to obtain half this amount in other locations (15). No estimates of the volume of flowering dogwood are available for the entire range of the species. One writer noted that in six Southern States, where production is concentrated, a volume of 2.82 million m³ (99.8 million ft³) in trees 12.7 cm (5 in) d.b.h. and larger was shown by inventories made between 1962 and 1971 (12). This indicates a supply of more than 2.55 million m³ (1 million cords) within the six States. Rooting Habit- The extensive root system of flowering dogwood is extremely shallow. This fact undoubtedly accounts for the susceptibility of this species to periods of drought. Reaction to Competition- Flowering dogwood is an understory species and is classed as very tolerant of shade. Maximum photosynthesis occurs at slightly less than one-third of full sunlight (15). It is tolerant of high temperatures. Soil moisture usually is the limiting factor. In Southern forests, dogwood leaves are often the first to wilt in dry weather. Continuing drought may cause leaves to fall and dieback of tops to occur. Damaging Agents- Because of its thin bark, flowering dogwood is readily injured by fire. Its profuse sprouting ability may actually increase the number of stems in fire-damaged stands, however (12). Flooding also is detrimental to flowering dogwood. Little is known of the pest status of insects associated with wild flowering dogwoods, but many insects have been identified attacking cultivated ornamentals. The dogwood borer (Synanthedon scitula) is a noteworthy pest of cultivated flowering dogwood. Other damaging insects include flatheaded borers (Chrysobothris azurea and Agrilus cephalicus), dogwood twig borer (Oberea tripunctata), the twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata), scurfy scale (Chionaspis lintneri), and dogwood scale (C. corni) (1). Dogwood club gall, a clublike swelling on small twigs, is caused by infestations of midge larvae (Resseliella clavula) and is a serious problem in some areas (10). The redhumped caterpillar (Schizura concinna), a tussock moth (Dasychira basiflava), io moth (Automeris io), and scarab beetles (Phyllophaga spp.) are among the numerous leaf feeders attacking dogwood (1). Introduced pests of flowering dogwood include the Japanese weevil (Pseudocneorhinus bifasciatus) and Asiatic oak weevil (Crytepistomus castaneus) (8). Basal stem canker, caused by the fungus Phytophthora cactorum, may girdle the tree and is the most lethal disease. Target cankers (Nectria galligena) sometimes occur on the trunk and limbs, and Armillaria mellea has been found on dogwoods. Leafspot (Cercospora cornicola) attacks seedlings, and Meliodogyne incognita causes severe root galling, associated with dieback and premature leaf fall in seedlings. Twig blight, caused by the fungus Myxosporium nitidum, may cause dieback of small twigs. Leaf spots and dieback of flowers are caused by Botrytis cinerea, Elsinoe corni, and Septoria cornicola, while Ascochyta cornicola may result in shrivelling and blackening of the leaves (7). Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum) attacks dogwood (15), and the cherry leafroll, tobacco ringspot, and tomato ringspot viruses have been isolated from dogwood leaves (13). Noninfectious diseases include sunscald, mechanical and drought injury, and freezing. Dogwood reproduction is often browsed heavily by deer and rabbits.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,14,0
"The species grows on soils varying from deep and moist along minor streams to light textured and well drained in the uplands. It is found most frequently on soils with a pH of 6 to 7 (15). Dominant soil orders (with typical suborders in parentheses) in the range of flowering dogwood, in decreasing order of importance, include Ultisols (Udults and Aquults) in the South and East, Inceptisols (Ochrepts) in the Appalachians, Alfisols (Udalfs) in the Midwest, Spodosols (Orthods and Aquods) in New England and Florida, and Entisols (Psamments) in scattered areas of the Southeast (14). Seedling survival is low and the species is virtually absent on poorly drained clay soils. The frequency of flowering dogwood in forest stands increases as drainage improves and soils become lighter in texture. Flowering dogwood grows well on flats and on lower or middle slopes, but not very well on upper slopes and ridges. The inability to grow on extremely dry sites is attributed to its relatively shallow root system. It is one of the most numerous species in the understory of loblolly pine and loblolly pine-hardwood stands in the South. As these stands progress toward the hardwood climax, dogwood remains an important subordinate species. Flowering dogwood is considered a soil improver (7). Its leaf litter decomposes more rapidly than that of most other species, thus making its mineral constituents more readily available. Dogwood foliage decomposes three times faster than hickory (Carya spp.); four times faster than yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and white ash (Fraxinus americana); and 10 times faster than sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and oak (Quercus spp.) (15). In addition to its rapid decomposition, dogwood litter is an important source of calcium, containing 2.0 to 3.5 percent of this element on an oven-dry basis. The range of major mineral elements, in milligrams per kilogram of foliage (parts per million), is as follows: potassium, 4,000 to 11,000; phosphorus, 1,800 to 3,200; calcium, 27,000 to 42,000; magnesium, 3,000 to 5,000; and sulfur, 3,800 to 7,000. The range of minor elements, in mg/kg (p/m), is boron, 23; copper, 7 to 9; iron, 240 to 380; manganese, 30 to 50; and zinc, 3 to 28 (15). Dogwood leaves concentrate fluorine and may contain 40 mg/kg (p/m) compared to only 8 mg/kg (p/m) for apple (Malus spp.) and peach (Prunus spp.) leaves grown under similar conditions. In one study, fluorine increased from 72 mg/kg (p/m) in June to 103 mg/kg (p/m) in October, while that of black cherry (Prunus serotina) increased from 5.6 to 11.3 mg/kg (p/m) (15).",Soils and Topography,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,15,0
"Flowering dogwoods are extremely valuable for wildlife because the seed, fruit, flowers, twigs, bark, and leaves are utilized as food by various animals. The most distinguishing quality of dogwood is its high calcium and fat content (5). Fruits have been recorded as food eaten by at least 36 species of birds, including ruffed grouse, bob-white quail, and wild turkey. Chipmunks, foxes, skunks, rabbits, deer, beaver, black bears, and squirrels, in addition to other mammals, also eat dogwood fruits. Foliage and twigs are browsed heavily by deer and rabbits. The quality of browse may be improved by controlled burns in the spring, which increase the protein and phosphoric acid content. Flowering dogwood also is a favored ornamental species. It is highly regarded for landscaping and urban forestry purposes. Virtually all the dogwood harvested was used in the manufacture of shuttles for textile weaving, but plastic shuttles have rapidly replaced this use. Small amounts of dogwood are used for other articles requiring a hard, close-textured, smooth wood capable of withstanding rough use. Examples are spools, small pulleys, malletheads, jewelers' blocks, and turnpins for shaping the ends of lead pipes (12).",Special Uses,Flowering Dogwood,cornus,florida,hardwood,16,0
"Fraser fir is a component of four forest cover types (10): Pin Cherry (Society of American Foresters Type 17), Red Spruce-Yellow Birch (Type 30), Red Spruce (Type 32), and Red Spruce-Fraser Fir (Type 34). It is a minor stand component at the lower elevations, increasing in frequency with altitude to form nearly pure stands at elevations above 1920 m (6,300 ft). At the highest elevation, mountain-ash (Sorbus americana) is practically the only canopy associate (32). At middle and lower elevations, red spruce (Picea rubens), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) are the most common canopy associates (6,7,8,13,16,32).

"Fraser fir was once considered a variety of balsam fir and designated Abies balsamea var. fraseri Nutt., but the two species are now differentiated on the basis of cone-bract and cone-scale length. Abies balsamea has bracts shorter or rarely slightly longer than its scales; A. fraseri has strongly reflexed bracts much longer than its scales (20). Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis in West Virginia and northern Virginia is considered by some to be a natural hybrid of A. balsamea and A. fraseri because it is intermediate in range and the two have certain common characteristics. Others contend that the disjunct Abies subpopulations of the southern Appalachians are relicts of a once-continuous ancestral fir population with clinal variation along a north-south gradient (22,25,30,33). Artificial crosses of Abies balsamea x A. fraseri have been made successfully. A cultivar, A. fraseri cv. prostrata, is a dwarf shrub with horizontally spreading branches used for ornamental purposes (18).",Genetics,Fraser Fir,abies,fraseri,conifer,7,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- Fraser fir is monoecious. Flower buds usually open from mid-May to early June. Female flowers are borne mostly in the top few feet of the crown and on the outer ends of branches. Male flowers are borne below female flowers, but mostly in the top half of the crown. The fruit is an erect cone, 3.5 to 6 cm (1.4 to 2.4 in) long and 2.5 to 4 cm (1.0 to 1.6 in) wide. The strongly reflexed bracts, much longer than the scales, distinguish Fraser fir from balsam fir. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production may begin when trees are 15 years old. Good seed crops occur every other year with light crops in the intervening year. The number of seeds ranges from 119,000 to 174,000/kg (54,000 to 79,000/lb) and averages 134,500 (61,000). The combination of lightweight winged seeds, steep slopes, and high winds makes for good seed dispersal. Seeds may be moved as much as 1.6 km (1 mi), with 50 percent falling over 274 m (900 ft) from their source. Fruit ripens and is dispersed from September through mid-October. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. It approximates 50 percent of sound seeds and appears to be correlated with length of the maturation period. Germination of seeds collected on August 31 was 18 percent but increased to 66 percent for seeds gathered during cone disintegration about September 23 (26). During poor seed years, the yield and quality of seed decrease and insect damage increases (27,28). In a good year, seeds averaged 78 percent filled, with only 3 percent infested by insects. In a poor year, only 36 Percent were filled, and 29 percent of that were infested by a seed chalcid, Megastigmus specularis. Fraser fir seeds germinate well on mineral soil, moss, peat, decaying stumps and logs, and even on litter that is sufficiently moist. When seeds germinate on surface litter, the seedlings usually die during dry weather. Moss and peat commonly remain damp, however, and the appearance of moss on the forest floor indicates sufficient moisture to make germination possible with survival throughout the growing season (19). Stratification of Fraser fir seeds may not be wholly necessary. Stratification for 60 days in peat moss at 3° C (38° F) increased the speed of germination but did not affect the number of seeds germinating. Germination and initial establishment are best under a forest cover. The greatest obstacle to natural reforestation is the desiccation of the moss and peat layer after cutting or fire, followed by surface drying of the mineral soil. Once established, growth is best in full light. Under a dense canopy, Fraser fir may be only 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) tall in 20 years. In old-growth, all-aged stands, it may take 40 years to attain sapling size. In the absence of shade, it grows much faster. Planted seedlings in cutover forest averaged 2.5 m (8.2 ft) tall in 11 years, with 0.6 m (2 ft) of growth in the 11th year. Under favorable conditions of weed control and fertilization, Christmas tree plantings grow to 1.8 m (6 ft) in 6 to 8 years. Vegetative Reproduction- Under natural conditions, layering may occur when lower branches come in contact with moist soil, but it is not an important reproductive mechanism. Fraser fir planting stock may be produced by rooting cuttings under controlled temperatures and moisture. A high percentage of stem cuttings from young trees can be induced to root. In one study, rooting was 92 percent in cuttings from 5-year-old trees, compared with 54 percent from 12-year-olds and 29 percent from 22-year-olds. Rooting of cuttings from 32- to 65-year-old trees averaged 4 to 6 percent and varied with crown position (15). It is possible to propagate Fraser fir by stump culture (32). When a Christmas tree is cut, the bottom whorl of limbs is left on the stump. After these turn upward, the most vigorous limb is allowed to develop into another tree.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Fraser Fir,abies,fraseri,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Fraser fir is a relatively small tree, rarely more than 24 m (80 ft) tall and 61 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. It is more frequently 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft) tall and less than 30 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. Age at natural death is around 150 years (23). Old-growth stands of mixed spruce-fir may carry very high basal areas of 57 to 60 m²/ha (250 to 260 ft²/acre) with 1,977 to 2,347 trees/ha (800 to 950/acre) 2.5 cm (1.0 in) in d.b.h. and larger (7). In such stands the fir may average 25 to 28 cm (10 to 11 in) in d.b.h. Yields of mixed spruce-fir over large acreages have been reported to average 210 to 350 m³/ha (15,000 to 25,000 fbm/acre), some stands yielding 560 to 700 m³/ha (40,000 to 50,000 fbm/acre) (24). Pulpwood yields averaged 252 to 315 m³/ha (40 to 50 cords/acre). In such stands, fir constituted one-fourth or less of the total volume. At the highest elevations where fir forms essentially pure stands, it is most frequently 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) tall, and most canopy stems are 18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 in) in d.b.h. Stems as large as 31 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. are very rare in such stands (31). Rooting Habit- The root system of Fraser fir is usually shallow because it customarily occupies shallow soils. Root growth is more rapid and rooting depth greater, however, than that of its frequent associate, red spruce (8). Roots are able to penetrate to depths greater than 61 cm (24 in) where soil is available, permitting fir to occupy somewhat drier sites than red spruce (7). Reaction to Competition- Fraser fir is classified as very tolerant to shade and is considered a climax species. It becomes established and survives for many years under a dense canopy, growing only 2.5 to 5.1 cm (1 to 2 in) per year. When released, it has a marked capacity for recovery. Trees suppressed for 50 years or more have grown rapidly for a time after release (23). Fraser fir tends to form very dense stands which thin slowly and may stagnate in the pole stage (7). The best means of regenerating fir is probably some method of partial cutting to establish advance reproduction. Harvest methods such as shelterwood or group selection seem ideally suited to accommodate its needs for early shelter but open conditions for later growth. Because of its extreme tolerance, it could probably be handled under a single-tree selection system as well. Damaging Agents- Because of shallow soils and shallow root systems, Fraser fir is subject to windfall (7). Patches of windthrown trees are a common sight on exposed ridges. Occasional trees on higher ridges are struck by lightning. Heart rots are common in older trees and may increase susceptibility to wind damage. In Christmas tree plantations, two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) can be particularly damaging, causing discoloration and needle loss. On soils with poor internal drainage, root rot caused by the fungus Phytophthora spp. becomes a major problem. All damaging agents are insignificant in comparison to the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae). It was discovered in North Carolina in 1957 on Mount Mitchell and has since spread to all areas of Fraser fir (1,2,3,4,9,17,18). Mortality progressed rapidly from 11,000 trees in 1958 to about 1.75 million by 1970. Fir mortality has been extensive in all areas except Mount Rogers in Virginia, where infestations dating back to the mid-1960's were first discovered in 1979. Adelgids attack branches, twigs, nodes, and bud bases of fir, but stem attack is the predominant form of infestation. Death usually follows 2 to 5 years after infestation of the bole because of direct translocation impairment. Further damage by other organisms is associated with attack by the balsam woolly adelgid (11, 12). Weakened trees are often attacked by bark beetles, wood wasps, and other wood-boring insects, which also may introduce fungal pathogens (12). Incidence of root rot caused by Armillaria mellea was shown to increase with increasing severity of adelgid damage. Damaged and weakened trees are also more susceptible to windthrow and top breakage. Various chemical insecticides have been found effective against the balsam woolly adelgid, but none has been found technically or economically feasible for use over large forested areas (14). Chemical insecticides are useful, however, for small and accessible stands of high value. Control by a variety of introduced predators has been ineffective. Openings created by adelgid kill usually contain numerous fir seedlings (5), but the long-term consequences of adelgid attack are unknown. Unless new methods of adelgid control are found, the status of Fraser fir in natural stands is extremely uncertain.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Fraser Fir,abies,fraseri,conifer,14,1
"There is considerable variation in color, depth, and organic matter content in the soils that support Fraser fir. A typical profile has well-developed organic and A1 horizons and a B horizon differentiated by color but not by accumulations of clay or iron. Soils are shallow and rocky, with bedrock within 50 to 80 cm (20 to 32 in) of the mineral soils surface (23). The upper 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) of the mineral soil are typically black and greasy, underlaid by a leached gray or yellowish-brown sandy subsoil. Organic surface layers are occasionally thick but usually quite thin, ranging from 2 to 7 cm (0.8 to 2.8 in). The soils are extremely acid; the A horizon pH is about 3.5 and the B horizon pH 3.8 to 4.2. Soil under fir stands above 1920 m (6,300 ft) may be very shallow, with only 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) of a black A horizon lying directly on bedrock (7). Most soils on which Fraser fir grows are Inceptisols. Fraser fir grows at elevations as low as 1372 m (4,500 ft) on north slopes and protected coves but is found mostly above 1676 m (5,500 ft). It grows at 2037 m (6,684 ft) on top of Mount Mitchell, the highest point in eastern North America.",Soils and Topography,Fraser Fir,abies,fraseri,conifer,15,1
"The remaining stands of Fraser fir have very limited commercial value. However, their location in the cool climate of the loftiest peaks and ridges makes them extremely valuable for watershed protection, as they hold the shallow soil to the steep wet slopes. They are also a unique scenic attraction in a region of growing recreational appeal. Growing and harvesting this species for Christmas trees and boughs is a multimillion-dollar business in the southern Appalachians. Because of its thick green foliage, beautiful shape, fragrance, and needles that are retained unusually well, Fraser fir is unequaled as a Christmas tree (29,32). It is also used widely as an ornamental yard tree. Fraser fir seeds and terminal buds are eaten extensively by the red squirrel.",Special Uses,Fraser Fir,abies,fraseri,conifer,16,1
"Fraser magnolia is a moderately frequent tree species in a number of forest types; however, its relative density is generally less than 10 percent, regardless of its size or location (3,7,8). For example, it constitutes only 0.3 percent of all trees on the Jefferson National Forest in western Virginia. At elevations greater than 1200 m (3,940 ft) associated species include mountain maple (Acer spicatum), striped maple (A. pensyluanicum), and sugar maple, American beech, American basswood (Tilia americana), Carolina basswood, yellow buckeye, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), and eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) (2,3,4,6,8). Elsewhere, commonly associated species are: sweet birch (Betula lenta), hickories (Carya spp.), American chestnut (Castanea dentata) (as sprouts), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), white ash (Fraxinus americana), Carolina silverbell (Halesia carolina), American holly (Ilex opaca), butternut (Juglans cinerea), black walnut (J. nigra), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), cucumbertree (Magnolia acuminata), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), black cherry (Prunus serotina), white, scarlet, chestnut, and northern red oaks (Quercus alba, Q. coccinea, Q. prinus, and Q. rubra, respectively), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), white basswood (Tilia heterophylla), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) (14,15). Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), pitch pine (P. rigida), Table Mountain pine (P. pungens), and shortleaf pine (P echinata) are occasional associates.",Associated Forest Cover,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,1,0
"Within the natural range of Fraser magnolia during the growing season, average rainfall varies considerably. In West Virginia, April to September rainfall averages 610 to 760 mm (24 to 30 in), but in north Georgia and western North Carolina, it averages 910 to 990 mm (36 to 39 in) (17). Total annual precipitation in West Virginia varies from 1020 to 1270 mm (40 to 50 in), while in the southern Appalachians, the variation is between 1020 and 2030 mm (40 to 80 in). July temperatures average 21° to 24° C (70° to 75° F) and January temperatures range from -1 to 2° C (30° to 35° F) where Fraser magnolia occurs in West Virginia and Virginia, and from 2° to 4° C (35° to 40° F) in the southern end of the Appalachians. The frost-free period varies from 150 to 170 days in West Virginia and Virginia, and from 170 to 180 days in the southern Appalachians of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina.",Climate,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,2,0
"Certain distribution patterns are affected by polyploidy. Among magnolias, the relatively sharply peaked and restricted diploids, Fraser magnolia and umbrella magnolia, may be compared with the tetraploid cucumbertree (21). Supposedly, a diploid species with extensive ecotypic variation should have a wider range than a polyploid derived from it; how ever, cucumbertree has the widest range of all three species. No races or hybrids of Fraser magnolia have been reported, but a variety, Magnolia fraseri var. pyramidata (Bartr.) Pampanini, is occasionally mentioned (13).",Genetics,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,7,0
"Restricted mostly to the Appalachians, Fraser magnolia is found in moist habitats in the mountains of West Virginia, generally in the eastern half of the State, in western Virginia, in the southern Appalachians of east Tennessee and western North Carolina, and in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwestern South Carolina and northeast Georgia (12,13). It also grows in the Cumberland Mountains of southeastern Kentucky. -The native range of Fraser magnolia.",Native Range,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,11,0
"Any forest activity that increases the amount of incident light striking the forest floor and exposes mineral soil is conducive to the establishment of Fraser magnolia regeneration on mesic sites that have seed-bearing trees of the species. Flowering and Fruiting- Fraser magnolia has perfect flowers. The blossoms open from May to June depending on latitude, elevation, and weather conditions. The solitary flowers are about 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in) wide; they consist of six to nine obovatespatulate petals conspicuously constricted below the middle (9,16). The fruit is an oblong, conelike aggregate of fleshy one- or two-seeded follicles, that ripen in late summer to early fall. At maturity, the red, drupelike seeds are about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long. Seed Production and Dissemination- A good seed crop occurs only every 4 to 5 years. Cleaned seeds range from 5,470 to 12,460/kg (2,480 to 5,650/lb), averaging 10,030/kg (4,550/lb) (14,18). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Stratified seeds placed in a sandy medium and kept at day and night temperatures of 30° C (86° F) and 20° C (68° F), respectively, from 40 to 100 days, have a germinative capacity of 8 to 21 percent-low in comparison to other magnolias (18). In spite of low germinative capacity, Fraser magnolia is one of the tree species that colonizes canopy gaps caused by the fall of single, large eastern hemlocks in the Great Smoky Mountains (2). It is also common as volunteer regeneration along logging roads in the southern Appalachians and is found frequently as seedlings and saplings in small openings on mesic sites near seedbearing trees. Foliage begins expanding the last week in April. Radial growth initiates in middle to late May and continues until the second week of August; at times it may last until the first week of September (14). Seedling reproduction is regarded as slow growing over most of its range when it is under closed or even partial canopies; however, Fraser magnolia seedlings even in clearcuts quickly fall behind other fast-growing intolerant species such as yellow-poplar, black cherry, and sweet birch. Vegetative Reproduction- Although Fraser magnolia seedlings have difficulty in surviving to even an intermediate canopy position, stump sprouts survive more easily. It is highly possible that many, if not most, of the larger Fraser magnolia trees in the Appalachian forest region are of stump sprout origin; possibly many are seedling sprouts (7). In this growth habit, the species closely resembles yellowpoplar and northern red oak. Seemingly, clearcutting with resultant sprout growth is the best way of reproducing Fraser magnolia.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- On most mesic sites, where Fraser magnolia does best, its sprouts grow vigorously from sapling to pole stage. In a Blue Ridge gorge, it was the last tree to begin growth in spring 1965 and 1966, but it grew very rapidly until growth cessation in late August (14). Peak growth occurred at or below midslope. Average circumferential 3-year growth measured by band dendrometer at d.b.h. was 1.08 cm (0.424 in). On the flat, moist bottom land between slopes, Fraser magnolia trees were even-aged, about 50 years old, and formed part of a closed canopy. In an intensive cleaning study established in spring 1960 in an 11-year-old mixed hardwood sapling stand near the Pink Beds on Pisgah National Forest, NC (5), 14-year diameter growth of the four largest trees on one 0.01-ha (0.025-acre) plot was measured. Site quality was 28.7 m (94 ft) for yellowpoplar; there were 2,076 trees per hectare (840/acre) and 3.44 m²/ha (15 ft²/acre) of basal area after cleaning. Results were as follows: The 14-year increase in diameter for Fraser magnolia was 13.0 cm (5.1 in); for yellow-poplar, 20.8 cm (8.2 in); for northern red oak, 10.9 cm (4.3 in); and for sweet birch, 11.4 cm (4.5 in) (19). Although at age 11 Fraser magnolia was larger than yellow-poplar by 3.3 cm (1.3 in), by age 21 yellow-poplar had exceeded it in size and was 4.6 cm (1.8 in) larger at age 25. At that time the plot contained 22.96 m² /ha (100 ft² /acre) of basal area and the stand was reduced to 1,483 trees/ha (600 trees/acre). This example serves to illustrate that Fraser magnolia sprout growth can be rapid in the early years of an even-aged stand. By maturity, however, Fraser magnolia is an intermediate tree in relation to the stand canopy. In this regard, growth of Fraser magnolia resembles that of Carolina basswood and cucumbertree; all three generally grow slower than yellow-poplar. Fraser magnolia needs sunlight for growth and survival. This is shown by its generally contorted bole and branches, which result from growing leaders constantly twisting to exploit light from small openings. Occasionally a forest-grown Fraser magnolia can become as large as 61 cm (24 in) d.b.h. and 24 m (80 ft) tall (7). The largest tree on record, growing in Philadelphia, PA, has a d.b.h. of 81 cm (32 in), a total height of 20 m (65 ft), and a crown spread of 15 m (50 ft). No Fraser magnolia grows in the mountain counties of Virginia northeast of Roanoke Gap. The greatest volume is found in western Virginia, followed by North Carolina. Lesser volumes are found in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, but specific data are not available (11). Stand and stocking data for Fraser magnolia in the Southeastern States are shown in table 1. Pulpwood-size trees through the 25.4 cm (10 in) diameter class account for 81 percent of the cubic-foot volume and 91 percent of the trees. The largest trees fall only into the 40.6 cm (16 in) diameter class and constitute less than 1 percent of all trees but 19 percent of total board-foot volume. Yields per acre are unavailable because of the sporadic occurrence and low density of Fraser magnolia. Rooting Habit- Fraser magnolia seedlings have a deeply penetrating taproot. By the time seedlings become saplings, lateral roots are well developed (7). Because of generally loose, friable soils, the root configuration of the trees remains unchanged through maturity except that roots grow larger. Reaction to Competition- Fraser magnolia responds best to some form of even-age management. It is classed as being intermediate in tolerance to shade. Clearcutting is one way to regenerate it. At best, however, Fraser magnolia is likely to constitute less than 10 percent of any stand (3,8). Since most of the regeneration is of sprout origin (7,14), it is highly dependent on the availability and distribution of Fraser magnolia trees in the original stand. Any additional trees that develop are likely to be seedling sprouts from damaged prelogging seedlings. Since many seedlings are found in mature stands, a one or two-cut shelterwood would help seedlings grow t( sapling size before the final harvest cut, and in this way they would have a competitive advantage over faster growing, more intolerant species. Because Fraser magnolia grows in clumps, early release by precommercial thinning to one stem accelerates its diameter growth and improves its form. Although Fraser magnolia can compete well on most sites with associated tree species for the first 40 or 50 years, at best it is short-lived and is prone to drop out of stands when it is 60 to 70 years old. When intermediate thinnings are part of stand management, as opposed to custodial management, Fraser magnolia is very often one of the first trees to be cut because of its generally poor form and susceptibility to damage. There is little incentive to manage it in the hope of producing high-quality timber. Damaging Agents- Because of its thin bark, Fraser magnolia is very susceptible to fire and to logging damage (7); both can lead to various wood rots. Nectria magnoliae causes cankers on small or suppressed Fraser magnolia trees (10). Whenever such trees become dominant or crown free, the cankers often heal. Fungi capable of causing rot of the central cylinder or in wounds are Ganoderma applanatum, Fomes geotropus, Daedalea ambigua, Polyporus calkinsii, P curtisii, and Laetiporus sulphureus. White heartrot in living trees is caused by Fomes sclerodermeus. Sprout leaves may be heavily attacked by common powdery mildew, Phyllactinia guttata. Phyllosticta magnoliae causes a large black leaf spot. Phoma pedunculi and Cytospora tumulosa occur on branches. Fraser magnolia probably cannot withstand prolonged inundation, as evidenced by the cool, moist, but well-drained sites where it generally grows. Several insect species can damage, if not kill, Fraser magnolia. Euzophera ostricolorella attacks the base of mature trees and E. magnolialis kills seedlings (1). The ambrosia beetle, Platypus compositus, makes tunnels and larval cradles in the wood. Xyloterinus politus breeds in injured, dying, and recently cut trees, severely degrading lumber of infested wood because of adult tunneling. Larvae of the June beetle, Phyllophaga forsteri, feed on roots, and adults feed on foliage. Magnolia scale, Neolecanium cornuparuum feeds on current-year twig growth, seriously weakening and sometimes killing host trees.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,14,0
"Fraser magnolia is generally found on mesic sites, but seedlings and saplings have been reported to occur on subxeric and even on xeric sites (4,8,14,15,21). In the gorges of the southern Blue Ridge Front, it is more frequently found below midslope, being most common on the lowest third of north and south slopes, and on the bottom land. In the gorge region it has an unusual habit of growing in a multiple- stemmed group on bottoms and as a single-stemmed tree on slopes; elsewhere it occurs in either form. Sites on which it grows best are generally protected, moist, and fertile; soil temperatures on such sites are generally cool during the growing season in comparison with sites farther upslope. On lower slopes and in the bottom of the Long Spur River Gorge in the southeastern escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains between Rosman and Highlands, NC, average chemical contents and other properties of the 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) soil layer of the Tusquitee loam (an Umbric Dystrochrept of the order Inceptisols) supporting Fraser magnolia were as follows: sodium, 0.9 meq/100 g; potassium, 0.20 meq/100 g; calcium, 0. 10 meq/100 g; and magnesium, 0.11 meq/100 g; nitrous nitrogen, 1.6 p/m; phosphorus, 2.0 p/m; and iron, 1.9 p/m; pH 4.8; and organic matter, 6.6 percent (14,20). The nutrient status of this soil is low because plentiful soil moisture makes nutrients quickly available to all plants, and the nutrients are thus tied up until the plants are recycled. In the Great Craggy Mountains above Dillingham, NC, at an elevation of 1200 m (3,940 ft) where the northwest slope averages 40 percent, the following average soil values prevail in a stand composed mostly of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), and Carolina basswood (Tilia caroliniana), and some Fraser magnolia: pH 4.8, organic matter 7 percent, bulk density 0.96 g/cm³ (59.9 lb/ft³ ). The top 15 cm (6 in) of mineral soil contained phosphatephosphorus 1.7 kg/ha (1.5 lb/acre), potassium 118 kg/ha (105 lb/acre), calcium 936 kg/ha (835 lb/acre) and magnesium 108 kg/ha (96 lb/acre) (6). The soils are mostly Edneyville stony loam which is a mesic Typic Hapludult of the order Ultisols (20): parent materials are Precambrian acid crystalline rocks, including gneisses, schists, granite, diorite, and some mica-gneisses and mica-schists. Farther northeast, near Grandfather Mountain (1956 m or 6,417 ft) in the Blue Ridge Front, Fraser magnolia grows on Ashe soil, a Typic Dystrochrept derived from Cranberry granite at an elevation of about 1200 m (3,940 ft). The terrain slopes steeply to the southeast, and the soils are deep, coarse, conspicuously gray-white sandy loams or loams which are very well drained. Rainfall is well distributed and plentiful throughout the year so soil moisture is ample and not restrictive to forest growth. On the Jefferson National Forest in western Virginia, Fraser magnolia is found mostly on soils developed from sandstone or shale. In the Appalachian Plateau of West Virginia, it grows on rich, moist, colluvial soils derived from upper-Devonian and Pennsylvanian rock formations (3,7). Fraser magnolia generally grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 1700 m (1,640 to 5,580 ft) but is most common from about 600 to 1300 m (1,970 to 4,270 ft).",Soils and Topography,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,15,0
"In the lumber trade, Fraser magnolia is included with yellow-poplar sawtimber and pulpwood (7). It has little value as firewood and generally has little value as sawtimber because of sweep and crook. Wildlife use larger defective trees of Fraser magnolia as den trees. Sprouts are browsed. In a mountainous area of western North Carolina, where Fraser magnolia sprouts occurred with a frequency of 20 percent and a density of 717 stems per hectare (290/acre), the species was 37-percent utilized by white-tailed deer (5). Frequent use is made of Fraser magnolia as an ornamental (16).",Special Uses,Fraser Magnolia,magnolia,fraseri,hardwood,16,0
"If much of the earlier discussion seemed to deal with two or perhaps three species, it may be because the taxonomy of the genus is poorly understood. Only 2 of about 150 species of Castanopsis are found in North America. These two are distinct from their Asian relatives, and systematists have created a new genus for them, Chrysolepis (4,10). The American species have a floral morphology that is intermediate to Castanopsis and Lithocarpus, and it represents the ancient condition of the family Fagaceae. The new scientific names for the American species, with the older names in parentheses, are Chrysolepis chrysophylla (Dougl.) Hjelmqvist (Castanopsis chrysophylla (Dougl.) A. DC.) for giant chinkapin and Chrysolepis sempervirens (Kell.) Hjelmqvist (Castanopsis sempervirens Dudl.) for evergreen chinkapin. The uniqueness of the two species at the genus level does not imply a simple relationship between them. The ranges of the shrub form of giant chinkapin and of evergreen chinkapin overlap from northern coastal California into the Cascade Range of Oregon. The two species probably hybridize where they coexist (8). An apparently continuous intergradation of characters can be found in the Cascades in southern Oregon and in the Siskiyou Mountains. The two growth forms of giant chinkapin are probably not the result of plastic phenotypic response to site conditions, although they may be in portions of the species range. In the northern Coast Ranges of California, the tree form occupies relatively moist conditions; the shrub form grows on dry, sterile ridgetops in chapparal communities. In the central part of the Cascades of Oregon, the pattern is reversed-the tree form is found primarily in relatively open and dry ridgetop forest communities, and the shrub form is spread through the more mesic forest stands. Only the shrub form is found at high elevations in the Cascade Range. This variation is due to the probable existence of at least three ecotypes of giant chinkapin: a dry-site chaparral shrub ecotype of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California that probably matches the taxonomic category of Castanopsis chrysophylla var. minor Benth; a high-elevation ecotype adapted to heavy snowpack, cool temperatures, and short growing seasons found along the Oregon Cascades and in eastern Oregon; and a tree form that occurs in forest stands at lower elevations. The latter ecotype seems well adapted to dry, relatively infertile sites but can and does do well in more mesic conditions that have a history of disturbance by fire.",Genetics,Giant Chinkapin,castanopsis,chrysophylla,hardwood,7,0
"The natural range of giant chinkapin extends from San Luis Obispo County in California to Mason County in west-central Washington (14). In California, it grows primarily in the Coast Ranges, with a disjunct population in the Sierra Nevada in El Dorado County (8). In Oregon, it is found in the Coast Ranges as far north as Benton County, and throughout the Cascade Range. Giant chinkapin is represented in Washington by two disjunct populations in Mason and Skamania Counties (13). Shrub forms of the species are found throughout its range. The tree form is primarily distributed from Lane County, OR, south to Marin County, CA. It is found from near sea level in the Coast Ranges of Oregon and California to over 1525 m (5,000 ft) in elevation in the Cascades. Although giant chinkapin is generally thought of as a mid- to low-elevation species, the shrub form can be found along the crest of the Cascade Range in Oregon from 1525 to 1830 m (5,000 to 6,000 ft) (5). -The native range of giant chinkapin. The generally mild climate over the range of giant chinkapin is characterized by winter precipitation and summer drought. Rainfall ranges from an annual mean of less than 510 mm (20 in) in southern California to more than 3300 mm (130 in) in the Cascades in Oregon. Much of the winter precipitation in the higher elevations of the Cascades occurs as snow. Little rain falls from June to September, and the duration and intensity of drought increase in the southern portion of the range, which has a Mediterranean climate. The tree form of the species occurs in the warm but relatively moist portion of the climatic conditions within which it grows. Although the shrubby form is found throughout the species range, it achieves greatest coverage in the more extreme climates of xeric sites and higher elevations. Giant chinkapin is found in a wide variety of topographic positions, from valley bottom to ridgetop, and on a wide range of soils. It achieves the highest cover in the northern portion of its range on Inseptisols and Entisols. In the southern portion of its range, highest cover is found on Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols. A partial list of parent materials includes basaltic, dioritic, sedimentary, metasedimentary, and serpentinaceous types. Giant chinkapin is ubiquitous in some portions of its range, such as the central part of the Cascades in Oregon, where it is a minor shrubby component of many forest stands on a range of soils. It achieves maximum size and cover, however, on sites that have relatively deep soils that apparently are deficient in nutrients (17). In other portions of its range, giant chinkapin may be quite restricted, or its different growth forms may be found in markedly contrasting topographic and soil conditions. Nowhere is the latter more evident than in the Siskiyou and Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon and north coastal California, where the shrub form achieves greatest cover on dry, sterile, rocky ridgetops and southerly facing slopes in chaparral associations. The tree form is found on northerly aspects on benches and broad ridges with deep soils and more moderate moisture stresses (12). Over much of the range of giant chinkapin, a general pattern emerges of a species that is at its competitive best on sites that are relatively infertile and droughty. Pure stands of giant chinkapin are uncommon and rarely exceed 10 ha (25 acres). The species is a minor component in a wide range of forest communities and in its shrub form is a component of chaparral communities. Common tree associates in the Cascade Range are Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), white fir (Abies concolor), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), and Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis). In southwestern Oregon, Douglas-fir, western white pine (Pinus monticola), incense-cedar, sugar pine, Pacific madrone, and ponderosa pine continue to be associates, with the additional species: tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), California black oak (Quercus kelloggii), knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata), Port-Orford- cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis). Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is added to the list in north coastal California. As a result of the wide ecological amplitude of both shrub and tree forms, giant chinkapin is found in many Society of American Foresters forest cover types (3). It is most important in terms of size and cover in certain communities in the following types: Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock (Type 230); Port Orford-Cedar (Type 231); Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243), and Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244). Common shrub species found in association with giant chinkapin in the Cascades in central Oregon are Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), salal (Gaultheria shallon), Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), and baldhip rose (Rosa gymnocarpa). Shrub associates in the Cascades in southern Oregon include: California dewberry (Rubus ursinus), baldhip rose, common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), salal, and ocean-spray (Holodiscus discolor). In southwestern Oregon, common shrub associates are: canyon live oak, huckleberry oak Quercus vaccinifolia), poison-oak (Rhus diversiloba), Oregongrape, baldhip rose, California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica), California dewberry, and a number of manzanita (Arctostaphylos) species. Low shrub and herb species that are common associates include: modest whipplea (Whipplea modesta), common prince's-pine (Chimaphila umbellata), American twinflower (Linnaea borealis), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and common beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax).",Habitat,Giant Chinkapin,castanopsis,chrysophylla,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Giant chinkapin is monoecious, with unisexual staminate and pistillate flowers on the same plant. The staminate flowers form dense catkins 2.5 to 7.6 cm (1 to 3 in) long. One to three pistillate flowers are borne within an involucre at the base of the staminate catkin or separately along the stem. Pollination is adapted to wind, but bees frequent the flowers and probably aid in pollination, much to the dismay of beekeepers, for it imparts a bad taste to the honey in a mast year. The fruit matures in the fall of the second growing season and contains one to three hard-shelled nuts within a very spiny golden brown bur 15 to 25 mm (0.6 to 1.0 in) broad, colloquially referred to as ""porkypine eggs."" The nuts are relatively large1,800 to 2,400/kg (830 to 1,100/lb) (11). The phenology of flowering, fruit ripening, and seed dispersal varies widely over the range of giant chinkapin: flowering (February to July), fruit ripening (August to October), seed dispersal (fall). Three years of phenological records at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon show local phenology to be less varied: flowering (mid-June to mid-July), fruit ripening (mid-August to early September), and seed dispersal (peaking in late September, but prolonged into early December). Seed Production and Dissemination- Vigorously growing giant chinkapin produce some seed every year with mast years occurring at 2- to 5-year intervals. Understory shrubs of the species flower infrequently. Sound seeds are produced by vigorous trees, apparently of seed origin, that are 40 to 50 years old, but the age of the first seed production is probably much less. Six-year-old stump sprouts have produced some sound seeds. The production of sound seeds can be greatly reduced locally by insects. In a sample of seeds at three locations in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, two sites had less than 15 percent of the seeds infested, but at the third site nearly 100 percent of the seeds had been attacked by insects. The primary agents of dissemination of giant chinkapin seed are gravity, squirrels, and birds, not necessarily in that order of importance. Vertebrates are undoubtedly important vectors. Several species of birds feed on nuts, and clumps of young seedlings not originating from sprouts implicate squirrels in caching food. Seedling Development- Reported germination ranges from 14 to 53 percent (11); one study found it to have the poorest rate of germination of all hardwoods in the Klamath Province of southwestern Oregon and northern California (15). Germination is hypogeal and takes place in 16 to 24 days. Although the rate of germination was not increased by cold stratification, which suggested that germination and establishment in the fall are possible, no such germination was observed during 3 years of study at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest. Natural seedlings of giant chinkapin which ranged from 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in) in height were found only in relatively open stand conditions in the Experimental Forest. The individuals appeared to have germinated under a light leaf mulch in partial shade. The tallest was 12 years old and the shortest 4, but the height-age relationship was poor. In the northern Coast Ranges of California, the best seedling establishment occurs on mesic sites without dense layers of understory vegetation (12). Vegetative Reproduction- Giant chinkapin sprouts prolifically when cut or injured. Light understory fires cause vigorous basal sprouting. Even intense broadcast burns will not prevent basal sprouts from rapidly regrowing. Height growth of the sprouts can be rapid, outstripping young conifer growth for several years. Because of its aggressive sprouting ability, giant chinkapin is a problem for forest management on many sites. The species is well adapted to a regime of frequent fires, which is reflected in the chaparral shrub form. Also, over much of the northern portion of the range of giant chinkapin, the tree form occupies ridgetop positions with other fire-adapted species. Its ability to exist with the potentially taller conifers may be the result of both its sprouting ability and relatively high fire frequency. Growth and Yield- Giant chinkapin is rarely a dominant species in a stand, and it is often an understory shrub or small tree of poor form. Growth and yield data are therefore nearly nonexistent for giant chinkapin despite its ability to develop a bole of good form and height in dense stands on optimum sites. The following information was obtained from unpublished data of the USDA Forest Service and Oregon State University. Giant chinkapin provided 11 percent of the total stemwood volume of about 700 m³/ha (50,000 fbm/acre) in an 80-year-old stand in the Coast Ranges of Oregon; the stand was site III for Douglas-fir. The mean diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of stems greater than 15 cm (6 in) for giant chinkapin was 34 cm (13.4 in). The largest giant chinkapin in the stand were codominants about 27 in (90 ft) tall. In two stands about 100 years old in the Cascades of Oregon, giant chinkapin made up 11 and 21 percent of the total stemwood volume. The two sites were site III and IV for Douglas-fir and had estimated volumes of about 800 and 550 m³ /ha (57,100 and 39,300 fbm/acre). In the site III stand, giant chinkapin stems greater than 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. averaged 20 cm (7.8 in) in d.b.h. Their mean diameter increment for the previous 10-year period was 1.8 mm. (0.07 in) per year. The average d.b.h. of giant chinkapin stems greater than 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. in the second stand on the poorer site was larger-30 cm (11.8 in). The mean annual diameter increment for the previous 10-year period was also slightly larger-2 mm (0.08 in) per year. Because of the species' ability to resprout, individual genets of giant chinkapin could be several centuries old. The species is susceptible to heart-rotting fungi, which makes aging of large, old trees difficult. At the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon, the maximum age was found to range from 130 to 150 years. In the northern Coast Ranges of California maximum ages were estimated to range between 400 and 500 years, with the oldest trees on the more xeric habitats (12). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- The competitive ability of giant chinkapin appears to be improved relative to its associates on nutritionally poor sites with high moisture stress. The shrub form is quite tolerant of shade. The tree form is less tolerant of shade and is probably most accurately classified as intermediate in tolerance, comparable to incensecedar or sugar pine with which it is often found. Chinkapin does not attain the height of many of its associates, is often overtopped in mature stands of conifers, and declines in importance during later stages of succession. Over much of its range, some disturbance-such as fire, logging, or windstorm-is required for giant chinkapin to remain an important component of the forest on most sites. Under relatively droughty, infertile conditions, it can be a very aggressive and undesirable species during early succession. This is the aspect of giant chinkapin that is perhaps best known by foresters. Considerably more research has been conducted on how to rid sites of giant chinkapin than on how to promote its establishment and growth. The most effective site preparation methods for controlling giant chinkapin have been scarification by tractor or spraying and burning. Neither slash burning nor hand scalping is effective, and herbicides produce only moderate results (1,2,7). Because giant chinkapin is usually found mixed with other undesirable species, broad-spectrum herbicides, such as 2,4-D and triclopyr ester, have been used most frequently (1,2,7). Formulations of triclopyr ester have proven the most successful for both aerial and ground applications, including basal and stem treatment (1,2). The registration status of herbicides is subject to change. Consultation with local extension agents is advised when considering herbicide use. Damaging Agents- Few diseases or insects are reported to affect growth and survival of giant chinkapin (6,9), but it is susceptible to heart-rotting fungi, such as Phellinus igniarius (9). It is resistant to chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) despite its close relationship to chestnut. Common leaf fungi appear to do little harm. Twig fungi are reported to be secondary to other agents of damage, and root and butt rots are rare. Although in general giant chinkapin has few insect pests, seed-infesting species, such as the filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus), may play a significant local role in impeding regeneration. In portions of its range, certain foliage feeders, such as California oakworm (Phryganidia californica), can reduce growth. The roundheaded borer (Phymatodes aeneus) is occasionally found in dying branches and thin-barked portions of the bole (6).",Life History,Giant Chinkapin,castanopsis,chrysophylla,hardwood,10,0
"A small market exists for giant chinkapin wood for furniture and cabinet stock, paneling, and decorative veneer (16). There are several reasons for its limited use, despite its ability to develop a tall, clear, straight bole under average growing conditions. It rarely occurs naturally in pure stands, being typically a minor hardwood component of predominantly coniferous forests. Also, most mills in the conifer-dominated industry of the Pacific States will not take giant chinkapin because of added inventory problems for little additional volume. Finally, it is one of the most difficult hardwoods in the United States to cure, as it tends to check badly (16), and transportation costs keep it from being moved long distances to the few mills equipped to process it. As a consequence, giant chinkapin is often felled and left on the site or is bucked into firewood. Giant chinkapin is an important species for wildlife because of the cover and food it provides. Its ability to grow on harsh sites on infertile soils, and to sprout rapidly after fire, also makes it important for soil stabilization in watersheds.",Special Uses,Giant Chinkapin,castanopsis,chrysophylla,hardwood,16,0
"Giant sequoia groves lie wholly within the Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer type-SAF (Society of American Foresters) forest cover type 243 (8). A grove is distinguished from similar mesic habitats in this type only by the presence of giant sequoia itself: no other species is restricted to the groves (33). Nowhere does giant sequoia grow in a pure stand, although in a few small areas it approaches this condition (16). Based on density or canopy coverage, groves typically are dominated strongly by California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana), despite the presence of emergent individuals of giant sequoia that overtop the canopy. Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) is a characteristic associate. Incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) at low elevations and California red fir (Abies magnifica) at high elevations may rival California white fir for dominance. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) often occupy drier sites within the grove boundaries. Trees less commonly associated with giant sequoia include Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica), white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), Scouler willow (Salix scoulerana), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis). Shrub species most often found in giant sequoia groves are bush chinkapin (Castanopsis sempervirens), mountain misery (Chamaebatia foliolosa), mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus), littleleaf ceanothus (C. parvifolius), deerbrush (C. integerrimus), snowbrush (C. velutinus), greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), western azalea (Rhododendron occidentale), Ribes spp., Rosa spp., and Rubus spp. (16,17,33,36). Stand structure and species frequency vary substantially with elevation, latitude, exposure, soil moisture, and time since fire or other disturbance. In general, protection of groves from fire has resulted in increased prevalence of California white fir, reduced regeneration of giant sequoia and pines, and reduced density of shrubs. The age-class distribution of giant sequoia also varies widely among groves. Most groves today, however, appear to lack sufficient young giant sequoias to maintain the present density of mature trees in the future. In these groves, giant sequoia regeneration evidently has been declining over a period of 100 to 500 years or more (33).",Associated Forest Cover,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,1,1
"Giant sequoia is found in a humid climate characterized by dry summers. Mean annual precipitation in the groves varies from about 900 to 1400 mm (35 to 55 in), with high year-to-year variation. Less than 30 mm. (1.2 in) usually falls between June 1 and September 30. Most of the precipitation comes in the form of snow between October and April. Mean annual snowfall ranges from 366 to 500 cm (144 to 197 in), and snow depths of 2.0 m (6.6 ft) or greater are common in midwinter (32). Mean daily maximum temperatures for July for typical groves are 24° to 29° C (75° to 84° F). Mean minimum temperatures for January vary from 1° to -6° C (34° to 21° F). Extremes are about -24° and 40° C (-12° and 104° F) (32,37). Low temperatures seem to be a limiting factor for giant sequoia at the upper elevational limits of its range, as well as in areas with severe winters where the species has been introduced. Distribution of the species at low elevations is limited mainly by deficient soil moisture during the growing season (34).",Climate,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,2,1
"No races of giant sequoia exist (36). Fourteen horticultural forms are known, only two of which are common (16). Hybridization of giant sequoia with redwood has been reported in the Soviet Union but is unconfirmed in the western literature (19).",Hybrids,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,9,1
"The natural range of giant sequoia is restricted to about 75 groves scattered over a 420-km (260-mi) belt, nowhere more than about 24 km (15 mi) wide, extending along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada in central California (16). The northern two-thirds of the range, from the American River in Placer County southward to the Kings River, takes in only eight widely disjunct groves. The remaining groves, including all the large ones, are concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern Tulare County (33). Varying in size from less than 1 to 1619 ha (1 to 4,000 acres), the groves occupy a total area of 14 410 ha (35,607 acres) (17). - The native range of giant sequoia.",Native Range,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,11,1
"Isolation of the groves, or populations, of giant sequoia has existed sufficiently long for a number of population differences to become discernible. A recent study (12) found differences among populations on the basis of isozyme analyses, percent germination, and frequency distribution of cotyledon numbers. Levels of heterozygosity differed between the northern and southern parts of the range. Provenance tests in West Germany showed differences in cold hardiness and early growth among populations (14,20,23). Bark pattern of mature trees varies among groves (16). Somewhat surprisingly, however, genetic variability of giant sequoia is distinctly subdued when compared with that of other Sierra Nevada conifers and other trees in general (21).",Population Differences,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Giant sequoia is monoecious; male and female cone buds form during late summer. Pollination takes place between the middle of April and the middle of May when the female conelets are only two or three times as large in diameter as the twigs bearing them. Fertilization usually occurs in August, by which time cones are almost full-size. Embryos develop rapidly during the next summer and reach maturity at the end of the second growing season. The egg-shaped mature cones, 5 to 9 cm (2.0 to 3.5 in) in length, yield an average of 200 seeds each (16,17,36). Seed Production and Dissemination- Cones bearing fertile seeds have been observed on trees as young as 10 years of age, but the large cone crops associated with reproductive maturity usually do not appear before about 150 or 200 years. Unlike most other organisms, giant sequoia seems to continue its reproductive ability unabated into old age. The largest specimens (not necessarily the oldest) bear heavy crops of cones containing viable seeds (16,36). Giant sequoias have serotinous cones which, at maturity, may remain attached to the stems without opening to release seeds. For 20 years or more, cones may retain viable seeds and continue to photosynthesize and grow, their peduncles producing annual rings that can be used to determine cone age (16,36). A typical mature giant sequoia produces an average of 1,500 new cones each year, although variability among trees and from year to year is great. Cones produced during years with ample soil moisture are more numerous (more than 20,000 cones on one large tree in an exceptional year) and yield seeds of greater viability than those produced in dry years. The upper third of the crown generally bears at least two-thirds of the cone crop. Because of extended cone retention, a mature tree may have 10,000 to 30,000 cones at any given time, two-thirds of which may be green and closed, and the remainder opened, brown, and largely seedless (16,17). Estimates of percent germination of seeds removed from green cones range from about 20 to 40 percent (11,17,38). A number of variables, however, account for departures from these average values. Trees growing on rocky sites yield seeds with substantially higher germinability than those on bottom lands with deeper soils. Larger seeds germinate in higher percentages than small ones. In tests of cone age, germination increased from 20 percent for seeds from 2-year-old cones to 52 percent for 5-year-old cones, then dropped to 27 percent for cones 8 years of age. Germinability also varies with cone location in the crown, seed position within the cones, and among groves (16). Artificial stratification of seeds for 60 days or more resulted in faster germination, but not in higher germination percent (11). Browning or drying of cones, with subsequent shrinkage of scales and dispersal of seeds, is brought about largely by three agents, two of which are animals. The more effective of the two is Phymatodes nitidus, a long-horned wood-boring beetle. The larvae of the beetle mine the fleshy cone scales and cone shafts, damaging occasional seeds only incidentally. As vascular connections are severed, scales successively dry and shrink, allowing the seeds to fall. Cones damaged during the summer open several scales at a time, beginning during late summer and fall, and continuing for 6 months to 1 year (17). The second animal having a significant role in giant sequoia regeneration is the chickaree, or Douglas squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasi). The fleshy green scales of younger sequoia cones are a major food source for the squirrel. The seeds, too small to have much food value, are dislodged as the scales are eaten. During years of high squirrel densities, the animals tend to cut large numbers of cones and store and eat them at caches. When squirrels are few, most of the cone consumption is in tree crowns-a habit more conducive to effective seed dispersal. The squirrels are active all year (17). The chickaree prefers cones 2 to 5 years old, whereas Phymatodes is more prevalent in cones at least 4 years old. The combined activities of these animals help to ensure that seeds of all age classes are shed, and that rate of seedfall is roughly constant throughout the year and from year to year, despite variability in new cone production. An average rate is about 1 million seeds per hectare (400,000/acre) per year (17). The third and perhaps most important agent of seed release is fire. Hot air produced by locally intense fire and convected high into the canopy can dry cones, resulting in release of enormous quantities of seed over small areas-for example, 20 million/ha (8 million/acre) (17). This increased seedfall coincides both spatially and temporally with fire-related seedbed conditions favorable for seed germination and seedling survival (fig. 2). Giant sequoia seeds are well adapted for wind dispersal. They are light (average 200,000/kg [91,000/lb]), winged, and fall in still air at a rate of 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) per second. Winds common in late summer and winter storms in the Sierra Nevada can disperse seeds more than 0.4 km (0.25 mi) from the tall crowns of mature trees (16,36). Cone and seed insects other than Phymatodes have only a minor impact on seed production (17). Birds and mammals exert a negligible effect on giant sequoia seeds on the ground. Sequoia seeds consistently rank at or near the bottom in food preference tests that include seeds of associated species, primarily because they are small and contain little energy (17,38). Seedling Development- Natural reproduction in giant sequoia is an unusually tenuous process. Of the enormous numbers of seeds shed each year, extremely few encounter the combination of conditions necessary to become successfully established seedlings. In contrast with most coniferous seeds, a large majority of seeds of giant sequoia die from desiccation and solar radiation soon after reaching the forest floor, especially during the summer. In one study, viability of seeds removed from fresh cones and placed on the ground dropped from 45 percent to 0 in 20 days. Seeds collected from the forest floor showed an average viability of 1 percent (17). Seed dormancy is not evident in giant sequoia, so surviving seeds germinate as soon as conditions are favorable (17). Germination is epigeal. The most significant requirement for germination is an adequate supply of moisture and protection of the seed from desiccation. This is best provided by moist, friable mineral soil that covers the seed to a depth of 1 cm (0.4 in), and that is partially shaded to reduce surface drying. A wide range of temperatures is acceptable for germination. The generally sandy soils of the groves normally provide the additional requirement of adequate aeration and the optimum pH range of 6 to 7 (38). Because of rapid percolation, however, adequate moisture retention for germination and initial root development is often marginal. Seeds dropped just before the first snow or just as the snow melts may have the best chance of germinating and becoming successfully established. Seedlings that produce roots early in the season during favorable soil moisture conditions are more likely to survive the dry summer. The first stage of germination-extension of the radicle-sometimes takes place beneath the snow (16). Thick litter usually dries too quickly for seeds to germinate, and virtually all seedlings that do get started die before their roots can penetrate to mineral soil (17,36). Only in exceptionally wet years do significant numbers of seedlings become established on undisturbed forest floor. The role of damping-off fungi in the mortality of natural giant sequoia seedlings is not well known, but they are almost certainly a greater problem on thick litter than on mineral soil (2,25). After seedlings are established on more favorable seedbeds, a light covering of litter can moderate soil surface temperatures and retard drying (37). Seedlings rarely become established in dense grass cover, probably because moisture is depleted in the surface soil early in the season (36). Soil disturbance and increased availability of light and moisture resulting from past logging in some of the groves have led to establishment of several fine young-growth stands dominated by giant sequoia. Mechanical seedbed preparation is currently a legitimate regeneration option in some groves, although such treatment is inconsistent with management direction in most of the natural range of the species. Of the various types of natural disturbances that may remove litter and bare mineral soil, fire is undoubtedly the most significant. Locally intense or highly consumptive fires are more effective than light surface fires or physical disturbance in promoting germination and subsequent seedling survival and early growth (17). The resulting short-lived friable soil condition facilitates seed penetration beneath the surface and root penetration following germination. Increased wettability in the surface soil layers resulting from high temperatures appears to improve water penetration and retention in the zones important for seeds and young seedlings. Fire also may kill some understory trees, thereby providing more light to speed the development (especially root penetration) of the shade-intolerant giant sequoia seedlings. Additional benefits include providing a surge of available nutrients, reducing populations of fungi potentially pathogenic to seedlings, and killing seeds and rootstocks of competing vegetation (17). On the other hand, the dark surface and possibly increased insolation resulting from fire may cause more desiccation and heat killing of giant sequoia seeds and seedlings at the surface. Also, populations of endomycorrhizal fungi may be severely reduced temporarily (17). And low-consumption fires, rather than reducing competing vegetation, may instead greatly stimulate germination and sprouting of shrubs. Partially burned litter, in terms of its suitability for successful seedling establishment, ranks between undisturbed forest floor and areas subjected to hot fires (38). First-year giant sequoia seedlings established on treated-bulldozed or burned or both-areas were 30 to 150 times more numerous than those on undisturbed forest floor (17). Mortality of first-year seedlings during the 3 summer months on one treated area averaged 39 percent, with an additional 25 percent dying during the next 9 months. Desiccation was the primary cause of mortality in the summer. During a year of increased seasonal precipitation, mortality attributable to desiccation decreased, whereas that caused by insects increased to 25 percent of total mortality. Heat canker, damage by birds and mammals, and fungal attacks were of minor importance. In the same study, direct mortality of first-year seedlings from insect predation ranged from 3 to 18 percent of all seedlings present. Some of the significant additional insect damage probably caused delayed mortality. Largest seedling losses were in areas recently disturbed, especially by fire, probably because alternative food sources were reduced temporarily. Insects responsible for the damage were early instars of Pristocauthophilus pacificus, a camel cricket, and larvae of the geometrids Sabulodes caberata and Pero behrensaria. Survival of sequoia seedlings for a 7- to 9-year period was 27 percent on areas subjected to a hot burn as opposed to 3.5 percent on other treated substrates. No seedlings survived in undisturbed areas. In another instance, only 1.4 percent of seedlings established following light surface burning were alive after two summers. Mortality slows substantially after the first 2 or 3 years. At the end of 3 years, surviving seedlings usually have root systems that penetrate the soil to depths that supply adequate moisture through the summer, or to about 36 cm (14 in). Height growth of giant sequoia seedlings in the groves is relatively slow during the first few years, presumably because of competition for light and moisture from the larger trees. Seedlings 7 to 10 years old had grown at an average rate of about 4 cm (1.6 in) per year. Periodic annual height increment from 10 to 20 years was only 5 em (2 in). Seedlings grew significantly faster on areas subjected to hot burns than they did elsewhere (17). In contrast, giant sequoia seedlings in the open grow rapidly and, given an even start, can outgrow any associated tree species. Height growth up to 60 cm (24 in) per year is not uncommon (9). Up to 2 or 3 years of age, seedlings growing in dense shade (less than 25 percent of full sunlight) survive about as well as others, but grow poorly and develop abnormally (37). At higher light levels, one study found moderate reduction in height growth compared with seedlings in full sunlight (37), whereas another study found no significant effect of reduced light on height growth (17). The adverse effects of shade on older giant sequoias are more conspicuous with respect to both mortality and growth reduction. Vegetative Reproduction- Giant sequoias up to about 20 years of age may produce stump sprouts subsequent to injury (19). Unlike redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), older trees normally do not sprout from stumps or roots. A recent report (30), however, noted sprouts on two small stumps from suppressed trees about 85 years old. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from the bole when old branches are lost by fire or breakage (17,36). Cuttings from juvenile donors root quickly and in high percentages (up to 94 percent) (3,10,12). Limited success has been achieved in rooting cuttings from older (30- or 40-year-old) trees (3,10). Differences in vegetative regeneration capacities between juvenile and older donors may be reduced if cuttings are taken at the time of budbreak, instead of during the dormant period (24).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- One tree species has a greater diameter than giant sequoia, three grow taller, and one lives longer (16). In terms of volume, however, the giant sequoia is undisputedly the world's largest tree. The most massive specimen, the General Sherman tree, located in Sequoia National Park, has an estimated bole volume of 1486 m³ (52,500 ft³) (13). The greatest known height for the species is 94.5 m (310 ft), and the greatest mean d.b.h.- for the General Grant tree, in Kings Canyon National Park- is 881 cm (347 in). The indicated mean d.b.h. includes a large abnormal buttress; excluding this abnormality gives a more realistic estimate of the maximum mean d.b.h. for the species-approximately 823 cm (324 in) (13). Mature specimens commonly reach a diameter of 305 to 610 cm (120 to 240 in) above the butt swell and average about 76 m (250 ft) in height (16). A notable characteristic of mature giant sequoias that contributes substantially to their great volume is the slight taper of the bole-a feature more prominent in this species than in any other Sierra Nevada conifer (16). In contrast, young open-grown giant sequoias taper markedly. The greatest known age of a giant sequoia is 3,200 years, determined from a stump count of rings (16). Calculations based on increment borings yield age estimates of 2,000 to 3,000 years for many living trees. Beyond the seedling stage, giant sequoia unhindered by an overstory continues to grow at least as well as associated species of the same age. In both clearcuts and group selection cuts on a high site in the central Sierra Nevada, it has outgrown other conifers in plantations up to 18 years of age. Furthermore, giant sequoia appears less susceptible than associated conifers to growth reductions caused by shrub competition (18). In a survey of California plantations up to 50 years of age in which giant sequoia had been planted, it outgrew other conifers (mostly ponderosa pine) in most instances in which species differed significantly in height or diameter growth. In the best plantations, giant sequoia averaged 0.5 to 0.7 m (1.6 to 2.3 ft) per year in height growth, and 1.3 to 2.0 cm (0.5 to 0.8 in) in diameter growth per year (9). Yields of second-growth stands dominated by giant sequoia were found to equal or slightly exceed those of second-growth mixed-conifer stands on the same high sites (site index 53 m [175 ft] at base age 300 years) (6). Volumes at selected stand ages were as follows: In cubic measure, mean annual increment at age 86 was approximately 9 m³/ha (126 ft³/acre). In contrast to the brittleness and low tensile strength of the wood of old-growth giant sequoia, young-growth trees have wood properties comparable to those of young-growth redwood (5,28). Because most groves have protected status, the potential of the species for fiber production within its natural range is limited. It has been planted widely and often successfully in many parts of the world, however. As in California plantations, on the proper sites it outperforms most other species (7). An 80-year-old giant sequoia plantation in Belgium, for example, grew at an average annual rate of 36 to 49 m³/ha (514 to 700 ft³/acre) (20). Many foresters see considerable potential for giant sequoia as a major timber-producing species of the world. In old-growth groves, rapid height growth continues on the better sites for at least 100 years, producing dense conical crowns. At 400 years, trees range in height from about 34 to 73 m (110 to 240 ft). The rate of height growth declines beyond 400 years, and the typical tree levels off near 76 m (250 ft) at an age of 800 to 1,500 years (17). Analysis of a large old-growth population showed an average d.b.h. of 48 cm (18.9 in) at 100 years, 132 cm (52.0 in) at 400 years, 219 cm (86.1 in) at 800 years, and 427 cm (168.0 in) at 2,000 years (17). Although radial growth gradually decreases with age, volume increment generally is sustained into old age. The General Sherman tree, at an approximate age of 2,500 years, has a current radial growth rate at breast height of about 1 mm (0.04 in) per year (16). Average volume increment for this tree since 1931 has been estimated by different methods at 1.13 m³ (40 ft³) per year (16) and 1.44 m³ (51 ft³) per year (13). Therefore, the world's largest tree also may be, in terms of volume increment, the world's fastest-growing tree. A related conclusion can be applied to the species: the enormous size attained by giant sequoia results not only from its longevity, but also- despite the apparent decadence of most veterans- from its continued rapid growth into old age (16). Lower branches of giant sequoia die fairly readily from shading, but trees less than 100 years old retain most of their dead branches. Boles of mature trees generally are free of branches to a height of 30 to 45 m (98 to 148 ft) (36). Rooting Habit- During the first few years, the root system of giant sequoia seedlings consists of a taproot with few laterals-a habit that facilitates survival during dry summers (36). The ratio of root length to shoot height during this period is about 2 to 2.5, with drier sites having higher ratios (17). After 6 to 8 years, lateral root growth predominates, and elongation of the taproot practically stops (36). Roots of a mature tree commonly extend 30 m (100 ft) or more from the bole in well-drained soils, and occupy an area of 0.3 ha (0.7 acre) or more. Along drainage bottoms or edges of meadows, the radial extent of the root system may be no more than 12 to 15 m (40 to 50 ft). The largest lateral roots are usually no more than 0.3 m (1 ft) in diameter. Few roots extend deeper than 1 m (3 ft), and even less in areas with a high water table. Most of the abundant feeder roots are within the upper 0.6 m (2 ft) of soil. Concentrations of feeder roots often are high at the mineral soil surface (16). Immature trees, both in the groves and in older plantings, are notably windfirm (20). Considering the shallowness of the root system and the great aboveground mass of large giant sequoias, it is remarkable that so many of these giants, especially leaners, remain standing for so long (16). Root grafting is common in giant sequoia (16,36). Reaction to Competition- Giant sequoia is shade intolerant throughout its life. Of its common coniferous associates, ponderosa pine is also intolerant, sugar pine is intermediate in tolerance, incense-cedar is intermediate to tolerant, and California white fir is tolerant (17). Fires or other disturbances that bare mineral soil and open the canopy characteristically benefit intolerant species, including giant sequoia, and move plant communities to earlier successional stages. In contrast, successful regeneration of giant sequoia in shade and in the absence of disturbance is less likely than that of any associated conifer (17). Once established, and with adequate light, young giant sequoias maintain dominance over competitors through rapid growth. In dense thickets, however, trees stagnate and recover slowly if released (36). At maturity, giant sequoias are the tallest trees in the forest. Although conspicuous in late successional communities dominated by California white fir, giant sequoia is not a true climax-stage species, because it fails to reproduce itself successfully in an undisturbed forest. Instead, mature trees are successional relicts because they live for many centuries while continuing to meet their light requirements by virtue of their emergent crowns (16). If various natural agents of disturbance-especially fire-operated freely, giant sequoia groves would consist of a roughly steady-state mosaic of even-aged groups of trees and shrubs in various stages of succession. The patchy nature of vegetational units would correspond to the pattern of disturbances. In the absence of disturbance, however, successional pathways converge toward a multilayered climax forest of pure California white fir (4). In fact, since the advent of fire suppression, density of California white fir has increased markedly, while densities of early successional stage species have decreased (26). Damaging Agents- Fire is the most universal and probably most serious damaging agent of giant sequoia in its natural range (36). Seedlings and saplings of giant sequoia, like those of most other tree species, are highly susceptible to mortality or serious injury by fire. However, in those locations most favorable for successful establishment and early growth-that is, mineral soil seedbeds and well-lighted openings-fuels tend to be sparser and to accumulate more slowly than in adjacent forested areas. The more vigorous seedlings and saplings thus may be large enough to survive a light fire by the time one occurs. Larger giant sequoias, because of their thick nonresinous bark and elevated crowns, are more resistant to fire damage than associated species. Nevertheless, repeated fires over the centuries sear through the bark of a tree's base, kill the cambium, and produce an ever-enlarging scar. Almost all of the larger trees have fire scars, many of which encompass a large percentage of the basal circumference (16). Few veterans have been killed by fire alone, but consequent reduction in supporting wood predisposes a tree to falling. Furthermore, fire scars provide entry for fungi responsible for root disease and heart rot (29). Decayed wood, in turn, is more easily consumed by subsequent fires. The net result is further structural weakening of the tree. In addition, fire scars have been cited as the main cause of dead tops, so common in older trees (35). Lightning strikes, besides starting ground fires, sometimes knock out large portions of crowns or ignite dead tops. Mature trees seldom are killed by lightning, however (16). Old giant sequoias most commonly die by toppling. Weakening of the roots and lower bole by fire and decay is primarily responsible (16,29). The extreme weight of the trees, coupled with their shallow roots, increases the effects of this weakening, especially in leaning trees. Other causative factors include wind, water-softened soils, undercutting by streams, and heavy snow loads (16). Although diseases are less troublesome for giant sequoia in its natural range than for most other trees, the species is not as immune to disease as once assumed (1). Heartwood of downed sequoia logs is extremely durable, sometimes remaining largely intact for thousands of years. The heartwood of living trees, however, is less resistant to decay (2). At least nine fungi have been found associated with decayed giant sequoia wood. Of these, Heterobasidion annosum, Armillaria mellea, Poria incrassata, and P. albipellucida probably are most significant (29). The first two species also are serious root pathogens. Diseases generally do not kill trees past the seedling stage directly, but rather by contributing to root or stem failure. No other types of diseases, including seedling diseases, are known to be significant problems within the natural range of giant sequoia (2). In nurseries and when planted outside its natural range, however, giant sequoia is highly susceptible to, and sometimes rapidly killed by, a number of organisms that may attack it at any stage from seedlings to mature trees (1,25,39). Insect depredations do not seriously harm giant sequoias older than about 2 years, although sometimes they may reduce vigor (17). Carpenter ant (Camponotus spp.) galleries in decayed wood of tree bases evidently are not a direct cause of tree failure. Carpenter ants and other insects may facilitate the entry and spread of decay fungi, although the importance of such a role is not well known (29). Like disease injury, damage by insects is more significant outside the tree's natural range. Of various types of human impact on giant sequoia in the groves (16,17,29), the most significant has been fire exclusion. The damage caused by fire is outweighed by its benefits in perpetuating the species. Fire is necessary to create and maintain conditions favorable for regeneration (17). Furthermore, the elimination of frequent fires has permitted a large buildup of both dead and live fuels, and an associated increase in the potential for catastrophic crown fires. Agencies responsible for managing most of the groves currently have programs designed to reintroduce fire into giant sequoia ecosystems (15,27,31).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,14,1
"Soils are derived from a variety of rock types. Most groves are on granitic-based residual and alluvial soils, and three are on glacial outwash from granite. Schistose, dioritic, and andesitic rocks also are common parent materials (16,36). Typical soil series are Dome, Shaver, Holland, and Chaix. Characteristic soil families are coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Dystric Xerochrepts; coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Entic (and Typic) Xerumbrepts of the order Inceptisols; and fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs of the order Alfisols. The natural range of the species lies mostly within the mesic temperature regime, extending only a short distance into the frigid regime, and wholly within the xeric moisture regime (22). Giant sequoia grows best in deep, well-drained sandy loams. Its density also is much greater in the more mesic sites, such as drainage bottoms and meadow edges, than in other habitats within a grove. Total acreage of these productive sites is small, however. Relatively shallow and rocky soils support vigorous individuals, some large, wherever the trees can become established and where underground water is available to maintain them (16,32). Soil pH ranges mostly from 5.5 to 7.5, with an average of about 6.5 (22). Long-term site occupancy by giant sequoia appears to develop a soil of high fertility, good base status, and low bulk density (40). Adequate soil moisture throughout the dry growing season is critical for successful establishment of giant sequoia regeneration, although seedlings do not survive in wet soils (36). One study has shown more available soil moisture within a grove, possibly associated with subterranean flow from higher elevations, than in adjacent forested areas (34). Except for its moisture content, soil apparently plays only a minor role in influencing the distribution of the species, as evidenced by the considerable variability in parent material among groves and the fact that giant sequoia grows vigorously when planted in diverse soils around the world (16). Elevations of the groves generally range from 1400 to 2000 m (4,590 to 6,560 ft) in the north, and 1700 to 2150 m (5,580 to 7,050 ft) in the south. The lowest natural occurrence of the species is 830 m (2,720 ft) and the highest is 2700 m (8,860 ft). The eight northern groves are all on slopes of a generally southern aspect. Between the Kings River and the southern boundary of Sequoia National Park, groves appear on north and south slopes with about equal frequency. Farther south, aspects are predominantly northerly (32).",Soils and Topography,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,15,1
"Within its natural range, giant sequoia is valued primarily for esthetic and scientific purposes. Outside this range, it is highly regarded as an ornamental in several parts of the United States and in numerous other countries (16). Some interest has been expressed for utilizing it in Christmas tree plantations.",Special Uses,Giant Sequoia,sequoiadendron,giganteum,conifer,16,1
"Grand fir is either a seral or climax species in different forest types within its range. On moist sites it grows rapidly enough to compete with other seral species in the dominant overstory. On dry sites it becomes a shade-tolerant understory and eventually assumes dominance as climax conditions are approached. Grand fir is represented in 17 forest cover types of western North America: it is the predominant species in only one, Grand Fir (Society of American Foresters Type 213) (26). It is a major component of six other cover types: Western Larch (Type 212), Western White Pine (Type 215), Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Western Hemlock (Type 224), Western Redcedar (Type 228), and Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock (Type 227). Grand fir appears sporadically in 10 other cover types. In northern Idaho, grand fir is the major climax tree species in seven habitat types and is an important seral tree in the Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, and Abies lasciocarpa series of habitat types (5). The Montana forest ecological classification recognizes an Abies grandis series of three habitat types in which grand fir is the major climax tree (23). It is also a minor climax or seral tree in four other types in Montana. In central Idaho, Steele and others (28) described an Abies grandis series that includes nine habitat types and five phases in which grand fir is the climax tree. The Abies grandis zone is the most extensive midslope forest zone in the Cascade Range of Oregon and southern Washington and the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. Grand fir is the climax tree species in 12 plant associations (15,18). It is also an important component of the mixed conifer communities in the Willamette Valley and Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon (16). In addition, grand fir grows sporadically in the Tsuga heterophylla, Picea sitchensis, and Abies amabilis zones in the coastal forests of Washington and Oregon (11). Grand fir sometimes grows in pure stands but is much more common in mixed coniferous and hardwood forests. In forests east of the Cascade crest, it is associated with western white pine (Pinus monticola), western larch (Larix occidentalis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and in certain areas, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), white fir (Abies concolor), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis), and Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana). Associates of grand fir in northwestern Oregon, western Washington, and southwestern British Columbia include Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), and Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), in addition to western redcedar, western hemlock, western larch, and Douglas-fir. It also is associated with these coast hardwoods: bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), red alder (Alnus rubra), black cottonwood, and Oregon white oak. In southwestern Oregon and northwestern California, at the southern limits of the range, grand fir is found with redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and at higher elevations with Shasta red fir, white fir, noble fir (Abies procera), subalpine fir, and western white pine. Shrubs commonly associated with grand fir include pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), bristly black currant (Ribes lacustre), Saskatoon serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), birchleaf spirea (Spiraea betulifolia), huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.), Utah honeysuckle (Lonicera utahensis), mallow ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), baldhip rose (Rosa gymnocarpa), princes-pine (Chimaphila spp.), Spalding rose (Rosa nutkana var. hispida), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), creeping hollygrape (Berberis repens), willow (Salix spp.), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), and pyrola (Pyrola spp.). Herbaceous species commonly found in various associations with grand fir include queenscup (Clintonia uniflora), false solomons-seal (Smilacina stellata), goldthread (Coptis occidentalis), Pacific trillium (Trillium ovatum), sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum), pathfinder (trailplant) (Adenocaulon bicolor), wildginger (Asarum caudatum), Piper anemone (Anemone piperi), violet (Viola spp.), sandwort (Arenaria macrophylla), heartleaf arnica (Arnica cordifolia), strawberry Fragaria spp.), rattlesnake plantain (Goodyera oblongifolia), western meadowrue (Thalictrum occidentale), coolwort (Tiarella spp.), fairybells (Disporum oreganum), white hawkweed (Hieracium albiflorum), and sweetroot (Osmorhiza spp.). Graminoids frequently associated with grand fir are Columbia brome (Bromus vulgaris), pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens), western fescue (Festuca occidentalis), and sedge (Carex spp.). Additional species are associated with grand fir in the coastal region, where it grows with western hemlock, coastal Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, and redwood.",Associated Forest Cover,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,1,1
"Grand fir is found on a wide variety of sites. Average annual precipitation in its territory ranges from 510 to more than 2540 mm (20 to 100 in) in western Washington and on Vancouver Island. Annual precipitation in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon averages 360 to 990 mm (14 to 39 in). In northern Idaho, average annual precipitation is 510 to 1270 mm (20 to 50 in). Most of this precipitation occurs during winter. Generally 15 to 25 percent of the annual precipitation occurs during the growing season, May through August. On Vancouver Island, where average annual precipitation ranges from 680 to 2820 mm (27 to 111 in), only 50 to 130 mm (2 to 5 in) of rain falls during June, July, and August. Average annual snowfall ranges from a few centimeters on some coastal sites to more than 1270 cm (500 in) in the mountains of the interior (9). Average annual temperatures range from 6° to 10° C (43° to 50° F); the average growing season temperature is 14° to 19° C (57° to 66° F). The frost-free season varies, ranging from about 60 to more than 250 days, and is very irregular from year to year. Frosts may occur in any month in the interior. The average growing season ranges from only 100 to 140 days in northern Idaho, 185 days on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington, and 250 or more days in northern California (9).",Climate,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,2,1
Grand fir crosses with both the concolor and lowiana varieties of white fir. Several studies have shown hybridization and introgression between grand fir and white fir in a broad zone extending from the Klamath Mountains of northern California through southwestern Oregon and through the Oregon Cascade Range into northeastern Oregon and west-central Idaho (30). Grand fir has been crossed with several European and Asiatic species (19). Natural hybrids have been reported between grand fir and subalpine fir in northern Idaho (6).,Hybrids,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,9,1
"Grand fir grows in the stream bottoms, valleys, and mountain slopes of northwestern United States and southern British Columbia. Its wide geographical distribution is from latitude 51° to 39° N. and from longitude 125° to 114° W. In the Pacific coast region it grows in southern British Columbia mainly on the lee side of Vancouver Island and the adjacent mainland, in the interior valleys and lowlands of western Washington and Oregon, and in northwestern California as far south as Sonoma County. The range in the continental interior extends from the Okanogan and Kootenay Lakes in southern British Columbia south through eastern Washington, northern Idaho, western Montana west of the Continental Divide, and northeastern Oregon. The best commercial stands of grand fir are in the Nez Perce and Clearwater regions of northern Idaho (9). - The native range of grand fir.",Native Range,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,11,1
"There are no recognized varieties of grand fir, although a green coastal form and gray interior form are often recognized. Five fairly distinct climatic forms of grand fir have been identified. The differences are mainly physiological and ecological (9). Provenance trials with grand fir in Europe have resulted in ranking U.S. seed origins. Seed sources west of the Cascade crest are preferred for planting in England and the lowland sites in Europe (20). Significant differences in height growth between trees from sources east and west of the Cascade crest have been reported but average growth of westside and interior seedlings is generally about the same (29). Most of the genetic variation available for tree improvement appears to be among stands but genetic gains can also be made by selecting individuals within stands.",Population Differences,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Grand fir trees are monoecious; male and female flowers are borne in clusters on branchlets of the previous season's growth in different parts of the same tree. Female flowers, producing cones and seeds, are short, spherical to cylindrical, and stand singly and erect on the uppermost part of the crown. Male flowers, pollen-bearing only, are ovoid or cylindrical and hang singly from the lower side of branches below the female flowers. This arrangement favors cross-fertilization. The cones mature in one season. Time of flowering may vary over several months, depending on temperatures during the weeks preceding flowering. Flowering occurs from late March to mid-May at lower elevations of most coastal locations, and in June at the higher elevations of the inland locations. The cones, mostly yellowish-green and occasionally greenish-purple, ripen from August to September of the same year, and seeds are dispersed approximately 1 month later (32). Extreme frosts may occasionally inhibit normal cone and seed development. Several species of insects feed on the buds, conelets, and seeds of grand fir, sometimes destroying 10 to 25 percent of the year's seed crop (9). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production begins at about 20 years of age and increases with age, diameter, and vigor of the tree. Eight-year observations of permanent sample plots in Idaho show that grand fir produced the fewest seeds of the species associated with western white pine. Grand fir produced no good crops and only two fair crops, while western white pine produced two good crops and three fair crops. During the same 8-year period, western hemlock produced five good crops and two fair crops (9). In the coastal forests of Washington, grand fir ranked higher than western white pine and intermediate among upper slope species in number of seeds produced per tree (22). Other sources place the interval between good seed crops at 2 to 3 years (10,32). In the Inland Empire, a good cone crop for grand fir is considered to be more than 40 cones per tree. A fair crop is 21 to 40 cones per tree. Grand fir seeds caught annually in seed traps on two sample plots averaged 42,000/ha (17,000 acre) on the Kaniksu National Forest and 58,100/ha (23,500 acre) on the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. Eight-year observations of seed traps under a 300-year-old stand on the Priest River Experimental Forest yielded 31,600 grand fir seeds per hectare (12,800 acre) annually (9). The yield of cleaned seeds ranges from 26,200 to 63,100/kg (11,900 to 28,700/lb) and averages 40,500/kg (18,400/lb) (32). When the cones are ripe, the scales fall away and release the large-winged seeds, leaving only the central spike. Seeds are dispersed by the wind and rodents. Most of the seeds are disseminated in the early fall, about 5 percent falling before September 1 and 80 percent falling before the end of October. Seeds sufficient to produce adequate reproduction may be distributed up to 120 m (400 ft) from the parent tree, but the average distance is about 45 to 60 m (150 to 200 ft). Seeds in the duff remain viable through only one overwinter period (9). Seedling Development- Grand fir seeds germinate in the spring following one overwinter period on the ground. In natural stands, germination is quite variable but is seldom greater than 50 percent because of embryo dormancy, insect infestation, and the perishable nature of the seeds. Seeds are often so heavily infested with insects that an entire crop may be classed as a failure (9). Stratification under cool, moist conditions speeds germination. Grand fir seeds are typically stratified at 1° to 5° C (34° to 41° F) for 14 to 42 days before nursery sowing in the spring. Results of greenhouse germination tests of grand fir seeds are highly variable. In three sandflat germination tests in the northern Rockies, grand fir had the lowest germination percentage among major associates of the western white pine type (9). Average percentages were grand fir, 12; western larch, 30; Douglas-fir, 41; western white pine, 44; western hemlock, 65; and western redcedar, 73. As with other true firs, germination is epigeal. In reported tests, germinative capacity ranged from 0 to 93 percent and averaged 50 percent (32). The variability and average grand fir germination are about average for the true firs. Grand fir seed germination begins in late April or early May on exposed sites and a month later on protected sites where snow lingers late. It is practically completed by July 1 on exposed sites and by August 15 on protected sites. Germination is best on mineral soil, but on seed-tree cuttings, grand fir germinates nearly as well on duff as on any other surface (9). Studies of seedling survival indicate that more than 30 percent of grand fir seedlings die in the first season, and an additional 10 percent die in the second season. Losses drop off rapidly after the first 2 years, and seedlings 3 years old are fairly well established (9,24). Studies of mortality during the critical first year indicate that early season losses are due principally to biotic agents, especially damping-off fungi. Fungi-caused mortality is very irregular, however. Later in the season as the soil begins to dry and temperatures rise, mortality is due principally to heat from insolation and drought. Surface-soil temperatures are less important under shade or on sheltered sites, and under dense shade or on north slopes high temperatures do not cause death. Grand fir is relatively resistant to heat injury; it is equal to western white pine and Douglas-fir and more resistant than western larch, western hemlock, and western redcedar. Grand fir seedlings are relatively resistant to drought on areas exposed to full sun because deep initial root penetration protects them from drying of the surface soil. On heavily shaded, cool areas, drought is the most important physical cause of seedling mortality because initial root penetration is slow; even shallow drying of the surface soil may cause drought mortality despite ample soil moisture at deeper levels (9). Initial survival and growth of grand fir are favored by a moderate overwood shade. Under full sun it is largely subordinate to faster growing, shade-intolerant species. Under partial overwood shade, grand fir is aggressive enough to form a dominant part of the reproduction. After 20 to 30 years, it makes most rapid growth in the open (9). Vegetative Reproduction- No information is currently available.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Longevity of grand fir is intermediate among true firs; trees 250 years old are common and occasional trees may be more than 300 years old. On optimum sites in the coastal lowlands of Washington, mature grand firs reach heights of 43 to 61 m (140 to 200 ft) at 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) d.b.h.; occasionally they reach 76 m (250 ft) in height and 152 cm (60 in) in d.b.h. (11). Grand fir in the redwood forests of California reaches d.b.h. and heights as great as those attained in the coast Douglas-fir region. In northern Idaho grand fir normally grows to 35 to 46 m (115 to 151 ft) in height at 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 in) in d.b.h. On the pumice soils of eastern Oregon it attains height of 30 to 40 m (98 to 131 ft) with d.b.h. of 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 in). On exposed ridges of the Inland Empire, heights of 15 to 21 m (49 to 69 ft) and d.b.h. of 30 to 36 cm (12 to 14 in) are common (9). The rapid early height growth nearly equals that of Douglas-fir on the Pacific coast and western white pine in Idaho. On Vancouver Island and western Washington sites, growth of 79 to 89 cm (31 to 35 in) per year was reported. Trees 43 m (141 ft) tall at 50 years of age have been measured. In Idaho early height growth of 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) on average sites and 30 to 36 cm (12 to 14 in) on optimum sites has been reported. In the dry pumice soils of eastern Oregon, average juvenile height growth up to 13 cm (5 in) per year has been reported. On these dry sites good height growth is delayed until the taproots reach ground water. At some time in the third decade, height growth receives considerable impetus and annual height growths of 51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 in) or more are common (9). Among pole-size trees, growth is nearly equal to the more shade-intolerant western white pine and Douglas-fir with which it is commonly associated. Grand fir commonly outgrows the more tolerant western hemlock and western redcedar. Grand fir has been planted successfully in many European countries, where it is considered one of the most potentially productive species (2). In England, growth of grand fir plantations was compared with that of neighboring plantations of other commonly planted species, and the rate of growth of grand fir at 40 years of age frequently equaled or exceeded that of other species such as Sitka spruce, Norway spruce (Picea abies), and Douglas-fir (2). Grand fir seldom grows in pure stands except in areas of the Clearwater River drainage of north-central Idaho. Therefore, estimates of yields have value mainly in relation to mixed stands. Grand fir ranks among the most productive species in all the associations in which it grows. East of the Cascade crest in Oregon and Washington, yields of grand or white fir stands at age 100 years range from 476 to 1330 m³ /ha (6,800 to 19,000 ft³/acre) (4). In northern Idaho, where grand fir grows with western white pine, predicted yields of normal stands range from 470 to 1078 m/ha (6,720 to 15,400 W/acre) at age 100 (14). Estimates of mean annual growth range from 8 to 13 m³/ha (114 to 186 ft³/acre) in Idaho (27) and 6 to 10 m³/ha (86 to 143 ft³/acre) in Montana (23). On the more fertile soils of England, growth rates of 18 to 20 m³/ha (257 to 286 ft³/acre) to age 40 have been reported (2). Rooting Habit- The grand fir root system is intermediate in development among its associated tree species. The anchoring taproot does not grow as rapidly nor as deeply as dry site associates such as ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine, but it grows faster and deeper than wet site species such as western hemlock, western redcedar, and Engelmann spruce. Seedling roots penetrate the soil rapidly enough in full sunlight to survive drought conditions in duff and surface soil. Grand fir produces roots under shaded conditions, enabling it to survive in the understory. The adaptable root system contributes to the growth of grand fir over a wide range of sites and climatic conditions. A relatively deep taproot enables grand fir to survive and grow well on rather dry soils and exposed ridges. On moist sites, the taproot is largely replaced by more shallow lateral roots (9). Reaction to Competition- Grand fir is classed as shade-tolerant in all associations in which it occurs. In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, it is the climax type following Douglas-fir and Oregon white oak. In the Inland Empire it is more tolerant than any of its associates except western redcedar and western hemlock. It is the climax type on sites too dry for redcedar or hemlock. In coastal British Columbia, grand fir is similar to Sitka spruce in tolerance; that is, it is slightly more tolerant than Douglas-fir. It is the least shade-tolerant of the true firs in British Columbia and is much less tolerant than western hemlock, western redcedar, or Pacific silver fir. Grand fir is a versatile species that, although quite tolerant, has a growth rate nearly equal to that of western white pine. Grand fir is a dominant climax species in some habitat types and a long-lived seral species in other types. It usually grows in mixed-species stands where either even-aged or uneven-aged silviculture is practiced. In the zone of genetic intergrade between grand and white fir, it is not possible to separate the two species and their hybrids visually. Silvicultural prescriptions and treatments are applied as if they were one species. Where grand fir is desired under even-aged management, shelterwood cuttings are preferred because regeneration and early growth are best in partial shade. It also regenerates satisfactorily on most sites, however, following seed tree or clearcutting (3,24). Following seedling establishment, the overstory should be removed to encourage rapid growth in height and diameter. Under uneven-aged management, grand fir regenerates adequately and commonly outgrows the more tolerant western hemlock and western redcedar as an understory tree. Certain classes of understory grand fir saplings respond positively to release while others respond negatively (8,25). Pole-size and larger grand firs respond well to release by thinning and selection cuttings if the crowns are vigorous (13). Damaging Agents- During the period of stand development from establishment to maturity, several factors influence stand growth and yield. Grand fir is rated medium in fire resistance among species of the western white pine type; it is less resistant than thick-barked western larch, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir but more resistant than subalpine fir, western hemlock, and Engelmann spruce. Fire resistance is influenced by habitat. For example, in moist creek bottoms grand fir succumbs rapidly to ground fires, but on dry hillsides it is more resistant, largely because of its deeper root system and thicker bark. The needles are quite resistant to cold during the severest part of the winter. Grand fir leaves have been subjected to temperatures of -55° C (-67° F) without damage. Sudden extreme drops of temperature in the fall occasionally damage needles, but seldom are they fatal. Frost cracks and lightning scars appear more frequently on grand fir, however, than on its associates in the Inland Empire. The cracks cause little direct mortality but contribute to the spread of infection by decay fungi. Often small patches of trees are uprooted or broken by the accumulation of snow in the crowns of dense immature stands in the Inland Empire (9). In England young grand firs from Vancouver Island and western Washington are reportedly susceptible to late spring frost and drought crack (2). Susceptibility to heart rot and decay is one of the more important factors in the management of grand fir. Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorium) is the most destructive fungus in forests east of the Cascade crest (17). In the Blue Mountains of Oregon and Washington, decay was reported responsible for losses of 14 percent of the gross merchantable cubic-foot volume and 33 percent of the board-foot volume in sawtimber-size grand fir trees (1). Fungi enter the tree through small shade-killed branchlets in the lower crown. After closure of the branchlet stub, infections become dormant. Years later the infections are reactivated when mechanical injuries allow air to enter the heartwood where the dormant infections are located (7). Therefore, centers of decay are closely related to logging scars, frost cracks, broken tops, and other mechanical injuries (21). Indian paint fungus is rare in grand fir west of the Cascade crest where rapid growth rates close branch stubs quickly (7). Armillaria spp.and Phellinus weiri are the two most important root rot fungi. Poria subacida and Heterobasidion annosum also attack grand fir (17). Numerous insects attack grand fir. The western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) and Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata) have caused widespread defoliation, top kill, and mortality. The western balsam bark beetle (Dryocoetes confusus) and the fir engraver (Scolytus ventralis) are the principal bark beetles attacking grand fir. The fir cone moth (Barbara spp.), fir cone maggots (Earomyia spp.), and several seed chalcids destroy large numbers of grand fir cones and seeds. The balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae), often called ""gout disease of fir,"" has destroyed grand fir in western Oregon and Washington and is a serious threat in southwestern British Columbia (12).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,14,1
"Grand fir seems to grow equally well on soils derived from a variety of parent materials, including sandstone, weathered lava (rock), or granite and gneiss. In the Pacific coast region and in the Willamette Valley of Oregon it grows most abundantly on deep, rich alluvial soils along streams and valley bottoms and on moist soils provided with seepage. In the inland regions it grows best on rich mineral soils of the valley bottoms, but it also grows well on shallow, exposed soils of mountain ridges and pure pumice soils in central and eastern Oregon, provided moisture is adequate (9). Most of the soils that support grand fir have been classified as Spodosols. Grand fir grows on Vancouver Island and the adjacent mainland of British Columbia at elevations between sea level and 305 m (1,000 ft). In the southern interior of British Columbia it grows only in the moist valleys of such rivers as the Kootenay, Columbia, and Okanogan and their tributaries. Grand fir is predominantly a lowland species in western Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. In western Washington it grows in valleys and stream bottoms having high ground-water levels. Elevations of these sites are usually between 180 and 305 m (590 and 1,000 ft). At elevations above 460 m (1,510 ft), grand fir is replaced by Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis). Grand fir is found in western Oregon and in the lowlands of all the river regions, and in the lower west Cascades to an elevation of 915 m (3,000 ft). In northern California it grows from near sea level to about 1525 m (5,000 ft) (9). In the eastern Cascades of Washington, 915 to 1220 m (3,000 to 4,000 ft) is the upper altitude limit for grand fir, while in the eastern Cascades of Oregon it grows at 1525 m (5,000 ft). In the Inland Empire, including the Blue Mountains of Oregon, it is found as high as 1830 m (6,000 ft) and as low as 460 m (1,500 ft), but usually between 610 and 1525 m (2,000 and 5,000 ft). In the Nez Perce region of central Idaho, it grows well at altitudes of 1220 to 1675 m (4,000 to 5,500 ft) (9).",Soils and Topography,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,15,1
"The soft white wood of grand fir is a valued source of pulpwood. The wood also is commercially valuable as timber even though it is weaker and more prone to decay than many other species. The luxuriant foliage, symmetry, and deep green shiny color make grand fir one of the preferred species of Christmas trees grown in the Northwest. The attractive appearance of grand fir makes it valuable in recreation areas and urban plantings.",Special Uses,Grand Fir,abies,grandis,conifer,16,1

"Attempts have been made to artificially cross green ash with other ash species. Only the cross of green ash with velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina) was consistently successful, yielded viable seed, and produced identifiable hybrids that grew as fast as the eastern parent. The other crosses yielded no identifiable hybrids. The pumpkin ash (Fraxinus profunda) is a rare hexaploid (2n = 138 chromosomes) species of the Coastal Plain and Mississippi Valley (25). Its leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruit are larger than those of green ash or white ash but qualitatively similar to one or the other of these two species. The patterns of morphological variation and geographic distribution taken together are strong evidence for the view that pumpkin ash is a true-breeding polyploid derivative of a cross between a diploid green ash and tetraploid white ash.",Hybrids,Green Ash,fraxinus,pennsylvanica,hardwood,9,0

"Green ash is composed of three or more geographic ecotypes. The trees belonging to these ecotypes are easily distinguishable when growing under uniform conditions in a nursery but not when growing naturally. For that reason, they have not been given Latin varietal or subspecific names. Three different ecotypes were evident in the Great Plains (25). The population from the arid, northwestern part of the green ash range was more drought resistant than that from the more moist central Great Plains. As compared with the Coastal Plain ecotype, the Northern States ecotype grew more slowly, had greener petioles, was more winter hardy, and was less subject to leaf damage by fall frosts. These ecotypes may or may not be identical with those from the Eastern United States.",Population Differences,Green Ash,fraxinus,pennsylvanica,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Green ash is dioecious. The small, usually inconspicuous flowers appear in the spring, with or just before the leaves, in terminal or axillary clusters (4). Flowers are generally borne over the entire outer part of the live crown. Usually, flowering starts when trees are 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) d.b.h. and 6 to 8 in (20 to 25 ft) tall. A high percentage of the male and female trees bear flowers annually, and many female trees bear fruit each year. Flowers may appear as early as March or April in Florida and from late April to early May in the northern part of its range (25). Male flowers require 1 to 2 weeks to pass from the enlarged winter condition to completion of pollen shedding. Individual trees shed pollen over an interval of 3 to 4 days. Within a stand, range among individual trees in onset of pollen shedding is only 2 to 3 days. The pollen is disseminated by wind and is dispersed relatively short distances, most of it falling within 61 to 91 in (200 to 300 ft) of the source. Flower bud enlargement starts a few days later on female trees than on male (25). The stigmas of the female flowers are receptive as soon as they emerge from the bud and remain receptive for about a week. Receptivity appears to end just before the stigmas start to wither. The female flowers and young fruit are very sensitive to late spring frosts. Within a month after pollination, the samaras developing from fertilized flowers reach mature size. Ash fruits are elongated, winged, single-seeded samaras borne in clusters. Unpollinated flowers or flowers pollinated by an incompatible ash species drop off within the first month. Growth and ripening of embryos lag behind growth of samaras and are not completed until late September or early October. Physiological maturity of green ash seeds can be related to a fully elongated embryo that fills the entire embryonic cavity. When ripe, the embryo should be about 10 min (0.4 in) long and slightly less than I mm (0.04 in) in diameter. Mature embryos have firm, white tissues that break crisply. Physical characteristics indicating seed maturity can be utilized by workers in the field during seed collections (3). Color change in the samaras, from green to yellow or brown, is not complete until after the embryo is fully grown. Samples picked in mid-October in central Mississippi gave excellent germination though samaras were still slightly green. While samaras are still green, they may contain as much as 50-percent moisture, and care must be taken to prevent seed lots from overheating. A little heat damage at this stage may significantly reduce seed quality, especially if long-term storage is contemplated. In seed collections, especially bulk collections, complete change of samaras to a brown color probably is a safer index to maturity than size of the embryo. Seed Production and Dissemination- Green ash seeds start to fall as soon as they ripen and continue to fall into the winter (25). Most seeds are dispersed by wind within short distances of the parent tree. Some dispersal by water also may occur, but the importance of water as a long-distance dispersal agent is unknown. Seed clusters can be collected from trees by hand or with pruners and seed hooks. Fully dried samaras also may be shaken or whipped from limbs of standing trees onto plastic sheets spread under the trees. Fruit should be spread in shallow layers for complete drying, especially when collected early. Dried clusters may be broken apart by hand, by flailing in sacks, or by processing through a macerator. Seeds should be dried to 7- to 10-percent moisture content for storage. No loss in viability for 7 years was found when green ash seeds were stored in sealed containers at 5° C (41° F) with a seed moisture content of 7 to 10 percent. The epigeal germination may occur in the spring following seedfall, or seeds may lie dormant in the litter for several years before germinating. Dormancy is apparently due to both internal factors and to seedcoat effects (3,4). For the nursery, dormancy may be overcome by cold, moist stratification in a suitable medium, or simply storing in containers of water. Both methods should be used at temperatures of 2° to 4° C (35° to 40° F) for 90 to 120 days. Seeds may be sown in fall and allowed to stratify in the nursery bed. Seeds should be sown in nursery beds at approximately 80 to 100/m (25 to 30/ft) of row with rows 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) apart (25) and covered with burlap or greenhouse shade cloth until germination starts. Seedbed densities of 110 to 130/m² 10 to 12/ft² ) are recommended for green ash to produce high-quality seedlings. Seedling Development- Under good nursery conditions in the northern part of its range, seedlings grow about 30 cm (12 in) in height the first year and another 46 cm (18 in) the second year. In the southern part of the green ash range, nurseries can produce seedlings 0.8 to 0.9 m (2.5 to 3.0 ft) tall the first growing season. Uninjured nursery seedlings usually develop no side branches during the first year. On vigorous seedlings, the uppermost one or two pairs of lateral buds develop into branches during the second year. Apical dominance usually is strong enough in vigorous, uninjured open-grown trees so that they often have a single, straight stem until they are 5 m (15 ft) or more tall. If this dominance is lost by the removal of a terminal bud, the uppermost lateral branch quickly takes over and reasserts dominance over the lower branches (25). In slow-growing shaded specimens, the tendency for quick assertion of apical dominance following deer nipping or other damage to a terminal bud is much less pronounced. As a consequence, understory seedlings frequently have poor form. Vegetative Reproduction- Stumps of sapling and pole-size green ash sprout readily. Studies in Mississippi have shown ash, as sprouts, to be one of the dominant species in bottom-land clearings (11,13). Dominants among the ash sprouts were 3.8 cm (1.5 in) d.b.h. and 5 m (15 ft) tall after five growing seasons. Cuttings made from 1-0 seedlings or 1-year-old sprouts root easily under greenhouse and field conditions (25). Cuttings may be planted horizontally under the soil or vertically with good results(14,15). However, no practical way to root cuttings from older trees has yet been found. Green ash can be successfully bench-grafted or field-grafted (2,18). Understocks; can be stored by severely root-pruning young seedlings and heeling them in by groups of 50 to 100. Most of the seedlings remain alive but grow so little that they supply an assortment of small understocks whenever needed.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Green Ash,fraxinus,pennsylvanica,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- In shelterbelts in the Great Plains, green ash averaged 0.4 m (1.3 ft) per year height growth for the first 6.5 years (25). Opengrown trees planted on a fertile soil in Pennsylvania grew 14 to 17 m (45 to 55 ft) tall and 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in) in d.b.h in 21 years. In most areas in the northern part of its range, green ash reaches heights of 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft) and breast-high diameters of 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in). On good sites in the southern part of its range, trees attain a height up to 37 m (120 ft) and a d.b.h. of 61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 in) (20). Diameter growth of dominant crop trees in well-stocked, managed stands is about 6 to 8 cm (2.5 to 3.0 in) in 10 years (5). Little data exist on growth rates and volumes of trees grown under natural stand conditions. Probably the best information available is contained in results of research conducted in Georgia (6). Four sites included in the study ranged from well-drained sandy loams on levees or terraces to poorly drained, wet, silty flats. Green ash was the dominant species in these stands, comprising about 80 percent of the total stand basal area. Stand ages ranged from 27 to 65 years. Average stand heights for green ash sawtimber ranged from 24 m (78 ft) in the 27-year-old stand to 35 m (116 ft) in the 65-year-old stand. Volume growth ranged from 2.7 to 4.6 m³/ha (39 to 65 ft³/acre) per year. Growth was related to stand age with better growth rates occurring in the younger stands. Merchantable sawtimber volume ranged from 104.4 m³/ha (1,491 ft³/acre) in the 27-year-old stand to 175.8 m³/ha (2,511 ft³/acre) in the 65-yearold stand. In addition to sawtimber, pulpwood volumes from tops and small trees ranged from 144.8 m³/ha (23 cords/acre) in the younger stand to 245.6 m³/ha (39 cords/acre) in the older stand. Green ash on most sites in the southern part of its range is characterized by a clear, straight bole for about half the total height (6). Above this point the stem often forks or crooks and has large branches that degrade the lumber. Merchantable height for saw logs averages about two 5-m (16-ft) logs. Merchantable height for pulpwood to a 10-cm (4-in) top may extend to 12 m (40 ft) in younger stands. Its pioneer nature and ability to grow rapidly in relatively pure, even-aged stands indicate green ash is well suited for plantation management. Studies in Mississippi and Arkansas have shown that green ash grows about 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) in height and 13 mm. (0.5 in) in d.b.h. the first 5 to 10 years under plantation management (fig. 4). Natural stands appear to support sufficient volume to allow commercial thinnings at 25 to 30 years (6). To ensure reasonable volume production and reduce epicormic branching in the residual stand, basal area should not be reduced below 23.0 to 27.6 m²/ha (100 to 120 ft²/acre). This should be represented by about 250 to 300 trees/ha (100 to 120 trees/acre). Rooting Habit- Root systems were studied in North Dakota on a Fargo clay soil, with a 0.3-m (1-ft) layer of black surface soil overlaying a light-colored, calcareous, clayey soil with no hardpan (25). The soil was poorly drained and wet in the spring; later in the growing season the water table was at a depth of about 5 in (15 ft) or more. Roots had extended laterally for 15 in (48 ft) and 1.1 in (3.6 ft) downward; they were about equally distributed in the upper 0.9 in (3 ft) of soil. Excavations of other root systems have shown green ash roots to penetrate about 1 in (3.2 ft) deep in sandy and clay soils and 1.4 in (4.5 ft) deep along the edges of sloughs. In the southern part of its range, green ash has a root system that is typically saucer-shaped with no distinct taproot; roots penetrate to depths of 0.9 to 1.2 in (3 to 4 ft). The extensive root system of this species makes it relatively windfirm. Green ash seedlings, and probably older trees, have certain rooting habits or adaptations that enable them to withstand flooding (1,16,21). Young green ash (8) has been shown to have the ability under flooded conditions to regenerate new secondary roots from the primary root, develop adventitious water roots on the submerged stem, accelerate anaerobic respiration rate in the absence of oxygen, and oxidize its rhizospheres. These root adaptations enable it to withstand flooding regimes of several months during the dormant and early growing season that would kill other species (9,10,25). Specific gravity has been shown to be related to flooding in some hardwoods (19). Reaction to Competition- Green ash varies from intolerant to moderately tolerant to shade in the northern part of its range. It comes in early in succession on alluvial soils, either as a pioneer species or following cottonwood, quaking aspen, or black willow (25). It is less able to maintain its position in the crown canopy than some of its more rapidly growing associates such as red maple and American elm. In the southern part of its range, green ash would be considered tolerant when young and moderately tolerant as it grows older. Studies have shown that advanced reproduction of green ash can be maintained in the understory for more than 15 years (12). Green ash may not grow more than 15 cm (6 in) in height yearly, with 12- to 15-year-old trees being 4 to 5 in (12 to 15 ft) tall and 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. However, these trees respond well to release and outgrow many of their competitors (13). Other studies of green ash in plantations, where various levels of cultural treatments were applied, showed that green ash could tolerate competition from weeds and vines better than any of the 6 to 10 other species tested (17). Overall, green ash may most accurately be classed as tolerant of shade. Damaging Agents- Many insects feed at least occasionally on green ash. One of the most serious is the oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes u1mi), which is distributed throughout the Northeast and can cause serious damage among seedlings and small trees. The carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae) bores into the heartwood of large branches and trunks, permitting the entrance of fungi. The brownheaded ash sawfly (Tomostethus multicinctus) and the blackheaded ash sawfly (Tethida barda) occasionally cause serious damage to shade trees. The ash borer (Podosesia syringae) damages the stems of trees of all sizes, causing lumber degrade in timber-sized trees and contributing to decline and mortality in shelterbelt plantings (23,25). Several diseases are of general importance. The fungus Mycosphaerella fraxinicola creates a leaf spot which may cause premature defoliation of young trees. Anthracnose (Gloeosporium aridum) also causes premature defoliation. A rust caused by Puccinia peridermiopora results in distortion of petioles and small twigs. Several rots cause minor damage in green ash. In Texas and Oklahoma, green ash has shown intermediate susceptibility to a root rot caused by Phymatotrichum omnivorum (25). Young trees are subject to damage from deer browsing, and rabbits may sever the stems.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Green Ash,fraxinus,pennsylvanica,hardwood,14,0
"Like most trees, green ash grows best on fertile, moist, well-drained soils. It is probably the most adaptable of all the ashes, growing naturally on a range of sites from clay soils subject to frequent flooding and overflow to sandy or silty soils where the amount of available moisture may be limited (24). Natural stands of green ash are almost completely confined to bottom lands, but the species grows well when planted on moist upland soils. It thrives when planted on medium- to coarse-textured upland sands and loams from North Dakota to Texas where soils had good moisture and neutral to alkaline reactions. Green ash most commonly is found on alluvial soils along rivers and streams and less frequently in swamps (25). It lines the watercourses in the western parts of its range where rainfall is insufficient to support upland growth. It is common on land subject to flooding and can remain healthy when flooded for as long as 40 percent of the time during a growing season. Green ash grows on soils most common to the orders Inceptisols and Entisols. In fertilizer experiments, green ash was tolerant of soil alkalinity but showed severe chlorosis when grown on a soil with a pH of 8.1 (25). Culture-species tests on a riverfront site in Mississippi have shown that ash grew well on a silt-loam soil with a pH ranging between 7.5 and 8.0. Other studies have shown the importance of soil characteristics to tree growth. Growth was much better on soils that had not been cultivated than on ones that had been in cultivation (7). The longer an area had been in cultivation or the more severely eroded the A horizon, the poorer the growth of green ash. Forest sites support better growth than old field sites, probably because of suitable mycorrhizae and organic matter in the forest soils. Green ash has been planted on spoil banks resulting from strip-mining (25). These soils usually are highly acidic. Survival generally has been high, but annual growth rates of only about 0.3 m (1 ft) have been reported.

"Green ash wood, because of its strength, hardness, high shock resistance, and excellent bending qualities, is used in specialty items such as tool handles and baseball bats but is not as desirable as white ash. It is also being widely used in revegetation of spoil banks created from strip mining (25). Green ash is very popular as a shade tree in residential areas because of its good form, adaptability to a wide range of sites, and relative freedom from insects and diseases.

"Hackberry is seldom found in pure stands in the forest. It is prominent, however, in the northern phase of the forest cover type Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Society of American Foresters Type 93) where it replaces sugarberry (4). Hackberry is a common associate in limited portions of three other forest cover types: Sugar Maple-Basswood (Type 26) in the Central Hardwood Region, Beech-Sugar Maple (Type 60) throughout the Midwest, and Sycamore-Sweetgum-American Elm (Type 94) in the Northern Mississippi Valley.",Associated Forest Cover,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,1,0
"The wide distribution of hackberry is evidence that this species can withstand a variety of climatic conditions (6). Annual precipitation in its growing area ranges from 360 mm (14 in) in the Great Plains to 1520 mm (60 in) in the southeastern United States, and distribution and kind of precipitation differ greatly by seasons. Hackberry is subjected to great extremes of temperature in the Great Plains where an annual variation of 60° C (140° F) or more is common, but variations are more moderate in the Southeast. The length of frost-free season ranges from 120 to 250 days within its growing area. Hackberry is drought resistant and has survived extremely dry periods in the Great Plains. During the severe drought of 1934 in western Kansas, hackberry survived better than American elm (Ulmus americana) and honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos), to the same degree as boxelder (Acer negundo) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), but not as well as bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana).",Climate,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,2,0
"Because hackberry grows in a region with great climatic differences, genetic variation probably exists; however, provenance tests have just begun in the Great Plains area. Although no hybrids have been reported, it has been noted that Celtis occidentalis and C. laevigata are self-compatible and therefore capable of hybridizing (2).",Genetics,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,7,0
"Hackberry is widely distributed in the eastern United States from the southern New England States through central New York west in southern Ontario to North and South Dakota. Northern outliers are found in southern Quebec, western Ontario, southern Manitoba, and southeastern Wyoming. The range extends south from western Nebraska to northeastern Colorado and northwestern Texas, then east to Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina, with scattered occurrences in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia (7). Because sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) and hackberry are so similar, it has been difficult to establish the exact range of either species in the South. Parts of their ranges overlap, with hackberry probably restricted to the upland and sugarberry occupying the bottom land. -The native range of hackberry.",Native Range,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Seed Production- Hackberry is polygamo-monoecious. The small greenish flowers (1) appear with or shortly after the leaves in early April in the southern part of the range and in late May in the northern part. The seed ripens in September and October, sometimes remaining on the tree until the following spring. The fruit (a spherical drupe) is usually from 6 to 8 mm (0.25 to 0.33 in) in diameter and dark red to purple when ripe. A thin pulp encloses a single bony nutlet. Hackberry bears good seed crops in most years and light seed crops on intervening years. The seed is disseminated principally by birds and small mammals, but some may be dispersed by water. In an Indiana study, 34 percent of the hackberry seed stored 1 year in the leaf litter germinated and 20 percent of the seed germinated after being stored 2 winters (3). Seed Production and Dissemination- No information available. Seedling Development- Germination of hackberry is epigeal (1). In eastern Iowa, hackberry seedlings become established in existing hardwood stands but rarely in old fields. In Illinois, however, the tree has become established in prairie conditions. In Pennsylvania, hackberry seedlings were found in dense shade where seedlings of the other overstory trees did not persist. On an Indiana floodplain, however, hackberry was the only tree of the principal crown cover that had a high rate of mortality among its seedlings. Early growth of hackberry varies greatly within its range and even on different sites in a single locality. Although height growth may not exceed 2.5 cm (1 in) per year under a dense overstory, cultivated hackberry planted in the Great Plains shelterbelts averaged 0.4 in (1.3 ft) per year during the first 6 years (6). Vegetative Reproduction- Hackberry can be propagated by stem cuttings, grafting, budding, and by layering. Sprouts develop from stumps of small trees but rarely from those of large ones.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- On the better alluvial soils, diameter growth of hackberry may be as much as 8 mm (0.3 in) annually, although usually it is much less. In the western part of its range, an annual diameter growth of 5 mm (0.2 in) has been observed. Usually growth is most rapid between the 20th and 40th years. On poor sites, growth is very slow and the trees are often dwarfed. Mature hackberry is usually a small to medium-sized tree from 9 to 15 in (30 to 50 ft) tall and from 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) in d.b.h. (6). On the best sites, however, it may reach a height of 40 rn (130 ft) and a d.b.h. of 122 cm (48 in). Trees up to 29 m (95 ft) tall and 122 cm (48 in) in d.b.h. have been found in the western part of the range. Maximum age attained by hackberry is probably between 150 and 200 years. Rooting Habit- Hackberry is a deep rooting species, ultimately reaching depths between 3 and 6 m (10 and 20 ft) on most sites (8). On clay prairie soil in North Dakota, however, the roots reached only to a depth of 1.4 m (4.5 ft); lateral extension was 12.6 m (41.5 ft). Strong taproots develop only occasionally. The root anatomy of the genus Celtis is unique, along with a few other genera, in that a primary structure of the root phloem is stereome (sclerenchyma and collenchyma collectively). Stereome seldom develops in roots and when present is usually a secondary structure. The mycorrhizal associates of hackberry are the ectomycorrhizae (8). Mature hackberry is classified as moderately tolerant of flooding. New seedlings are much more sensitive to saturated soil conditions than older trees. The root systems of hackberry seedlings in saturated soil are severely injured within 60 days and are often unable to recover. Intolerance of flooding is attributed to injury to the root system, lack of strong adventitious roots, and the inability of the stems and leaves to resist desiccation due to a poorly or non-functioning root system. Reaction to Competition- Hackberry is intermediate to tolerant in its ability to withstand shade (6). Trees suppressed for an extended period are often poorly formed. Because hackberry is found in many forest types ranging from temporary to subclimax, its successional position is difficult to determine. Where it occasionally grows in small, nearly pure stands, it is probably only a temporary type. Damaging Agents- Hackberry is the host of four gall-producing insects-Pachypsylla celtidisgemma, P. celtidismamma, P. celtidisuesicula, and P. venusta. The adults pass the winter in cracks of the bark or among the debris on the ground and in spring lay eggs on the leaves. The damage is not serious. The hackberry engraver (Scolytus muticus) normally attacks only dead or dying branches but has been reported to attack the living sapwood thus killing the tree. Several leaf-spot fungi are common on hackberry trees-Cercospora spegazzinii, Cylindrosporium defoliatum, Cerosporellaceltidis, Mycosphaerella maculiformis, Phleosporaceltidis, Phyllosticta celtidis, and Septogloeumceltidis. The most important disease is ""witches-broom,"" which causes a rosette-like proliferation of the branch tips and is caused by two agents, one the gall mite Eriophyes spp. and the other a powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca phytophila) (5). Hackberry is highly susceptible to fire damage, which opens the way for wood decay organisms. Armillaria mellea grows unaggressively on hackberry roots until they die or are injured, whereupon the fungus enters and causes extensive root rot.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,14,0
"Hackberry grows in many soils, and although principally a bottom-land tree, it is frequently found on limestone outcrops or limestone soils. In western Nebraska, hackberry grows on the north side of sand dunes and in river valleys. Sites with a permanently high water table are unfavorable for hackberry, although periodic flooding apparently is not detrimental. In Kentucky, 46 days of flooding during one growing season caused no apparent damage to this tree. Hackberry begins to show ill effects from inundation after 110 days. If the duration of flooding is less than 25 percent of the growing season, Celtis spp. can maintain good health indefinitely. Hackberry trees often survive the first season of permanent flooding but usually die during or after the second season (8). Occasional trees have lived 3 years under flooded conditions. In Illinois, continuous flooding to a depth of 91 cm (3 ft) killed hackberry in less than 4 years. Where only mud was present, 70 percent of the trees were dead at the end of 6 years. Submergence for short periods kills many seedlings. In Pennsylvania, the presence of hackberry has been regarded as an indicator of high (7.2) pH. Hackberry grows best on valley soils, but throughout much of its range it is also commonly found on slopes and bluffs. In the western part of its range, however, it is restricted to well-developed river valleys, north slopes, and protected ravines, and it is largely absent from windswept parts of the western river valleys. It is common in eastern Iowa on all but the wettest bottom-land sites, and seedling and sapling hackberry occur on upland sites under existing oak stands on all aspects, slopes, and ridges (6). The soils upon which hackberry grows fall primarily within the soil orders Mollisols, Entisols, and, to a lesser extent, Inceptisols.",Soils and Topography,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,15,0
"Hackberry seed is eaten by animals, and in Kansas the fox squirrel feeds on both the nipple galls and the fruit. The fruit is eaten also by quail, ring-necked pheasant, wild turkey, cedar waxwings, sharp-tailed grouse, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, mockingbirds, robins, and other birds. Good grades of hackberry wood are used for furniture, millwork, and some athletic equipment. Poor grades are used for crates and boxes.",Special Uses,Hackberry,celtis,occidentalis,hardwood,16,0
"Throughout its range, honeylocust generally occurs only as a minor component of natural forest stands. It is included in four forest cover types in the United States (19). It is an associated species on lowland sites in Bur Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 42), especially in the more southerly portions of the type range, and in Willow Oak-Water Oak-Diamondleaf Oak (Type 88). It is a minor associate in Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Type 92) and Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93). Mesophytic species commonly associated with honeylocust include red maple (Acer rubrum), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), pecan (Carya illinoensis), boxelder (Acer negundo), Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), black walnut (Juglans nigra), oaks (Quercus spp.), elms (Ulmus spp.), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), and hickories (Carya spp.).",Associated Forest Cover,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,1,0
"In the western portion of its range honeylocust grows in a subhumid climate while in the middle and eastern portions the climate is humid. Normal annual precipitation varies from about 510 mm (20 in) in South Dakota and Texas to more than 1520 mm (60 in) in southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Average annual snowfall varies from none to 102 cm (40 in). Length of the growing season varies from about 150 days in the north and northeast to more than 300 days in the southern extremities of the range. Honeylocust is tolerant of low temperatures and in the north it is hardy at -29° to -34° C (-20° to -30° F) (10). Northern races harden-off and become dormant relatively early, while growth of southern races continues later into the year. Southern races are subject to frost damage when planted in the north (7). Honeylocust also may suffer frost damage or dieback because of its indefinite or indeterminate annual growth pattern (4). Twigs may continue to elongate until stopped by cold, whereupon the tender terminal internodes are killed by the first frosts. New growth in the spring then comes from the lower lateral buds.",Climate,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,2,0
"The honeylocust has wide genetic variations that have enabled improvement through selection. The northern races show relatively good winter hardiness and southern races bear fruit that is much more nutritious for stock feeding than that found on the trees in the north (6). A number of horticultural forms have been developed and are widely cultivated, especially for shade and as ornamentals (24). Thornless honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos var. inermis Willd.) is thornless, or nearly so, and slender in habit; bushy honeylocust (G. triacanthos var. elegantissima [Grosdemangel Rehd.) is unarmed and densely bushy; Bujot honeylocust (G. triacanthos var. bujotii [Neuml Rehd.) has slender pendulous branches and narrow leaflets; and dwarf honeylocust (G. triacanthos var. nana [Loud.] A. Henry) is a small compact shrub or tree. Selected cultivars of the thornless forms have been patented. About 60 percent of the seedlings grown from thornless honeylocust seed are thornless (7). Gleditsia x texana Sarg., the Texas honeylocust, is considered to be a hybrid of G. aquatica Marsh. and G. triacanthos L. (24). Its range is largely restricted to the Brazos River bottoms in Texas, with additional trees found along the Red River in Louisiana and occasionally along the Mississippi River in Indiana and Mississippi.",Hybrids,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,9,0
"Honeylocust is found scattered in the East-Central United States from central Pennsylvania westward to southeastern South Dakota, south to central and southeastern Texas, east to southern Alabama, then northeasterly through Alabama to western Maryland. Outlying populations of the species may be found in northwestern Florida, west Texas, and west-central Oklahoma. It is naturalized east to the Appalachian Mountains from South Carolina north to Pennsylvania, New York, and New England (11). Honeylocust attains its maximum development in the valleys of small streams in southern Indiana and Illinois. -The native range of honey locust. Honeylocust, especially the thornless form, is widely cultivated as an ornamental and shade tree in all countries having a temperate climate.",Native Range,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowering occurs in late spring, the average date being about May 10 in the southern limit of the range and June 25 in the north (7). Honeylocust leaves are nearly full grown when the flowers are produced, which is usually late enough in the year for the seed crop to escape frost damage. The species is polygamo-dioecious; flowers are home in axillary, dense, green racemes (24). Racemes of staminate flowers are 5 to 13 em (2 to 5 in) long, pubescent, and often clustered. The calyx is campanulate, with five elliptic-lanceolate lobes; there are four to five petals, erect, oval, and longer than the calyx lobes; and up to 10 stamens, inserted on the calyx tube. The pistil is rudimentary or absent in the staminate flowers. Pistillate racemes are 5 to 8 ern (2 to 3 in) long, slender, with few flowers, and usually solitary. The pistils are tomentose, the ovary nearly sessile, and the style short; there may be two ovules or many. The stamens are much smaller and abortive in pistillate flowers. Seeds, borne in long (15 to 41 cm, 6 to 16in), flat, indehiscent, and often twisted pods, ripen about mid-September in the southern portion of the range and around mid-October in the north. Soon after fruits mature they begin falling and dissemination often continues into late winter. Seed Production and Dissemination- Honeylocust begins bearing seed at about 10 years of age, optimum production occurring between 25 and 75 years. Trees continue to bear fruit up to about 100 years of age (7). They generally bear fruit each year and produce abundant seed crops every year or two. Honeylocust seeds, like those of many leguminous species, have impermeable coats and thus remain viable for long periods of time. Under natural conditions, individual seeds become permeable at different periods following maturation so that any one crop is capable of producing seedlings over a period of several years. The seeding range or natural dispersal of honeylocust seeds is not extensive. The pods, however, are readily eaten by cattle, whereby seeds are scattered in the feces. Undoubtedly seeds are also disseminated by birds and other mammals that feed on the fruit. Cleaned seeds average about 6,170/kg (2,800/lb), with a commercial purity of 95 percent and a soundness of 98 percent (24). Viability can be retained for several years when seeds are stored in sealed containers at 0° to 7° C (32° to 45° F) (3). Seedling Development- Germination is thought to be enhanced when seeds are eaten and passed undigested by birds and mammals (7). Passage through the digestive system apparently softens the impermeable seedcoat. Enhanced germination can also be achieved by mechanically scarifying the seeds or soaking them in concentrated sulfuric acid or hot water (880 C, 1900 F) for 1 to 2 hours. When hot water is used the water and seeds should be allowed to cool to room temperature or until seeds swell (3). Treated seeds should be sown promptly and not stored. Germination is epigeal. Honeylocust seedlings show a growth pattern characteristic of deciduous hardwoods with sympodial. growth. Persistent terminal buds are not formed and the shoot tip often dies and falls off (5). Nursery-grown seedlings from pretreated seeds attain suitable size-30 cm (12 in) or more in height-for field planting in 1 year (3). In southern Michigan, first-year seedlings grown in pots reached a height of 37 cm (14.6 in) by September 21, just before leaf abscission (5). The average root-to-shoot ratio was 2 to 3. Stem growth was slow in the spring but rapid in early summer and fall. Only 60 percent of the height growth was attained by mid-July. In an additional study in southern Michigan, nursery seedlings grown 3 years in pots and nearly two growing seasons outplanted in the field averaged 22 mm (0.9 in) in trunk diameter (16) by early autumn. The following year trunk diameter increased 4 min (0.15 in). Dormant nursery-grown seedlings can be stored, barerooted, at about 0° C (32° F) for several weeks before outplanting with no appreciable loss in survival rate (15). Vegetative Reproduction- Honeylocust coppices freely. Propagation, particularly of high quality clonal stock, can be achieved by grafting, budding, and cuttings from hardwood, softwood, and roots (7). Root cuttings appear to be the best method of reproducing desirable strains in large quantities at reasonable cost. At times other species or varieties are grafted onto the rootstock of honeylocust (24). Honeylocust thorn production usually diminishes gradually and finally ceases in the upper and outer crown growth as the tree ages. Thorns may still be produced on the lower trunk and on lower-trunk and limb sprouts. Typical trees, 10 years old or more, show a definite thornless region in the upper and outer shoot growth. When hardwood cuttings for propagation are taken from this thornless area, the scions generally remain thornless (6). Tree breeders can control the sex of scions from honeylocust by selecting unisexual budwood when taking cuttings. Certain branches bear only one type of flower, and trees from cuttings from those branches will bear only that type (14).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- In natural stands honeylocust attains a height of 21 to 24 m (70 to 80 ft) and a d.b.h. of 61 to 91 cm. (24 to 36 in). On the best sites, trees may be 43 m (140 ft) in height and 152 to 183 cm (60 to 72 in) in d.b.h. On poor sites trees are stunted, wide-branched, and often covered with thorns. In eastern Nebraska, 18- to 35year-old honeylocust in plantations grew an average of 4.6 cm (1.8 in) in diameter each 10 years. The average height growth of honeylocust planted in shelterbelts from North Dakota to Texas was 49 cm (19.2 in) per year during the first 7 years (7). This was a slower height growth than for plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides var. occidentalis) and Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) but faster than that of American elm (U. americana), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), or hackberry (Celtis laevigata), all of which were frequently planted on the same shelterbelt projects. Under favorable conditions the annual diameter growth of young honeylocust is from 8 to 13 mm (0.33 to 0.50 in) (22). The species is an excellent tree for windbreaks. Rooting Habit- Honeylocust is deep rooted with a widely spreading and profusely branched root system and a strong taproot. Deep soils are penetrated as far as 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft). The root system is responsive to environmental conditions. For example, in a Missouri study, 4- to 6-year-old saplings on upland clay soil produced root systems that were about twice as long, with laterals covering twice the area, as those of older trees growing in lowland alluvial soil where the water table was higher (7). The generalized, well-developed root system enables this species to grow on both upland and lowland sites. Reaction to Competition- Honeylocust is classed as intolerant of shade, and reproduction becomes established only beneath openings in the forest canopy (5). Both top and root growth are retarded where young trees are subjected to shade; therefore, for survival and optimum development, honeylocust must maintain a dominant position in the forest community. Lower limbs of forest-grown trees die when they are excessively shaded from the sides, and the dead limbs often are retained for some time. Honeylocust is occasionally a pioneer on midwest strip-mine spoil banks. It is also a pioneer in rocky limestone glades of Tennessee and Kentucky, where it is often succeeded by eastern redcedar (Juniperus uirginiana). In northern Ohio, honeylocust was found with shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa) and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) in the elm-ash-soft maple association on areas that formerly were swampy (7). Damaging Agents- With the increased popularity and plantings of honeylocust, particularly the cultivars of thornless varieties, there has been a corresponding increase in the kinds and numbers of attacking insects. Generally, insect attacks are not fatal but they do weaken the tree and retard growth. Honeylocust is a host of a number of leaf feeders and severe infestations can rapidly defoliate trees. A severe and widely distributed defoliator is the mimosa webworm (Homadaula anisocentra) (1). The search for webworm resistant trees has not been productive (17). Eotetranychus multidigituli, a spider mite common to the midwest, and other mites feed on honeylocust leaves. Heavy infestations, occurring particularly in hot dry weather, will defoliate a tree. The whitemarked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), the honeylocust plant bug (Diaphnocoris chlorionis) (25), the leaf hopper (Empoasca pergandei), and several other species of pod galls, leaf rollers, leaf hoppers, moths, loopers, bagworms, and beetles feed on honeylocust foliage. The walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata) is also included among the many defoliators (21). Agrilus difficilis, a flatheaded borer, important west of the Mississippi River, burrows beneath the bark and may eventually girdle the trunk or large limbs (18). Several other bark and wood borers attack honeylocust, such as the widely distributed Xyleborus saxeseni. A number of scale insects, such as the European fruit lecanium (Parthenolecanium corni), which is widespread and particularly damaging to shade trees, and the cottony maple scale (Pulvinaria innumerabilis), injure the bark of honeylocust, especially on small branches, lowering the vitality and growth rate of trees (18). Weakened trees become subject to attack and further damage by various species of boring insects and bark beetles. The twig girdler, Oncideres cingulata, prunes small branches and can inflict severe injury on nursery seedlings. Heavy infestations can also severely damage large trees. The larvae of Amblycerus robiniae, a bruchid weevil, feed on honeylocust seed (1). The female periodical cicada (Magicicada septendecim) can damage honeylocust, especially young transplanted trees, by depositing eggs in the twigs. Honeylocust is subject to few diseases, none of which interfere with its growth, except in isolated situations. The most noteworthy disease is the canker Thyronectria austro-americana, which can be fatal. Spiculosa cankers cause loss in merchantable wood volume or cull. Honeylocust is subject to several heart-rot and wood-decay fungi from species of Fomes and Polyporus. Few leaf diseases attack honeylocust, and none mar the tree. The most widely distributed is tarry leaf spot caused by Linospora gleditsiae (9). In the seedling stage honeylocust is susceptible to cotton root rot (Phymatotrichum omnivorum), which is sometimes fatal (7). In shelterbelt planting tests in Oklahoma and Texas it was ranked as highly susceptible to certain Phymatotrichum root rots (27). Two other root diseases, Ganoderma lucidum and G. curtisii, can cause extensive root rot and tree fatality. The incidence of these root rots is not high. In the southeast Texas area honeylocust was visibly damaged but not killed by air pollution, presumed to be mainly sulfur dioxide. In Illinois the species was ranked as highly resistant to ice damage and in Tennessee it was rated about average in resistance to flooding damage (9). It also appears to be resistant to salt spray when planted near the coast. Honeylocust is considered to be windfirm, but heavy limb breakage from wind was reported in Kansas. Because of its relatively thin bark it is easily damaged by fire (7). Rabbits sometimes inflict damage by gnawing the bark from young trees during the winter.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,14,0
"Honeylocust is found most commonly on soils in the orders Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Mollisols that originate from limestone or the rich alluvial floodplains of major rivers and streams. Growth is poor on gravelly or heavy clay soils and honeylocust often fails on shallow soils. Although ample soil moisture is necessary for best growth, the species is very resistant to drought. Because of this, it is a valuable species for shelterbelt planting in the Great Plains. On 20 drought-resistant species of seedlings tested, honeylocust ranked third in alkali tolerance (7). The species is also tolerant of acid soils (26), but best development is usually on soils having a pH between 6.0 and 8.0. From tests incorporating artificially salinized soils, young honeylocusts were found to be tolerant of soil salinity (13). Seed germination was little influenced by as much as 0.20 percent of sodium chloride in the dry weight of soil (2). Salt tolerance has particular economic importance in the North where runoff from highway de-icing salts can damage plantings, and also where plantings are desired on saline soils in and states. Whether honeylocust can tolerate the cumulative effects of salinity over a period of years is still unknown. Typically, honeylocust is a bottom land species, most commonly found only on moist fertile soils near streams or lakes. Although it is not common anywhere in the Mississippi River Delta, it frequently grows on low clay ridges and flats in first bottoms and on the secondary flood plains along the Missouri River tributaries in Nebraska. Over its range honeylocust grows naturally below a maximum elevation of 610 to 760 m (2,000 to 2,500 ft), although the general upper elevational. limit for the species is reported as 1520 m (5,000 ft). A 20year-old plantation growing at 2100 m (6,900 ft) in Colorado had ""good"" survival, but trees averaged only 2.4 m (8 ft) in height (7).",Soils and Topography,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,15,0
"Honeylocust fruits are readily eaten by cattle and hogs. The beans of some cultivars contain as much as 12 to 13 percent protein, and the pods contain up to 42 percent carbohydrates (12,20). Livestock also eat the young vegetative growth and both the fruit and plants are eaten by snowshoe hares and cottontails. Fruits are also eaten by gray squirrels, fox squirrels, white-tailed deer, bobwhite, starlings, crows, and opossum (7,8). Honeylocust is a source of honey during the short flowering period in spring. Both the common honeylocust and its thornless varieties are planted for erosion control and for wind breaks; the thornless varieties are widely planted as shade and ornamental trees. In many urban areas thornless honeylocust has been planted as a replacement for the American elm (26). The wood of honeylocust possesses many desirable qualities but is little used because of its scarcity (23). The sapwood is generally wide and yellowish in contrast to the reddish-brown heartwood, providing an attractive grain. The wood is dense, very heavy, very hard, strong in bending, stiff, resistant to shock, and is durable when in contact with soil. It is used locally for fence posts, and also as lumber for pallets, crating, and general construction.",Special Uses,Honeylocust,gleditsia,triacanthos,hardwood,16,0
"Rarely found in pure stands, incense-cedar grows in several forest cover types where it occupies a subdominant crown position. Except in Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Society of American Foresters Type 243) (5) where its stocking may account for half of the stems in a stand (20,26), incense-cedar is a minor component of the cover types in which it is found. These cover types include Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244), California Black Oak (Type 246), Jeffrey Pine (Type 247), and Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245).

In the southern part, common associates are Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, sugar pine, Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa), and California black oak. Tree associates on ultramafic soils include Jeffrey pine, western white pine, sugar pine, knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata), and coast Douglas-fir. Common brush species growing with incense-cedar are greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus), deerbrush (C. integerrimus), snowbrush (C. velutinus), littleleaf ceanothus (C. parvifolius), bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), bush chinkapin (Castanopsis sempervirens), salal (Gaultheria shallon), and coast rhododendron (Rhododendron californicum) (22). On ultramafic soils, sclerophyllous shrubs predominate and include barberry (Berberis pumila), silk-tassel (Garrya buxifolia), tanoak, huckleberry oak Quercus vaccinifolia), coffeeberry (Rhamnus californica), western azalea (Rhododendron occidentale), and red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium) (32).",Associated Forest Cover,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,1,1
"Incense-cedar's natural range is characterized by dry summers, usually with less than 25 mm (1 in) precipitation per month; annual temperature extremes are -34° to 48° C (-30° to 118° F). Annual precipitation, part of which is snow, varies from 510 to 2030 mm (20 to 80 in). Precipitation may be as low as 380 mm (15 in) a year for incense-cedar found on the east side of the Cascades and in the Warner Mountains in Oregon and California (22).",Climate,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,2,1
"A few horticultural varieties are recognized. In southern California, especially in southwestern San Bernardino County, trees with conspicuously narrower crowns and more spire-like silhouettes than those of the Sierra Nevada are common. European experience with incense-cedar as an ornamental suggests that the columnar trees from southern California may be more sensitive to cold than are the trees from northerly sources (11). The genetic structure of incense-cedar was studied in stands that occupy different elevations and aspects within each of three locations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada (8). Genetic variation was assessed using two approaches: measuring characteristics of seedling growth and estimating allele and genotypic frequencies. Conclusions were similar for both approaches. Genetic diversity was as great among local stands as among regions, and no consistent pattern could be related to elevational or aspect differences. Growth in height and branch length was less for southern sources. Striking differences among provenances, however, like those found for Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and white fir, were not apparent. No hybrids of incense-cedar are known.",Genetics,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,7,1
"Incense-cedar is a distinctive component of the Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest, where it grows as scattered individuals or in small groups (5). Its range spans about 15° of latitude and a variety of climates from the southern slope of Mount Hood in Oregon, southward through the Siskiyou, Klamath, and Warner Mountains, Cascade and Coast Ranges, and Sierra Nevada to the dry Hanson Laguna and Sierra de San Pedro Martir Ranges in Baja California (7). Incense-cedar grows from the coastal fog belt eastward to the desert fringes. It can be found in the Washoe Mountains of west-central Nevada (12). - The native range of incense-cedar.",Native Range,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Yellow-green, pollen-bearing strobili are borne terminally on twigs as early as September and reach a length of about 6 mm (0.25 in) at pollen shed in late winter to early spring. Incense-cedar is monoecious; both male and female flowers may be borne on the same twig. Cones, inconspicuous in spring, are pendent and 20 to 40 mm (0.8 to 1.5 in) long when they mature in late summer. They are composed of three pairs of opposing leathery scales. Two of the six scales become greatly enlarged and form a cover around the two scales that bear the seeds. Each seed has two wings of unequal length. Embryos have two cotyledons. Seed Production and Dissemination- Although incense-cedars are considered prolific seed producers, medium to heavy seed crops are borne at intervals usually averaging 3 to 6 years. Sometimes, cone crops are absent entirely (22). In a southwestern. Oregon study, medium to abundant crops appeared in only 3 years, and light or no crops were found in 12 of the 15-year reporting period (28). As many as 961,500 seeds per hectare (389,100/acre) may fall during heavy production years (22). Geographic variability in cone and seed production is great (23). Seed dispersal begins in late August at the lowest elevations and in October at higher levels. Although seedfall may extend into winter months, seed soundness seems unrelated to time of dispersal (table 1). Incense-cedar seeds average 33,100/kg (15,000/lb) and vary from 14,100 to 63,900/kg (6,400 to 29,000/lb). Averages for collections from the northern and central part of incense-cedar's range vary from 29,800 to 44,500/kg (13,500 to 20,200/lb) (28). Because they are light in weight and have a large wing (averaging 2.5 cm (1 in) in length and nearly one-third that in width), seeds of incense-cedar fall slowly (1.8 m/s, or 5.9 ft/s, in still air) (22), and are carried great distances by wind. Seedling Development-Germination may be doubled by stratifying seeds at 3° to 5° C (37° to 41° F) for 30- to 60-day periods, although results are not always consistent. Germination under controlled conditions may be as much as 98 percent but usually averages 20 to 40 percent (28). These values are similar to those found under field conditions (22). Germination is epigeal (28). in nature, incense-cedar germinates on a wide range of surface conditions. Although survival is best under partial shade (22), incense-cedar seedlings survive over a broader array of site conditions than do most conifers (22,26). Initial rates of root growth are slow to moderate in incense-cedar compared with other species. In the first season, primary roots may extend to a depth of 30 cm (12 in), compared with as much as twice that length for ponderosa pine and sugar pine (22). Incense-cedar, therefore, is particularly susceptible to drought on exposed sites during the first year. Root systems develop rapidly, however, and by the end of the second year, lateral and tap root lengths compare well with ponderosa pine (29). In an artificially controlled study (33), seedling roots showed a peak of growth in the spring, with rates averaging 3 to 5 mm (0.12 to 0.20 in) per day. Growth slowed in midsummer, but increased again in fall, averaging 1 to 3 mm (0.04 to 0.12 in) per day between October and December. Activity cycles varied for individual roots. Not all roots were active at any one time. Incense-cedar lacks the distinct spring flush typical of many temperate conifers. Successive years' growth is not easily seen along the stem. Instead, elongation of several leaf internodes near the shoot tip in fall is arrested over winter and is not completed until the following spring. Hence, shoot growth is a more or less continuous process characterized by changes in tempo that are influenced primarily by current environment (9). On the Stanislaus National Forest in the central Sierra Nevada, CA, at an elevation of 1600 m (5,250 ft), seasonal height growth of incense-cedar started an average of 11 days later than ponderosa pine, was similar to sugar pine, but averaged 31 days earlier than white fir (22). At Challenge Experimental Forest, 1° 30' of latitude farther north in the Sierra Nevada and 810 m (2,660 ft) lower in elevation, sugar pine and ponderosa pine began height growth 3 to 5 weeks sooner than incense-cedar, and white fir began a week later (21). On the Stanislaus National Forest, the height growth period for incense-cedar lasts an average of 91 days, a period greater than for any other native species. At Challenge Experimental Forest it lasted 112 days but stopped sooner than the height growth period for ponderosa or sugar pine. Seasonal radial growth starts before height growth. On the Stanislaus National Forest, growth begins about April 15, some 2 weeks later than at Challenge. At both locations, however, incense-cedar begins radial growth at about the same time as ponderosa and sugar pine, but 2 weeks earlier than white fir. At both locations, the period of diameter growth for incense-cedar is second only to that for ponderosa pine, lasting 136 days at Stanislaus and 146 days at Challenge (21,22). Naturally regenerated incense-cedar grows slowly because of low sunlight or heavy browsing, often taking 3 to 5 years to reach a height of 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in). Although increased sunlight favors height growth, poor initial root development of naturally regenerated incense-cedar and preferential browsing by deer may mask its ability to respond to increased light, compared with other species (table 2). Incense-cedar raised from local seed and planted as 1-0 stock in a fresh clearcut at Challenge Experimental. Forest, however, grew faster than three other species, and at 6 years from planting was second only to ponderosa pine in both height and standing biomass (21). Apparently, the well-developed root systems of planted seedlings provide enough water uptake to sustain vigor, which helps seedlings resist browsing pressure. Established incense-cedar seedlings are remarkably drought tolerant. The species has been ranked more tolerant than sugar pine or ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or grand fir when grown in pumice, and second only to ponderosa pine when grown in sand (19). The tolerance was attributed to a complete occupancy of the soil mass by incense-cedar roots. In a controlled experiment, artificial dew more than doubled the survival period of incense-cedar seedlings grown in soils dried to permanent wilting point (31). Dew helped incense-cedar tolerate drought better than ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine, although pines were more tolerant when dew was withheld. At Challenge Experimental Forest, predawn measurements of xylem moisture tension in September showed that incense-cedar, ponderosa pine, and sugar pine were similar to each other and significantly lower in water stress than Douglas-fir or white-fir (21). Although drought may kill many first-year seedlings, particularly on compacted landings and skid trails, insects usually account for greater losses. Cutworms destroy many seedlings. Rodents are generally of only minor importance. During a 5-year period, 53 percent of the 1- to 2-month-old incense-cedar seedlings on Stanislaus National Forest plots were destroyed by cutworms (Noctuidae larvae) (22). The seed-to-seedling ratio on four cutover plots varied from 20:1 to 355:1 (22). Seedling tap roots may be damaged by root rot, but recovery can be rapid and tops may show no sign of attack (27). Vegetative Reproduction- Incense-cedar does not reproduce vegetatively in nature, but can be stimulated to do so in the greenhouse (18).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Incense-cedar varies greatly in size in different parts of its range. In the Coast Ranges and in southern California, the largest trees generally are from 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) tall and 90 to 120 cm (36 to 48 in) in d.b.h. In the Sierra Nevada, incense-cedars frequently grow to heights near 46 m (150 ft) with d.b.h.'s near 210 cm (84 in). The largest tree measured was 375 cm (148 in) in d.b.h. (1). A tree 69 m (225 ft) tall was reported from southern Oregon. At high elevations, especially on dry, exposed sites, trees tend to be small and scrubby. Incense-cedar is long-lived. Large trees often are more than 500 years old (22). The oldest recorded age is 542 years for a tree only 130 cm (51 in) in d.b.h. Growth rates of young mixed conifer stands in the central Sierra Nevada were investigated recently (3). In stands with basal areas of 23 to 69 m²/ha (100 to 300 ft²/acre), periodic annual increment of incense-cedar was 0.81 cm (0.32 in) in d.b.h. and 0.3 m (1.0 ft) in height at age 40. By age 90, periodic annual increment had declined to 0.36 cm (0.14 in) for d.b.h. and 0.2 m (0.6 ft) for height. Incense-cedar often grows more slowly than associated conifers and is therefore a major component of the intermediate and suppressed crown classes. Seldom does it contribute more than 5 to 10 percent of the stand volume (22). At Blodgett Forest in the northern Sierra Nevada, for example, volume growth of incense-cedar was consistently slower than its associates, regardless of stand density or tree size (4). In stands of moderate density, incense-cedar grew in volume at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, compounded. The average rate for all species was 2.3 percent. On poor sites, however, open-grown incense-cedars as large as 60 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. can exceed all other species, except white fir, in basal area growth (22). On better sites, incense-cedars generally fall behind and are forced to endure more and more shade. Increasing shade further slows their growth to the point of bare existence. On such trees, 16 annual rings per centimeter (40/in) of diameter are not uncommon (12). Rooting Habit- From seedling stage through maturity, incense-cedar has a more spreading and extensive rooting habit than many of its associates. This extensive, well-developed root system allows it to survive droughty sites and resist windthrow. Root branching of seedlings in an artificially controlled environment was inversely proportional to growth rate (33). Rapidly growing roots produced few laterals, but when growth of these roots temporarily ceased, laterals were produced in profusion. When growth resumed, laterals again were widely spaced, resulting in a node-internode pattern. Reaction to Competition- Incense-cedar has been rated as more shade tolerant (22) than the associated pines and Douglas-fir (16), and perhaps less tolerant than white fir and grand fir. In the seedling stage, incense-cedar can endure dense shade, especially in cool, moist environments (17). But for full development from sapling stage through maturity, it requires more light (22). Incense-cedar shows good response to release. Much of the extremely slow growth of young reproduction results from suppression or browsing. When released, seedlings grow rapidly in height. But because height growth usually is slower than that of associated species of comparable age, incense-cedar usually is a secondary species in the final stand (22). Although shaded out, lower branches are slow to shed, even in dense stands. Many dead branches must be removed, therefore, if clear lumber is to be produced in rotations of 80 to 120 years. Damaging Agents- Overmature incense-cedars are more defective than their associates. The amount of cull increases with age of the trees and varies among stands (22). Average cull percents based upon gross volume are 4 to 6 percent for immature dominants, 21 percent for mature dominants, and 68 to 77 percent for overmature dominants. The single most destructive agent affecting incense-cedar is the pocket dry rot (Tyromyces amarus). Pocket dry rot is most common in trees growing on good sites. In parts of the Sierra Nevada, 75 to 100 percent of the mature trees are infected. Trees on marginal sites near incense-cedar's eastern limit usually are infected less (2). The spores of pocket dry rot must be deposited on an open wound to infect trees because the mycelium cannot penetrate through the bark into the heartwood (14). The most prevalent port of entry is through fire scars (84 percent). Knots (10 percent) are next in frequency And injuries resulting from lightning and frost (6 percent) are least (22). Pocket dry rot seems relatively resistant to heartwood extractives that are toxic to other heart-rotting fungi and may actually detoxify them (34). This unusual ability may explain the apparent anomaly of highly defective heartwood in live, overmature trees and high durability of heartwood in sawn products. In management of young-growth incense-cedar, the age at which dry rot begins to cause losses is of primary significance. Suppressed trees are subject to severe dry rot infection after they reach 165 years, but dominant trees generally are safe until 210 years old (22). Because the rotation age of young-growth stands is considerably less than these critical ages, pocket dry rot should not cause severe cull in managed stands. Two other fungi that occasionally rot the heartwood of living incense-cedar are Phellinus pini and Phaeolus schweinitzii (10). Root disease kills more incense-cedar trees than any other pathogen (24). Of the three facultative, parasitic fungi found attacking incense-cedar roots, Armillaria sp., Heterobasidion annosum, and Phellinus weiri, probably the most destructive is Heterobasidion annosum. More than 100 H. annosum infection centers have been confirmed on developed sites in Yosemite Valley, CA (25). Property damage caused by falling root-diseased trees has been substantial and has led to the development of a risk-rating system. On the basis of crown characteristics, the system predicts the potential for early failure of root-diseased incense-cedar (25). The only foliage disease of any consequence is the rust caused by Gymnosporangium libocedri (10), which infects incense-cedar of all ages, causing witches' brooms, but only infrequently kills smaller branches. Although extensive infections of leaf rust retard growth, no deaths have been attributed directly to the disease. Infections in the main stem may result in burls that cause defect in lumber (2). Ozone, the major plant-damaging constituent of photochemical oxidant air pollution, injures the foliage of many coniferous species. Incense-cedar is insensitive to injury from ozone. It appears to have sufficient numbers of tolerant individuals so that it may be planted with reasonable success in the ozone-affected forests common in the southern portion of this species' natural range (15). Incense-cedar mistletoe (Phoradendron juniperinum subsp. libocedri) grows on incense-cedar throughout the range of the tree. This true mistletoe causes elongated swellings on the branches and occasionally on the trunk. Severe infections suppress growth but rarely kill large trees (2). Many species of insects are found on incense-cedar, but relatively few cause serious losses. A cone sawfly (Augomonoctenus libocedrii) sometimes infests cones, resulting in damage resembling that of cone-feeding caterpillars (6). The juniper scale (Carulaspis juniperi) is a European species now distributed throughout the range of incense-cedar (6). It attacks twigs, leaves, branches, and cones, causing the foliage to turn yellow. Sometimes branches and entire trees are killed. Six species of cedar bark beetles (Phloeosinus spp.) can be found working under bark of trunks, tops, and limbs of weakened, dying, or felled trees or of broken branches (6). Although damage usually is inconsequential, beetles occasionally become sufficiently numerous and aggressive to attack and kill apparently healthy trees. Several wood borers have been found in incense-cedar, but none poses a threat to the life of the tree (6). The flatheaded cedar borer (Chrysobothris nixa) mines the bark and outer wood of limbs, trunks, and roots of weakened, dying, and dead trees, principally in the coast region. The amethyst cedar borer (Semanotus amethystinus) is similar to Chrysobothris nixa but confines its work to the inner bark and a scoring of the outer sapwood of boles and large limbs throughout the range of incense-cedar. The western cedar borer (Trachykele blondeli), like Chrysobothris nixa, can cause serious degrade and cull in trees cut for products requiring sound wood. Its larvae mine the sapwood and heartwood of living trees. Trachykele opulenta is similar to T. blondeli but less destructive. The incense-cedar wasp (Syntexis libocedrii) bores in the sapwood of fire-scorched trees in California. Fire has played a significant role in the health and relative abundance of incense-cedar in mixed-conifer stands. Sapling incense-cedars are more readily killed by fire than most of their associates; the thick bark of mature incense-cedar offers considerable protection from fire. Intense fires indirectly result in more damage to mature trees, however, by exposing trunks to infection by pocket dry rot. As a result of fire control by land management agencies beginning about 1900, and partial cutting practices, the proportion of incense-cedar in the understory has increased. Incense-cedar is favored because it is a prolific seeder and because the shade-tolerant seedlings and saplings can persist for long periods in the understory.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,14,1
"Incense-cedar grows on many kinds of soils developed from a wide variety of parent rocks-rhyolite, pumice, andesite, diorite, sandstone, shale, basalt, peridotite, serpentinite, limestone, and granitic or metamorphic: equivalents. It is particularly adept at extracting soil phosphorus (21) and calcium (35), and excluding surplus magnesium. Soils supporting incense-cedar vary greatly. Reaction ranges from nearly neutral to strongly acid. Textures vary from coarse sands to very fine clays. The best stands generally are found on deep, well-drained, sandy loam soils developed on granitic rocks and sandstone; deep clay loams developed on basalt and rhyolite; and occasionally on deep, coarse-textured, well-drained soils developed from pumice. In California, incense-cedar grows best on deep, slightly to moderately acid Ultic Haploxeralfs, such as the Holland series weathered from granitic rock, and the Cohasset series derived from andesite and basalt. Incense-cedar also grows on infertile soils derived from peridotite or serpentinite throughout the Sierra Nevada and tends to be restricted to these soils in western portions of the north Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains (7). Although it is a good competitor on these soils because of its apparent ability to extract calcium and exclude magnesium, its growth is considerably less than on more fertile sites. Apparently the high calcium-extracting ability of incense-cedar may interfere with magnesium and micronutrient uptake on limestone. Incense-cedars are rare on limestone soils, and the trees that do grow there contain high concentrations of calcium and low concentrations of manganese and zinc (35). Incense-cedar grows at elevations between 50 and 2010 m (165 and 6,600 ft) in its northern extreme (30), and between 910 and 2960 m (3,000 to 9,700 ft) in its southern limits. In the Sierra Nevada, the tree grows best at elevations between 610 and 2100 m (2,000 to 6,900 ft). Once established, incense-cedar is a good competitor on hot, dry sites and commonly shares an upper canopy position on southwestern slopes. On cooler, moister aspects, it is usually subdominant to other species.",Soils and Topography,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,15,1
"The outstanding durability and resistance to decay of lumber from incense-cedar heartwood make it ideal for exterior use where moisture is present. This wood gives long service with little maintenance in such uses as mud sills, window sashes, sheathing under stucco or brick veneer construction, greenhouse benches, fencing, poles, and trellises (12). Incense-cedar also is used extensively for exterior siding because it is dimensionally stable and holds paint well, in addition to being durable. Rich color, sound knots, and aromatic fragrance make the wood popular for interior paneling and woodwork. At present, pecky cedar (boards sawn from trees infected with pocket dry rot) is in demand for paneling and backyard fencing, thereby making a market for poor quality grades that formerly were not utilized. Incense-cedar is ideally suited to the manufacture of pencils because it is soft, easily whittled, and has straight grain (12). Much of the top-grade lumber produced goes to this use. Incense-cedar is cultivated widely as an ornamental tree both within its natural range and as an introduced species. The tree grows well in western and central Europe (11) and in the Eastern United States as far north as Massachusetts.",Special Uses,Incense-Cedar,libocedrus,decurrens,conifer,16,1
"The Jack Pine forest cover type (Society of American Foresters Type 1) (26) typically originates after forest fires. It is found in pure, even-aged stands or as a majority of the stocking over vast areas of Canada and to a much lesser extent in the Lake States and the northeastern United States (61). In the boreal forest jack pine is also a component of three other forest cover types-Black Spruce (Type 12), Paper Birch (Type 18), and Aspen (Type 16). In the northern forest region it is a component of two forest cover types-Red Pine (Type 15) and Northern Pin Oak (Type 14). Outliers near southern fringes of the species' range are found in various types of hardwood forest (12). Associated tree species, listed in order of presence on dry to mesic sites, include northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), red pine (Pinus resinosa), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), quaking aspen (P. tremuloides), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), northern red oak Quercus rubra), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), red maple (Acer rubrum), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (P. mariana), tamarack (Larix laricina), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). In the boreal forest the most common associates are quaking aspen, paper birch, balsam fir, and black spruce. In the northern forest they are northern pin oak, red pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and balsam fir. Associates are nearly always subordinate to jack pine except for aspen, paper birch, and red pine which may be coordinate (26,61). Infrequent associates in the northeastern United States and adjacent Canada include white oak (Quercus alba), pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica), gray birch (Betula populifolia), red spruce (Picea rubens), and pitch pine (Pinus rigida) (61). In Canada, six subtypes of jack pine may be recognized based upon the edaphic and climatic conditions where they are found and on associated species as follows: jack pine-balsam fir-black spruce (subtype a); jack pine-feather moss (subtype b); jack pine-sheep laurel (subtype c); jack pine-sphagnum. (subtype d); jack pine-labrador-tea (subtype e); jack pine-lichen (subtype f) (26). The preceding subtype descriptions apply primarily to eastern Canada. However, jack pine forests in Saskatchewan bear close resemblance to some of the subtypes described above (43). Subtypes, as such, are not recognized in the Lake States. There are, however, certain variants of the type, including jack pine-black spruce, jack pine-red pine, and northern pin oak-jack pine (26).",Associated Forest Cover,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,1,1
"In the eastern part of its range, jack pine grows in a maritime climate but elsewhere it is found in diverse continental climates characterized by short, warm to cool summers, very cold winters, and low rainfall. The average January and July temperatures range from -29° to -4° C (-20° to 25° F) and from 13° to 22° C (55° to 72° F), respectively. Average annual maximum temperatures range from 29° to 38° C (85° to 100° F), and average annual minimum temperatures are from -21° to -46° C (-5° to -50° F) (61). Mean annual temperatures range between -5° and 4° C (23° and 40° F) (74). The northern limits of the range closely parallel the 29° C (85° F) mean annual maximum isotherm. Frost may occur in some areas during any month and in the Northwest the range extends into the permafrost zone. (61). Average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 1400 mm (10 to 55 in) but 380 to 890 mm (15 to 35 in) are more usual. The average warm season precipitation ranges from 150 to 640 mm (6 to 25 in). Annual snowfall is from 76 to 508 cm (30 to 200 in), but over much of the range it is between 102 and 254 cm (40 to 100 in). Summer droughts are common in the south-central and western portions of the range (61). The average date of the last killing spring frost ranges from April 30 to about July 1; and the average date of the first killing fall frost ranges from about August 10 to October 20. The frost-free period averages from 50 to 173 days but is usually from 80 to 120 days. Generally, temperature, rainfall, and frost-free period increase from the northwestern toward the southeastern part of the range (61).",Climate,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,2,1
"The various environments in which jack pine grows over its wide range have provided ample opportunity for differentiation and natural selection (72). Virtually the entire present range of jack pine was glaciated during the most recent Wisconsin stage that reached its maximum about 18,000 years ago. The present distribution of the species therefore results from re-invasion and migration over huge areas and great distances in a relatively short time, estimated at 15,000 years since the retreat of the ice began in earnest. Available paleobotanical evidence suggests that jack pine survived the Wisconsin glacial maximum at low elevations in the Appalachian Mountains south of latitude 34° N. and also in the western Ozark Mountains. From these refugia it migrated to the north and east and up the Mississippi Valley, and westward around the southern end of the Lake Agassiz basin (72).",Genetics,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,7,1
"Although putative hybrids have been reported between jack pine and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), loblolly pine (P. taeda), and Japanese black pine (P. thunbergiana) (72), jack pine x lodgepole pine (P. x murraybanksiana Righter and Stockwell) is the only verified interspecific hybrid in which jack pine is a parent (59). Widely scattered tests of the artificially created hybrids have shown mixed results, probably because the origin of the parents was not always matched with the environment of the test site (25,50,58). Tests of the California-developed F1 hybrids, F2, backcross progeny, and the two parent species in northern Wisconsin and eastern Ontario showed that winter injury was associated with affinity to one or the other parent-it ranged from very severe in the lodgepole pine from California to none in the jack pine (70,87). Polygenic inheritance was indicated suggesting that the backcross breeding method might be used to develop lines suitable for environments tolerated by the hardier parent. The hybrids and the lodgepole parent were more susceptible to sweetfern rust and to eastern gall rust than local jack pine in tests in the Lake States and Ontario (2,84). The form noted in some hybrids suggested some potential as Christmas trees but not as forest trees (4). However, because of the high susceptibility to sweetfern rust reported in eastern and central Canada, the hybrids should not be planted in that region (84). Natural hybrids between jack pine and lodgepole pine occur in areas of contact in central and northwestern Alberta (21,61,75) and in scattered locations in Saskatchewan (5,6). Differences in cone morphology provide the strongest diagnostic features for distinguishing the hybrids in the field (61,72). The turpentine of jack pine consists almost entirely of alpha- and beta-pinene but that of lodgepole pine is mostly beta-phellandrene with small amounts of 3-carene and the two pinenes. The hybrid contains one-fourth beta-phellandrene and three-fourths pinenes. Thus, in the F1 hybrids the bicyclic terpenes of jack pine dominate over the simpler monocyclic terpene of lodgepole pine in a 3-to-1 ratio (61). Further study of the segregation for turpentine components in the hybrids suggested that the composition is probably controlled primarily by a limited number of genes with major effects (88). Discrimination between lodgepole pine and putative hybrids with jack pine based on analysis of monoterpenes showed that the transition zone between the species may be farther west than previously reported (56).",Hybrids,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,9,1
"Numerous jack pine provenance or seed source tests, established beginning in the early 1940's, have provided information on variation among provenances (72). Studies of variation have included controlled environment chamber, greenhouse, nursery, and field experiment. Growth, the characteristic most frequently emphasized in provenance studies, has been found to follow a generally clinal pattern associated with environmental gradients of latitude (photoperiod) and length and temperature of the growing season at the seed origin (72). Differences in growth among provenances have been demonstrated beginning at the young seedling stage and by age 15 to 20 years the differences among provenances in tree growth and wood production are substantial (72). For example, in a test of Lake States provenances at 14 locations, trees of two provenances from northeastern Minnesota were only 71 percent of the plantation mean height in a central Wisconsin plantation whereas trees of the tallest source, from Lower Michigan, exceeded the plantation mean by 17 percent after 20 years (40). Translated to volume growth and considering tree survival, the volume per hectare of trees in the poorest provenances was only 38 percent of the plantation mean and that of the best was 187 percent of the plantation mean. These results clearly show the importance of selecting and using the best provenance or seed source in jack pine reforestation efforts and the magnitude of the losses in wood production that may result when seed origin is ignored. Provenance test results in Canada have similarly shown wide differences in growth among provenances (72,84,85,86,87). Most provenance tests show that trees of provenances from areas nearest the planting sites grow as well as or better than the average of trees of all provenances (72). In the Lake States, however, trees of provenances that were moved slightly northward outgrew those of the local provenance (40). Thus, although wide latitudinal movement of provenances is not suggested, movement up to 160 km (100 mi) northward in the Lake States can increase growth. Selection of superior provenances within latitudinal belts of similar climate should make substantial genetic gains possible (72). Biomass production of trees in 24- and 25-year-old plantations of four Lake States provenances at three locations ranged from 2.7 to 6.1 t/ha (about 1.2 to 2.7 tons/acre) annually (89). Total biomass and mean annual biomass were negatively related to latitude of the plantation. Movement of provenances slightly northward within climatic zones resulted in increased biomass production of the trees but movement from warmer to colder short-growing-season zones resulted in poor growth. Although tree growth has been the single most important trait evaluated in provenance tests, variation among provenances in other tree characteristics also has been noted. These include tree form as influenced by branching characteristics, wood and bark properties, cold hardiness, autumn foliage color variation in young seedlings, seed yield and quality, isozyme systems, and numerous instances of genetic variation in susceptibility or resistance to diseases and insect pests (72). The vast information available from provenance test results is being applied to the establishment of seed collection zones, breeding zones, and regional jack pine improvement programs in the Lake States (44) and in Canada (72).",Hybrids,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,9,1
"The major portion of the jack pine range is in Canada where its northern boundary extends eastward from the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories across the country to Cape Breton Island, NS. The range then extends southwest through Maine, New Hampshire, northern New York, central Quebec and northern Ontario, Michigan, extreme northwest Indiana, northeast Illinois, then northwest through Wisconsin, Minnesota, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, central Alberta, to extreme northeast British Columbia (72). Within its range, jack pine is widely but not continuously distributed. In Canada it is most abundant in Ontario, and in the United States, the largest acreages are in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan (74). The only significant artificial extensions of the jack pine range have been on strip-mined areas in the central and northeastern States (61) and on the sand hills of Nebraska (11). - The native range of jack pine.",Native Range,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,11,1
"The wide genetic variation found in the species suggests it has large effective breeding populations, heterozygosity for many alleles, and strong natural selection against self-fertilization and increased homozygosity (72). A study of 33 characteristics of tree crown, bark, wood, foliage, and cones of mature trees over most of the natural range showed that all varied significantly according to the geographic origin of the populations. An average of 37 percent of the variation was due to origin (74). Environmental factors appear to be the dominant selection forces responsible for the natural variation over the present-day jack pine range. The area of optimum development of jack pine is north of the Great Lakes in Ontario and Quebec (19,47). Certain traits of jack pine have been demonstrated to be under strong genetic control including cone shape, cone serotiny, cone volume, cone length, scale number, number of scales to first ovule, and number of scales to first seed (53,61,76,79). Early flowering appears to be under additive genetic control and not under the control of a single major gene or recessive genes (41). Lammas growth and prolepsis, which may be detrimental to tree form, are under some genetic control (62,63), and many of the traits contributing to desirable Christmas tree form are highly heritable (55).",Population Differences,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Jack pine is a monoecious species. Ovulate cones are usually borne on primary and secondary branches in the upper tree crown and staminate cones are usually borne on tertiary branches lower in the crown. Ovulate cones are modified long shoots and staminate cones are modified dwarf shoots (24). In northeastern Wisconsin, bud initiation for the following year's shoot systems begins in late June or early July. Staminate cone primordia are initiated in early or mid-July but ovulate primordia are not initiated until August. By early September the staminate cone primordia are about 1 mm (0.04 in) long and remain that size until spring. Then they elongate to about 5 mm (0.2 in) by the middle of May and early June just before pollen is shed. Rapid elongation up to several more millimeters occurs as the pollen is shed. Time of pollen shedding (anthesis) varies greatly from year to year depending on the weather (23). Fertilization occurs about 13 months after pollination when the female cone is approaching its maximum size (27). Jack pine is normally a wind-pollinated, cross-fertilizing species but up to 25 percent or rarely more natural selfing can occur (29,64). Under natural conditions, however, survival of selfed and other inbred seedlings is severely reduced by natural selection against the semilethal and other deleterious characteristics carried by the inbred seedlings (67). Cones mature and the seeds ripen late in the growing season of the year after pollination. Various cone and seed characteristics, including cone color, volume, fresh and dry weight, specific gravity, scale color, seed color, and embryo length, can aid in determining seed ripeness. In northeastern Wisconsin the best indicators of cone and seed ripeness are cone color, 75 percent brown; insides of the cone scales, reddish brown; seeds, dark brown or black; and cone moisture content, less than 45 percent of fresh weight. These indicators of cone and seed ripeness coincide with the beginning of cone harvesting by squirrels about September 10. Because specific gravity of the serotinous cones usually remains above 1.0 at least until February, flotation techniques cannot be used to evaluate cone and seed ripeness in jack pine (18). Seed Production and Dissemination- Jack pine trees, particularly under good early growing conditions, begin to flower at a younger age than most other pine species (41,65,68). Under near optimum growing conditions in the greenhouse and nursery, female flowering can be induced in a small percentage of seedlings as early as 12 months from seed sowing (68). Male flowering under these conditions usually does not begin until the fourth year. An accumulated yield of 2,861,000 filled seeds per hectare (1,158,000/acre) can be produced through the first 8 years in plantations with 2.4 m (8 ft) between trees (67). In naturally regenerated stands, jack pine typically begins to flower at 5 to 10 years under open-grown conditions but not until later in closed stands (61). Once cone production in jack pine begins, it is fairly regular and increases until crown competition becomes a factor. Seed production differs from year to year but some seed is usually produced every year and total crop failures are rare (31,61). Seed yields per cone range from about 15 to 75 (72). Strongly curved cones yield less seed than straight ones (72). Ovulate abortion on the inner curvature of cones is twice that on the outer curvature (17). The average number of scales per cone can be more than 80 but usually only a little more than one-third of the scales, those in the upper end of the cones, bear seeds (72). Over much of its natural range jack pine bears predominantly serotinous cones, but in the southern part cones are nonserotinous. Total seeds stored on the trees in serotinous cones can reach more than 14.6 kg or 4 million seeds per hectare (13.0 lb or 1.6 million/acre) in well stocked mature stands (61). As viability after 5 to 10 years may be significantly reduced, however, only cones 6 years old or less should be collected (8). Commercially cleaned seeds range between 156,500 and 551,000/kg (71,000 and 250,000/lb) with an average of 288,800/kg (131,000/lb) (45). Well-stocked, mature stands in the Lake States dispersed an annual average of 6,670 to 25,950 seeds per hectare (2,700 to 10,500/acre) over 5 years; much of the total crop remained in the unopened cones. In areas with nonserotinous or partially serotinous cones, seed may be disseminated during any season. The effective range of seed dissemination, as measured by established seedlings, is about two tree heights although it is low beyond one tree height (61). The melting temperature of the resinous bonding material of the cone scales is 50° C (122° F), but it is likely that the bonding resin softens at lower temperatures in the nonserotinous types in the southern portion of the species' range. The mechanism of cone opening in both serotinous and nonserotinous cones is hygroscopic. Once the bonding material of the cone scales is broken, the quantity of water in the scales is the limiting factor in scale movement and flexing outward under drying condition (35,61). Jack pine cones open most readily during dry weather when the temperature is at least 27° C (80° F), although many of them remain closed until they are exposed to fire or high temperatures near the ground after wind breakage or logging. Over most of its range where serotinous cones are common, up to 50 percent may open on the sunny part of the crown. Cones may also open in very cold winters when the temperature is -46° C (-50° F) or colder (61). Cone and seed crops in jack pine may be reduced by numerous agents (61). Rainy weather at time of pollination may reduce seed set. Cone and seed production are also reduced by cone and ovulate abortion (17,66), but the severe losses previously attributed to abortion may be partially the result of insect attacks. Within a cone, all the ovules near the base of the cone abort and abortion decreases toward the tip (17). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (45). Jack pine seed usually germinates within 15 to 60 days under favorable conditions (61), but some seeds require more than 100 days to germinate (72). Delayed germination of direct seeding increased stocking between the first and third year after sowing (60). Under forest conditions with adequate moisture, seeds germinate when air temperatures reach 18° C (64° F) but light also influences germination (2,61). Under continuous light, germination was complete at a range of temperatures from 16° to 27° C (60° to 80° F) (2). Germination was markedly reduced at all temperatures when light was excluded. The shade cast by slash and snags on burned-over or cut-over areas to reduce surface temperature and drying undoubtedly contributes substantially to the good germination often observed on such areas (16). Type of seedbed is an important factor affecting jack pine seed germination (16,61). In northeastern Minnesota, germination under clearcut and partially cut jack pine stands averaged 60 percent on mineral soil, 49 percent on burned duff, 47 percent on scarified and shaded duff, and 17 percent on undisturbed duff (61). The poor germination on litter and humus is caused by poor moisture conditions and it can be satisfactory in years of above normal precipitation. Germination may be delayed by spring drought (16). Associated species can affect germination, survival, and growth of jack pine differentially, probably as a result of allelopathy (13). Survival on various seedbeds shows the same trend as germination (61). Optimum conditions for jack pine seedling establishment and survival are provided by mineral soil and burned seedbeds where competition from other vegetation is not severe (16), the water table is high, and there is some shade (61). Competition from shrubs and herbaceous vegetation, together with smothering by fallen leaves, are important causes of seedling mortality on sandy soils in Ontario. On clay soils in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, competition from aspen and hazel are responsible for poor survival. On similar soils in western Manitoba competing grasses kill many seedlings (16). Most of the older jack pine stands appear to have been established following fires (61). Although jack pine seed usually germinates following fire, most of the seedlings die unless the organic matter left on the soil is less than 1.3 cm (0.5 in) thick. Most germination occurs the first and second season following fire, with most mortality between the first and second growing season. Unless conditions for germination and early survival are favorable, good regeneration does not necessarily follow burns (20,61). Young seedlings grow tallest in full sunlight (48), although under stands their initial abundance may be greatest in light intensities of 11 to 30 percent of full sunlight, but no seedlings are found at 60 percent and higher crown cover (61). Under forest conditions, seedling growth is slow in the first 3 years but increases rapidly beginning in the fourth and fifth years. Seedlings attain a height of about 5 cm (2 in) the first year, 15 cm (6 in) at 2 years, and 30 to 90 cm (12 to 36 in) at 4 years. Early growth of 2-0 seedlings in plantations is more rapid, amounting to 30 to 45 cm (12 to 18 in) per year on medium sites (61). Shoot growth begins in late April and early May at Cloquet, MN, and Chalk River, ON (62,63,80), and about May 10 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (61). Essentially all height growth is completed in 61 to 68 days at the three locations. Maximum growth rate approaches 1 cm (0.4 in) per day in both Minnesota and Ontario. Although shoot growth in jack pine ceases long before the end of the frost-free season, the remaining time may be necessary to complete latewood growth, lignification, terminal bud development, and hardening off to resist frost (80). If favorable moisture conditions prevail in late summer, jack pine frequently has a second period of shoot elongation and produces lammas and proleptic shoots (62,63). Trees with lammas shoots had a longer growth period than those without them but did not grow significantly less the following year. The late growth does not result in detectable increases in diameter growth and it may or may not result in false rings. Fall frost injury resulting in frost rings, however, may be frequent in the current shoots of trees with lammas growth. Vegetative Reproduction- Under natural conditions jack pine does not reproduce vegetatively. Jack pine cuttings from young trees can be rooted but rooting ability decreases rapidly with increasing ortet age. Cuttings from 4-month-old seedlings gave 75 percent rooting (7) but average rooting was only 7 percent in cuttings from 6-year-old ortets and 5 percent in those from 10-year-old ortets (90). Clonal variation in rooting percentage ranged from 0 to 31. Aryl esters of indole auxins can enhance rooting of jack pine cuttings taken from young seedlings. Phenyl indole-3-butyric (P-IBA) treatment caused 12 percent more jack pine cuttings to root than did treatment with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and up to 30 percent more than no treatment (34). Rooting needle fascicles has potential for establishing large clones in a short time. Shearing the terminal buds on trees up to 5 years old induces the fascicular buds to differentiate and develops shoots. Treating such shoots from 2-year-old trees with IBA (0.1 percent) and placing them in a heated rooting medium under a 20-hour photoperiod resulted in up to 70 percent rooting (71). Jack pine can be grafted, most successfully using dormant scions and when grafting is done just as the rootstock resumes growth in the spring. Both early and delayed graft incompatibility may occur; the causes are unknown (72). No complete jack pine plants have yet been propagated from either callus tissue or cell suspension cultures (72).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,13,1
"In well-stocked stands, jack pine develops into a short to medium-tall, slender tree with a narrow, open crown covering 30 to 45 percent of the stem (61). Crown ratios from 10 to 20 percent are not uncommon in dense stands. Open-grown jack pine develops a stocky stem of poor form and a wide, spreading crown with persistent branches, often to the ground. Overstocked stands produce weak, spindly stems that are susceptible to breakage by wind, ice, and snow (10). Growth and Yield- During the first 20 years, jack pine in its native range is the fastest growing conifer other than tamarack (61). Seedlings reach 1.4 m (4.5 ft) tall in 5 to 8 years, depending on site. In the Lake States, 20-year-old stands with 2,470 trees per hectare (1,000/acre) on sites ranging from site index 12 to 21 m (40 to 70 ft) average between 5.5 and 9.8 m (18 and 32 ft) tall, 6.7 and 20.0 m² (29 and 87 ft²) in basal area, 5.8 and 10.2 cm (2.3 and 4.0 in) in d.b.h. (46), and 14 600 and 62 800 kg/ha (13,000 and 56,000 lb/acre) in ovendry weight of above-ground biomass (3). The generalized equations used to derive these biomass estimates (3) give results similar to biomass production reported in other natural jack pine stands (22,32,37,51). Mean annual biomass production of 43-year-old natural jack pine stands in Quebec ranged from 1.42 to 2.47 t/ha (0.63 to 1.10 tons/acre) (28); in 7- to 57-year-old jack pine in New Brunswick from 0.94 to 2.76 t/ha (0.42 to 1.23 tons/acre) (51); and in 20- to 100-year-old stands in Ontario from about 1.17 to 3.38 t/ha (0.52 to 1.51 tons/acre) (45). In 24- and 25-year-old plantations in the Lake States, the highest mean annual biomass production was 58 percent higher than the maximum reported in the literature, when seed source and site were properly matched (89). Annual height growth on medium sites (site index 17 m (55 ft)) in the Lake States averages from 33 cm (13 in) at age 30 to 23 cm (9 in) at age 50. At age 80 years, annual height growth is only 13 cm (5 in) (46) On typical sand plains sites, growth is about one site quality better where the water table is 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) from the soil surface than where it is deeper (61). Normally, mature trees are about 17 to 20 m (55 to 65 ft) tall and 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) d.b.h., although some trees have attained 30 m (100 ft) in height and 64 cm (25 in) in d.b.h. (46,61), and one tree listed by the American Forestry Association in 1982 measured 73.4 cm (28.9 in) in d.b.h. and 25.6 m (84 ft) tall. Stand basal areas seldom exceed 37 m²/ha (160 ft²/acre) (46). Jack pine stands begin to disintegrate after 80 years on the best sites and after 60 years on the poorest sites. Vigorous trees 185 years old have been found in northwestern Minnesota, however. The oldest tree reported- 230 years old- was found east of Lake Nipigon in Ontario (61). Growth is somewhat slower, but maintained longer, in Canada. Average stocking on sites having a site index range of 14 to 17 m (45 to 55 ft) in southern Manitoba produces a culmination of mean annual increment at 50 to 60 years with 1.6 to 3.2 m³/ha (23 to 46 ft³/acre) of merchantable material (9). For average site (site index 14 m (45 ft)) and stocking in Saskatchewan, mean annual increment culminates at about 70 years with 2.0 merchantable m³/ha (28 ft³/acre) (42). In fully stocked stands on average sites (site class 2) in Ontario, mean annual increment culminates at about age 60 with 2.7 m³/ha (38 ft³/acre) of merchantable material (54). Yields from well-stocked, unmanaged jack pine stands in the Lake States at 60 years are shown in table 1 (46), along with yields from well-stocked unmanaged stands in Saskatchewan (42). Rotation age of 40 to 50 years is recommended to produce pulpwood and 60 to 70 years is recommended to produce poles and sawtimber. Rooting Habit- Jack pine frequently develops a taproot as a seedling and maintains it to maturity. During the first growing season under natural conditions the seedling root system penetrates to a depth of 13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 in). By the end of the second growing season jack pine seedlings on typical sandy soils in the open have a dry weight between 1 and 2 g (0.04 and 0.08 oz), have developed 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) tops, and have root systems from 28 to 33 cm (11 to 13 in) deep and from 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) wide. On a moist sandy soil with the water table about 76 cm (30 in) below the surface in Upper Michigan, roots penetrated to 53 cm (21 in) in 2 years but only to 61 cm (24 in) by 7 years; the lateral spread, however, increased from 0.9 to 1.2 m (3 to 4 ft) at 2 years to 4.3 to 4.9 m (14.0 to 16.2 ft) at 7 years. In the 7-year-old trees the average volume of the top, stem, branches, and foliage was about 4000 cm³ (244 in³) as compared to 1200 cm³ (73 in³) for the root system (61). In northern Minnesota, root growth begins when the temperature reaches 4° C (40° F) in the upper 15 cm (6 in) of soil, usually within a week of the onset of shoot growth. Root growth ceases in the fall when soil temperature drops to 7° C (45° F) for 6 days or more. In some years root growth may begin in April and continue to late October. Seven-year-old trees elongated their lateral roots an average of 38 cm (15 in) in 1 year (61). In Manitoba, root development of jack pine growing on dry and fresh sands was confined mainly to the taproot for the first 1 to 3 years, but lateral branching became increasingly common on 3- to 4-year-old seedlings. Mycorrhizae were found on 1-year-old seedlings (16). On deep, well-drained soils the roots may penetrate below 2.7 m (9 ft). Trees without distinct taproots usually have lateral roots that turn and grow downward as they approach other trees. The bulk of the root system, however, consists of laterals confined largely to the upper 46 cm (18 in) of soil; much of the root system is in the upper 15 cm (6 in) of soil. In 25-year-old jack pine stands in central Wisconsin, the dry weight of all roots in the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) of soil was 10 980 to 13 790 kg/ha (9,800 to 12,300 lb/acre) (61). A 40-year-old stand of jack pine in northern Minnesota produced 28 000 kg/ha (24,978 lb/acre), ovendry weight, of roots greater than 0.5 cm (0.2 in) and stumps less than 15 cm (6 in) tall (73). Reaction to Competition- Jack pine is one of the most shade-intolerant trees in its native range. It is the least tolerant of its associated pine species and is slightly more tolerant than aspen, birch, and tamarack. Jack pine may be more tolerant in the seedling stage and often requires some shade on dry sites to reduce surface temperatures and evapotranspiration. Soon after seedlings are established, however, they should receive full sunlight to assure survival (10,61). Overall, jack pine can most accurately be classed as intolerant of shade. Overstocked jack pine seedling and sapling stands with 4,950 or more trees per hectare (2,000/acre) should be weeded or cleaned (precommercial thinning) to improve growth and development. Otherwise such stands may stagnate because natural thinning in jack pine stands is slow except on the best sites (10). A study in northern Minnesota, wherein direct seeding produced a stand averaging 32,100 trees per hectare (13,000/acre) at age 5 years, compared the growth of no thinning with thinning to square spacings of 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 m (4, 6, and 8 ft). Twenty-two years later the treatments averaged 9, 10, 13, and 15 cm (3.7, 4.1, 5.1, and 5.8 in) in d.b.h., respectively (14). Planting, direct seedings, and precommercial thinnings should have a goal of 2,000 to 3,000 trees per hectare (800 to 1,200/acre) by age 10 years (19,30). Jack pine is a pioneer species on burns or other exposed sites. In the absence of fire or other catastrophes, jack pine is succeeded by more tolerant species, but on the poorest, driest sites it may persist and form an edaphic climax. In loamy sands and sandy loams in northern Minnesota, the usual succession is from jack pine to red pine to eastern white pine to a hardwood type composed of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), basswood (Tilia americana), and northern red oak. Frequently, the red pine and white pine stages are absent and jack pine is followed by speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), American hazel (Corylus americana), beaked hazel (C. cornuta), paper birch, and quaking aspen. This stage is followed by either the sugar maple-basswood association or spruce-fir. On loamy soils in northeastern Minnesota and parts of Canada, jack pine is succeeded by black spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, and paper birch. Eventually, the paper birch is eliminated from this association. In parts of northwestern Canada, jack pine may be replaced directly by white spruce; in parts of eastern Canada, the immediate succession may be to pure black spruce (10,26,61). Damaging Agents- Jack pine is subject to many agents that cause damage or mortality. Young jack pines are especially susceptible to early spring fires. Severe drought may kill many seedlings, particularly on coarse soils. All young jack pines less than 1.5 m (5 ft) tall and 55 percent of those from 1.5 to 3.7 m (5 to 12 ft) tall were killed by 123 days of flooding in northern Minnesota. Heavy populations of white-tailed deer can kill young jack pines up to 2.1 m (7 ft) tall, retard total height growth to half its potential, and deform most trees so they have little future value for timber products. Snowshoe hares can severely damage jack pine reproduction, particularly in dense stands in trees less than 4 cm (1.5 in) in d.b.h. (16,61). Jack pine seedlings are greatly damaged by elk in western Manitoba when animal populations are high, and meadow voles cause occasional damage and mortality by gnawing the bark off main stems and lower branches (16). Porcupines can cause extensive damage in older stands (74). Numerous insects affect the survival and growth of jack pine seedlings (83). The more important groups of these are as follows: (1) root borers such as the pales weevil (Hylobius pales), pine root collar weevil (H. radicis), pine root tip weevil (H. rhizophagus), and Warren's collar weevil (H. warreni); (2) shoot and stem borers such as the northern pine weevil (Pissodes approximatus), the white pine weevil (P. strobi), and the Allegheny mound ant (Formica exsectoides); (3) leaf feeders such as numerous sawflies (Neodiprion sertifer, N. pratti banksianae, N. swainei, N. nigroscutum, N. compar, N. lecontei, N. dubiosus, N. nanulus nanulus), Diprion similus, jack pine budworm, pine chafer (Anomala oblivia), and pine webworm (Tetralopha robustella); (4) needle miners such as Argyrotaenia tabulana, Exoteleia pinifoliella, and Zelleria haimbachi; (5) root feeders including primarily white grubs (Phyllaophaga spp.); and (6) sucking insects such as two midges (Cecidomyia reeksi, and C. piniinopis), scale insects (Nuculaspis california, Chionaspis pinifoliae, and Toumeyella parvicornis), spittlebugs (Aphrophora parallela and A. saratogensis), and a wooly aphid (Pineus coloradensis). The jack pine tip beetle (Conophthorus banksianae) causes extensive shoot tip mortality, preferring sapling-size trees. The lodgepole terminal weevil (Pissodes terminalis) attacks and destroys the new terminal bud of jack pine in Saskatchewan (61,83). Several sawflies attack jack pine. Trees are often killed because the sawflies feed on both old and new needles. The pine tussock moth (Parorgyia plagiata) commonly defoliates large areas of sapling- and pole-size jack pine. The jack pine budworm is the most important defoliator of jack pine in the northeastern United States (61,84). Several diseases commonly attack young jack pines and reduce survival and growth. A needle rust fungus (Coleosporium asterum) causes some defoliation of seedlings. Diplodia blight (Diplodia pinea) frequently results in a shoot blight of jack pine seedlings under nursery conditions. Sirococcus shoot blight (Sirococcus strobilinus) has also caused seedling losses in Lake States nurseries. Scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina) causes serious losses in both nursery stock and young plantations. Before nursery control programs for this disease were instituted in the Lake States, this fungus killed an average of 40 percent of seedlings in plantations established with infected stock (77). Jack pine is susceptible to a number of rust fungi that cause both growth loss and tree mortality. Many of these rusts are disseminated by infected nursery stock. The sweetfern blister rust (Cronartium comptoniae) sometimes kills many young seedlings and reduces the growth of survivors. More prevalent is the pine-oak (eastern) gall rust (Cronartium quercuum), which may infect up to 50 percent of young seedlings, killing many of the seedlings with galls on the main stem. Young jack pine in Minnesota have been severely cankered by stalactiform rust (Cronartium coleosporioides). In recent years the pine-to-pine (western) gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii) has been found throughout the Lake States in young jack pine stands. The importance of this rust is its potentially rapid rate of spread. This rust can infect directly from pine to pine without spending parts of its life cycle on an alternate host as do all the previously mentioned rusts (77). Sapling- and pole-size jack pine frequently show severe needlecast (Davisomycella ampla). This fungus often causes loss of all but the current year's needles. Although affected trees suffer growth loss, the disease seldom causes mortality. Diplodia blight frequently kills branches and often the entire tree. This disease appears to be stress related and may reach epidemic status following drought. The European strain of scleroderris canker is currently killing many jack pine in northern New York and will cause serious losses if it reaches the major range of jack pine (77). The rust fungi mentioned under seedling disease also cause extensive mortality in pole-size stands. The pine-oak (eastern) gall rust has caused severe losses in jack pine stands in northern Wisconsin. In some pole-size stands the disease is so prevalent that the stands have become worthless and have been destroyed (77). The major root-rot fungi include the shoestring fungus (Armillaria mellea) and annosum root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) (77). The principal wood decay organisms are Phellinus pini, Phaeolus schweinitzii, and Fomitopsis pinicola (77). Windthrow is not a serious problem in jack pine stands except on shallow soils or when more than one-third of the stand basal area is removed in thinnings. Stem breakage from wind, ice, and snow is more common (10). Cone and seed production can be decreased by numerous factors. Red squirrels and other rodents destroy cones and consume seeds (18,61,69,72). Low-vigor trees may produce much pollen but little seed. Pine-oak (eastern) gall rust damages trees resulting in smaller and aborted ovulate cones. Birds may be important consumers of jack pine seeds that fall to the ground or are directly sown (61). Cone and seed insects may cause serious losses. In one study in northeastern Wisconsin, numerous insect species were found attacking conelets and cones (57). The jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus) destroyed 12 percent of the conelets. A mirid (Platylygus luridus) was observed piercing conelets as well as shoots and needles and was apparently responsible for a severe but unknown conelet abortion rate. The most prevalent insect attacking cones was the cone borer (Eucosma monitorana) which killed 10 percent of the cones. Other insects responsible for a total of about 4 percent cone mortality were the webbing coneworm (Dioryctria disclusa), red pine cone beetle (Conophthorus resinosae), jack pine budworm, and cone midges (Lestodiplosis graddator, Resseliella silvana, and Asynapta hopkinsi) (57). Other insects that directly damage jack pine conelets, cones, or seeds, or that decrease their numbers by damaging potential cone-bearing shoots include the jack pine tip beetle (Conophthorus banksianae), shield-backed pine seed bug (Tetyra bipunctata), Virginia pine sawfly (Neodiprion pratti pratti), a moth (Holcocera immaculella), eastern pine seedworm (Laspeyresia toreuta), Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana), European pine shoot moth (R. buoliana), fir coneworm (Dioryctria abietivorella), and spruce coneworm (D. reniculelloides) (36).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,14,1
"Jack pine is usually found on sandy soils of the Spodosol and Entisol soil orders (81). It also grows on loamy soils, on thin soils over the granites and metamorphosed rocks of the Canadian Shield, over limestones, on peats, and on soil over permafrost (16,61,74). Jack pine can grow on very dry sandy or gravelly soils where other species can scarcely survive, but it grows best on well drained loamy sands where the midsummer water table is from 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) below the surface. Jack pine does not grow naturally where the surface soil is alkaline, but it does grow on soils overlying limestone. It can grow on calcareous soils (pH 8.2) if a normal mycorrhizal association is present. In southeastern New Brunswick, owing to a long fire history, jack pine occupies vast areas of clayey soils and it is more common than red pine on xeric sites that have high nutrient levels (61). In well stocked stands in Minnesota and central Wisconsin, available moisture-holding capacity in the upper 30 cm (12 in) ranges from 3 to 17 percent by weight. Site index improves with an increase in fine sand and silt and clay in the upper soil layer, an increase in water-holding capacity (up to a point after which it levels off), and an increase in cation exchange capacity in the A and B horizons (61). Similar relations between these soil factors and site index were found for plantations in Wisconsin (82). In a jack pine forest in northeastern Minnesota about 2580 to 3140 kg/ha (2,300 to 2,800 lb/acre) ovendry weight of organic matter was returned to the soil annually. The quantity of nutrient elements, expressed in percentage of dry weight, in freshly fallen jack pine litter averages as follows: calcium, 0.61; potassium, 0.16; phosphorus, 0.04; nitrogen, 0.58; and ash, 4.15. The litter is acid with a pH of 3.8 to 4.3 (61). Accumulated biomass of vegetation in jack pine stands more than 50 years old in northeastern Minnesota was 89 000 kg/ha (79,400 lb/acre) on shallow soils over bedrock, and 152 800 kg/ha (136,300 lb/acre) on deep till soils. Biomass of the forest floor was 35 200 kg/ha (31,400 lb/acre) on shallow soils and 50 300 kg/ha (44,870 lb/acre) on deep till soils. Nutrients in the vegetation, forest floor, and soil were similarly higher on the deep till soils (33). The above values largely agree with those found on other sites for jack pine forest floor biomass, litter fall, and nutrient transfer from jack pine forest to soil (28,49,78). In the Lake States and Canada, jack pine grows most commonly on level to gently rolling sand plains, usually of glacial outwash, fluvial, or lacustrine origin. It occurs less commonly on eskers, sand dunes, rock outcrops, and bald rock ridges. In the Lake States jack pine is found chiefly at elevations between 300 and 460 m (1,000 and 1,500 ft), with a maximum of about 610 m (2,000 ft) above sea level. In the East, jack pine grows on a variety of sandy sites from near sea level up to about 610 m (2,000 ft), with an outlier in New Hampshire at 760 m (2,500 ft) (61).",Soils and Topography,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,15,1
"The most notable special use for jack pine is as a breeding area for the Kirtland's warbler, a rare and endangered species. The Kirtland's warbler requires homogeneous stands of jack pine between 1.5 and 6 m (5 to 20 ft) tall (about 7 to 20 years old); stands are preferably larger than 32 ha (80 acres) (52). Jack pine stands can be an important part of the visual resource for recreation areas; they stabilize watersheds, produce areas for blueberry picking, and provide food and shelter for wild game species, including the snowshoe hare and the white-tailed deer (10).",Special Uses,Jack Pine,pinus,banksiana,conifer,16,1
"Incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) is the most widespread associate of Jeffrey pine on ultramafic soils. Locally prominent are Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), ponderosa pine, sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), western white pine (P. monticola), knob-cone pine (P. attenuata), Digger pine (P. sabiniana), and Sargent cypress (Cupressus sargentii). Above 1600 m (5,250 ft) in the Klamath Mountains, North Coast Range, and northern Sierra Nevada, Jeffrey pine shares various soils and sites with California red fir (Abies magnifica), white fir (A. concolor), sugar pine, incense-cedar, western white pine, and Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana). South of the Pit River in northeastern California and on the east side of the Cascade Range in southwestern Oregon and northern California, Jeffrey and ponderosa pines form extensive forests and usually intermingle in both closed and open, parklike stands. Jeffrey pine forests range widely from 1520 to 2130 m (5,000 to 7,000 ft) of elevation in the northern Sierra Nevada, and from 1830 to 2900 m (6,000 to 9,500 ft) in the central and southern Sierra Nevada. Ponderosa pine, sugar pine, white fir, incense-cedar, California red fir, western white pine, lodgepole pine, and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) all mix in locally, but few of them join Jeffrey pine on south slopes and granitic soils (9,44). Jeffrey pine is the dominant yellow pine in forests east of the Sierra Nevada crest and in the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges into Baja California. In the Sierra San Pedro Martir, it ranges from 1830 to 3050 m (6,000 to 10,000 ft) and shares the southern limits of sugar pine, white fir, incense-cedar, and lodgepole pine (10,45,52). Jeffrey pine forests constitute one of the more unusual forest cover types in western North America (14). Because Jeffrey pine has wide edaphic and elevational ranges in diverse physiographic regions, Jeffrey Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 247) is highly variable and adjoins or merges with many others: Red Fir (Type 207), White Fir (Type 211), Lodgepole Pine (Type 218), Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Port-Orford-Cedar (Type 231), Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234), Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237), Western Juniper (Type 238), Pinyon-Juniper (Type 239), Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243), Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244), Knob-cone Pine (Type 248), Canyon Live Oak (Type 249), and California Mixed Subalpine (Type 256). Associated understory species are diverse, reflecting climatic influences (14, p. 123).",Associated Forest Cover,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,1,1
"Jeffrey pine grows well in diverse temperature regimes. Cold winters largely distinguish its range east of the Sierra-Cascade crest from that in the Klamath Mountains, western Sierra Nevada, and southern California. Most populations east of the crest are exposed to January mean minima between -13° and -5° C (8° and 23° F), while those in the west and south are between -7° and 2° C (19° and 36° F). Summer nights are warmer and differences in day-night temperatures are smaller for Jeffrey pine in the western Sierra Nevada and southern California than elsewhere in the range. July day-night differences in these regions are as little as 11° C (20° F), and rarely exceed 19° C (34° F). In the Klamath Mountains and east of the Sierra-Cascade crest, July day-night differences mostly exceed 19° C (34° F), approach 26° C (47° F) in some areas, and decrease to 13° C (24° F) only for stands at highest elevations. Throughout the range, precipitation falls mostly during the winter season. Mean annual rainfall averages as little as 380 to 430 mm (15 to 17 in) in places east of the Sierra-Cascade crest, is only 200 mm. (8 in) for certain stands scattered along the eastern Sierra Nevada and Virginia Range of western Nevada (3), and exceeds 1270 to 1520 mm (50 to 60 in) in parts of the western Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains. Mean snowfall in Jeffrey pine localities typically ranges from 30 cm (12 in) or less at lowest elevations in the Klamath Mountains to well over 520 cm (204 in) at high elevations in the Sierra Nevada, particularly along the central crest.",Climate,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,2,1
Jeffrey pine is genetically variable. Estimates of the average number of alleles and average heterozygosity per enzyme locus show its allelic variation is high (7).,Genetics,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,7,1
"In certain stands, Jeffrey pine is known to hybridize with ponderosa pine (23) and Coulter pine (60), but most mixed stands contain no morphological evidence of genetic intermingling. Natural hybrids are rare because these pines differ substantially in flowering time (12) and cross only with difficulty (8). Under controlled conditions, Jeffrey pine will cross with either ponderosa pine or Coulter pine (32,41), but crossability is very low in either combination. With Jeffrey pine as the female parent, 40 percent of the strobili dusted with ponderosa pollen may produce cones, and 3 percent of the seeds may be sound; with Coulter pollen, the expected percentages are 61 and 3 (8). Observed crossing barriers include failure of viable pollen to germinate on the nucellus, failure of pollen tubes to maintain normal growth rates in the nucellus, lack of exact timing between tube growth and egg formation, collapse of the proembryo, and failure of the embryo to develop. In both crosses, slow growth of the pollen tube appears to be the most common barrier to development of hybrid seeds (29). Although hybrids of Jeffrey and ponderosa pines are rare in the upper Mixed Conifer Forest and in sympatric distributions east of the Sierra-Cascade crest, hybrids may be locally common on ultramafic soils in the western Sierra Nevada. Of 13 mature Jeffrey pines sampled on an ultramafic soil in Sierra County, CA, 12 had the expected 95 to 99 percent heptane, but one had 75 percent heptane and 7 to 8 percent each of alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and limonene, which indicate ponderosa pine ancestry (50). Beneath overstories of Jeffrey pine on ultramafic soil in Placer County, CA, individual saplings and poles show a diverse mix of morphological traits, suggesting that the pollen parents were ponderosa pines growing on the same soil or in mixed conifer forests nearby. Capitalizing on Coulter pine's immunity to the pine reproduction weevil, the Forest Service produced backcrosses of Jeffrey-Coulter hybrids to Jeffrey pine on a large scale for many years (8). The weevil is controllable silviculturally, however, and in recent years the demand for backcross seedlings has ceased.",Hybrids,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,9,1
"Our present understanding of Jeffrey pine's life history is probably limited, because most studies have concentrated on populations in northern California.",Life History,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,10,1
"Primarily a California species, Jeffrey pine ranges north through the Klamath Mountains into southwestern Oregon, across the Sierra Nevada into western Nevada, and south in the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges into northern Baja California (10,20). This distribution is intimately linked with edaphic factors in the northwest portion of the range and strongly reflects climatic and elevational factors in the northeast, central, and southern portions. Jeffrey pine thrives in comparatively harsh environments throughout most of its range (1,21,24,55,58). Contrasted with ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine completes annual top growth sooner, enters dormancy earlier, and requires longer cold exposure for leader growth in spring (27). Because Jeffrey pine is especially cold hardy (21,22), tolerant of drought (51,58,59), and adapted to short growing seasons, it competes well and typically dominates other conifers on cold, xeric, and infertile sites. - The native range of Jeffrey pine.",Native Range,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,11,1
"Jeffrey pine displays large differences in seedling and sapling growth, and in most nurseries seed source largely determines seedling size. When raised in a nursery in the western Sierra Nevada, dormant seedlings of Jeffrey pine from east of the Sierra Nevada crest develop top growth capacity earlier in winter than sources from the western Sierra and southern California. At the same time, seedlings of all sources from east of the crest and southern California show two separate peaks in root growth capacity: November and January for the eastern Sierra, and December and February or March for southern California. The depression between peaks can be deep or shallow and span 1 or 2 months. By contrast, seedlings from ultramafic soil in the western Sierra show a single peak in midwinter (27). Growth in young plantations markedly depends on seed source. In the North Coast Range, stem volumes of 20-year-old Jeffrey pine from five sources in the northern Sierra Nevada differed by up to twofold (6). Trees with least growth were from seed parents near 2230 m (7,300 ft), and those with most growth from parents on ultramafic soil near 1050 m (3,450 ft). Trees from parents at the highest elevation, at 2510 m (8,235 ft) near the Sierra crest, were notably larger than trees from 1770, 1920, and 2230 m (5,800, 6,300, and 7,300 ft). In the western Sierra Nevada, performance of 20-year-old Jeffrey pine improved with the match between seed source and planting site elevation (5). At low elevations, trees from 1050 m (3,450 ft) were taller and had less stem taper than trees from 2400 m (7,860 ft). At high elevations, mortality was 30 percent in the low elevation source, as against 2 percent in high elevation sources. Trees of high elevation sources were 1. 1 to 1.6 m (3.6 to 5.2 ft) taller, and fewer than 10 percent suffered breaks in the main stem, compared with 27 percent in the low elevation source. Data at hand are not sufficient to describe the rangewide pattern of genetic variation in the growth of Jeffrey pine. Definitive data are probably years away, because early growth of Jeffrey pine depends on specific interactions between the seed source and planting site environment. Until rotation-age tests of particular sources on specific sites indicate otherwise, planting any Jeffrey pine of a nonlocal source is unwise. Nonlocal sources are probably maladapted, yet may not show it until sometime during or after the pole stage. There is good evidence that some Jeffrey pine may be resistant to dwarf mistletoe infection (47,57).",Population Differences,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- In California, Jeffrey pine flowers in June or July, depending on the climatic region, elevation, aspect, and annual variation in temperature (12). The species is monoecious. Female strobili emerge from the bud shortly after the male strobili. After pollination, the conelets develop slowly, reaching less than one-fifth the size of mature cones the first growing season. Fertilization occurs about 13 months after pollination, and the cones grow rapidly to reach full size in summer of the second season. Unripe cones are pale or dark purple to black and shade to light brown or dull purple at maturity. Seeds are mature when cone specific gravity (fresh weight basis) drops to between 0.81 and 0.86; they are safely collected in stands where one or two trees have cones that are cracking, with seed scales separating. Mature cones are usually 13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 in) long, open to resemble old-fashioned straw beehives or skeps, and normally shed most of their seeds in September or October (30). Seed Production and Dissemination- Although trees as young as 8 years have borne a cone crop, typical cone-bearing Jeffrey pines are 18 to 55 m (60 to 180 ft) tall and produce a large seed crop every 2 to 8 years (30). When shed, the winged seeds drop about 2.2 m/s (7.2 ft/s) (49), indicating that winds of 8 km/h (5 mi/h) carry them no further than the height of seedfall. Seeds can be widely spread, however. Fall storms are common in California's mountains, and winds average 13 to 26 km/h (8 to 16 mi/h) in September and October. Gusts occasionally exceed 64 to 113 km/h (40 to 70 mi/h), enough to blow seeds up to 15 times the height of seedfall, even 750 m (2,460 ft) from a tree height of 50 m (164 ft). Besides wind, certain seed eaters also disseminate seeds. In the Sierra Nevada, Clark's nutcracker harvests and stores substantial quantities of ripe Jeffrey pine seeds, burying them in many small clusters in a wide variety of microsites, and often where snow accumulates least and melts rapidly in spring (54). At least eight other common birds also extract and eat seeds of Jeffrey pine. Several kinds of squirrels cut and store large quantities of Jeffrey cones for their seeds, including the widespread golden-mantled ground squirrel and western gray squirrel. The chickaree cuts whole cones and buries them in the ground, and chipmunks harvest seeds by gnawing cones in the tree. Mice and voles efficiently gather, cache, and consume large quantities of shed seed. Like seeds of most pines in temperate climates, Jeffrey pine germinates quickly the spring after seedfall. For starting new stands after harvest, however, natural regeneration is seldom quick and never reliable. The usual cause of failure is vegetation in the original understory that simply preempts the site. Irregular seed crops, poor seed dissemination, seed predators, cutworms, pathogens, mammals, and drought are also lethal factors (16,25). Seedling Development- Mature seeds show highly variable degrees of dormancy after air drying and cold storage. Different seed sources require different amounts of moist, cold stratification for rapid and complete germination (30). Although certain sources east of the Sierra-Cascade crest may not require pretreatment, stored seeds of most sources germinate best after 60 days of stratification. In forest tree nurseries in northern California and southern Oregon, seeds are sown in April to utilize the full growing season. Germination is epigeal (30). Stratified seeds are sown above a maximum depth of 6 to 8 mm (0.25 to 0.30 in) and at a density to produce 269 to 323 seedlings per square meter (25 to 30/ft²) . Fertilization and irrigation regimes are tailored to seedling requirements in the particular nursery soil and climate. For most sources west of the Sierra-Cascade crest and in southern California, seedlings of plantable size are raised in one growing season. For many sources east of the crest, seedlings are often carried through two seasons. To consistently raise large and healthy seedlings of Jeffrey pine, nursery soil management is crucial. In midsummer, dry, fallow soil is ripped deeply enough to restore rapid drainage and aeration, and then fumigated. Fumigation is necessary to control nematodes, root rots such as Rhizoctonia, Phytophthora, Pythium, Macrophomina, and Fusarium spp., and foliar diseases such as Phoma and Sirococcus (38). Jeffrey pine is quickly established in the field when dormant seedlings are lifted from nursery beds at the right time in winter, held in cold storage, planted at the right time in spring, and protected against animal damage and competing vegetation. Lifted seedlings are root-pruned 23 cm (9 in) below the cotyledon scars and stored in polyethylene-lined bags at 1° C (34° F). Planting starts at the onset of spring conditions, when soils warm sufficiently to permit water uptake and root growth. Planting is ideally completed before the last spring rain to ensure that roots will be sealed in the soil. In the Sierra Nevada, field survivals of 90 to 99 percent are attainable on cleared sites within the species' elevational range (27). Vegetative Reproduction- Jeffrey pine does not sprout.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- In field plantations, Jeffrey pine grows less rapidly than ponderosa pine during the sapling stage, but more rapidly in the pole stage. Jeffrey pine has trailed ponderosa pine in height growth through more than 5 years in the northern Sierra Nevada in Plumas County, CA (15), 6 years in the Warner Mountains in Modoc County, CA (35), and 11 years in the western Sierra Nevada in Stanislaus County, CA (table 1). After 5 years in the Plumas test, every stock class of Jeffrey pine gradually overtook its ponderosa counterpart, averaging 127 cm (50 in) tall and exceeding ponderosa pine by 5 percent 9 years after planting (15). In the Stanislaus plantation, Jeffrey pine accelerated growth into the pole stage, increasing height by one-fourth at 10 years, and at 20 years had nearly overtaken ponderosa pine in both height and diameter (table 1). Leader length at 20 years was 14 percent greater for Jeffrey pine, indicating that the species' difference might soon be eliminated. In the Modoc plantation, trees averaged 5 m (16.5 ft) tall and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter when thinned at 30 years (34,35). At thinning and for the next 15 years, the growth of these poles was apparently the same for both species. When seedlings of Jeffrey and ponderosa pines from the Sierra Nevada were planted at 560 m (1,830 ft) in the North Coast Range in Mendocino County, CA, the Jeffrey pines outgrew ponderosa pines from comparable elevations, edging them in both height and diameter in 17 years (6). Jeffrey pine may live 400 to 500 years and on the best sites can reach an impressive size. Trees larger than 152 cm (60 in) in d.b.h. were often measured in virgin forests east and west of the Sierra-Cascade crest. The largest known survivor is on the Stanislaus National Forest in the western Sierra Nevada and measures 229 cm (90 in) in diameter and 53 m (175 ft) tall (36). Yellow pines taller than 61 m (200 ft) are recorded in early volume table measurements, and some of them probably are Jeffrey pine (24). Several general accounts state that Jeffrey pines 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) in diameter and 52 to 61 m (170 to 200 ft) tall were typical of the species' best growth on deep, coarse-textured and well-drained soils (28,45,52). Stands of similar description may still be seen in the high country of Yosemite National Park. By contrast, stand productivity is low for Jeffrey pine on ultramafic soils. Dunning's site index (base age 300 years) may often be as high as 29 m (95 ft), but the typical stocking capacity is just 11 to 28 percent of normal basal area (33). Yield data have never been acquired specifically for Jeffrey pine, but Jeffrey pine apparently grows to the same age and maximum size as ponderosa pine. Observations in mature natural stands bolster the belief that yield data for ponderosa pine can be confidently applied to pure stands of Jeffrey pine, or to Jeffrey pine mixed with ponderosa pine (24,25). Rooting Habit- Windthrow is rare for Jeffrey pine. Surveys of windthrow sales indicate that Jeffrey pine is seldom included and is highly windfirm compared with its timber associates. In juvenile through mature stages, Jeffrey pine typically has a deep taproot. The primary lateral roots are strong and extensive, some growing horizontally and others angling downward. Such root systems apparently adjust well to the physical and chemical environments encountered. In an open stand of Jeffrey pine on a shallow ultramafic soil in the northern Sierra Nevada, live roots up to 5 cm (2 in) in diameter were encountered in soil pits up to 30 m (100 ft) away from the nearest trees, at distances greater than tree height. Reaction to Competition- Jeffrey pine occasionally regenerates beneath open, overmature stands, but growth is checked until the overstory is removed. The species is intolerant of shade, and root competition from old-growth trees is intense. In such circumstances, saplings 40 or more years old and less than 1 m (3 ft) tall are common. After release, suppressed saplings take 3 to 7 years to extend root systems, produce efficient crowns, and begin rapid height growth (24). As a result of wildfire, stagnated sapling stands of naturally regenerated Jeffrey and ponderosa pines are common in the 1.6 million ha (4 million acres) of yellow pine forests in northeastern California. Densities have sometimes reached 42,000 stems per hectare (17,000/acre). Growth is so slow that stand development virtually ceases, yet dominants and codominants can respond to thinning. In one 55-year-old stand with 27,200 stems per hectare (11,000/acre), thinning 2.5-m (8.2-ft) tall saplings to a spacing of 2.7 m (9 ft) tripled their periodic radial growth and increased height growth 67 percent in 5 years, compared with unthinned controls (53). Survival and growth of planted Jeffrey pine reflects the thoroughness of site preparation and post-planting protection against aggressive understory plants (42,43). Heavy invasion of any vegetation soon after planting makes seedling survival unlikely, if not impossible. Brush, grasses, and sedges all are lethal competition for available soil water in Jeffrey pine's dry summer environments, and many shrub species quickly overtop and markedly slow the growth of surviving seedlings. Low vegetation even reduces the growth of established Jeffrey pine. In northeastern California, removing perennial bunchgrass and sedge, alone or together with sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), increased the mean 5-year basal area increment of pine poles by as much as 38 percent (18). Damaging Agents- Extremely low temperatures can kill needles, buds, last season's shoots, and even the inner bark of Jeffrey pine. East of the Sierra Nevada crest, winter minima between -35° and -43° C (-31° and -45° F) have extensively damaged Jeffrey pine. Trees whose inner bark was destroyed by freezing were killed (56). Jeffrey pine may also undergo severe physiological drought and foliar damage in winter, when sunny and warm or windy days desiccate needles of trees rooted in soils that are too cold for adequate water uptake. Jeffrey pine is highly sensitive to anaerobic conditions and is killed outright when root systems are flooded by beaver ponds or new stream channels or are buried under fill from land grading operations (2). Human activity is often damaging in other ways. Highway de-icing salts (48), sewage effluents (2), and air pollutants such as ozone (39) all may severely injure or kill Jeffrey pine. Like other conifers, Jeffrey pine is susceptible to herbicide damage at certain seasons of the year and stages of growth (40). Spraying during the growing season may kill trees or distort growth of new shoots, although observations in plantations suggest that Jeffrey pine resists phenoxy herbicide damage. Among the biotic agents attacking Jeffrey pine are two needle diseases, a limb canker, at least five different rusts, western dwarf mistletoe, three major root diseases, and various heart rots (2). Elytroderma disease (Elytroderma deformans) has reached epidemic proportions in stands into which cold air drains and has reduced growth and killed trees for years after major outbreaks (46). Medusa needle blight (Davisomycella medusa) has markedly decreased growth of individual trees, especially on poor sites after drought. Cenangium limb canker (Cenangium ferruginosum) may severely attack young trees growing under poor conditions and usually kills suppressed or weakened branches. Stalactiform rust (Peridermium stalactiforme) infects lower limbs and spreads upward in the crowns of young Jeffrey pine; infected trees are almost always near the alternate hosts, particularly Castilleja spp. Filamentosum rust (Peridermium filamentosum) kills the middle or upper crowns of scattered mature trees, can spread from pine to pine, and has displayed a potential for intense outbreaks. Sweetfern rust (Cronartium comptoniae) frequently kills young trees, and tarweed rust (Coleosporium madiae) may cause heavy defoliation in occasional wet years. Western gall rust (Peridermium harknessii) kills seedlings and large trees of Jeffrey pine by producing abundant, globose branch galls or large bole-deforming stem cankers. Although its major outbreaks are often decades apart, this rust is ubiquitous in California and potentially hazardous to young Jeffrey pine in moderately cool, humid environments (2). The worst disease of Jeffrey pine is caused by western dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium campylopodum). Heavy infections cause witches' brooms, severely reduce growth, and eventually kill the tree. Young trees are highly susceptible to infection from surrounding infected overstory trees (37). Dwarf mistletoe has predisposed many stands to insect attack and has induced 60 to 80 percent of all Jeffrey pine mortality in years of severe drought (4). Fungal diseases of the roots of Jeffrey pine include annosus (Heterobasidion annosum), armillaria (Armillaria mellea), and black stain (Verticicladiella wagnerii). Fungi that cause heart rots in Jeffrey pine include species of Lentinus, Fomes, and Polyporus. In southern California, red rot (Dichomitus squalens) attacks Jeffrey pine through broken tops, bole wounds, and large dead limbs (2). Insects that damage Jeffrey pine are as numerous as the fungal diseases. Collectively attacking every part of the tree, they include twig and needle scales, various defoliators, borers, and tip moths, several bark beetles, and a host of cone and seed feeders (17). The ponderosa pine twig scale (Matsucoccus bisetosus) feeds on branches and stems of trees of all ages and is the most destructive of the scales. Two of the more serious defoliators are the pine needle sheathminer (Zelleria haimbachi) and pandora moth (Coloradia pandora). Larvae of the sheathminer have destroyed more than 75 percent of the new needles in localized outbreaks in California. Larvae of the pandora moth are among the largest of any forest insect and consume whole needles in spring before bud break. Extensive outbreaks occur every 20 to 30 years, cause heavy defoliation for 2 to 4 years, and predispose the trees to attack by bark beetles and borers. The western pineshoot borer (Eucosma sonomana) stunts the needles and retards height growth of young trees by as much as 30 percent annually. The ponderosa pine tip moth (Rhyacionia zozana) kills current shoots of saplings and young trees up to 2 m (6 ft) tall and may chronically retard growth for many years. The fir coneworm (Dioryctria abietivorella) kills the terminal buds of saplings and poles and frequently causes a permanent fork in the main stem. Larvae of the pine reproduction weevil (Cylindrocopturus eatoni) can destroy saplings and young trees where brush competition causes severe water stress. The Jeffrey pine beetle (Dendroctonus jeffreyi) is the single worst enemy of Jeffrey pine (13). This bark beetle is prevalent throughout the range of its host, and has caused staggering losses of timber in mature stands. Several other insects that attack the main stem commonly precede or accompany Jeffrey pine beetle, notably the California flatheaded borer (Melanophila californica) and two pine engravers, the emarginate ips (Ips emarginatus) and Oregon pine engraver (I. pini, or I. oregonis). The red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) also attacks injured or weakened Jeffrey pine and induces fatal attacks by other bark beetles. Throughout California, lethal bark beetle activity is usually associated with dwarf mistletoe infestation or root rots, indicating that pathogens predispose the trees to insect attacks (4). Insects often cause major losses of Jeffrey pine cones and seeds. The worst of these are the Jeffrey pine seedworm (Laspeyresia injectiva) and ponderosa pine seedworm (L. piperana), which eat seeds within the immature cone (17,26). Deer, jack rabbits and snowshoe hares, pocket gophers, porcupines, and domestic livestock damage and kill young Jeffrey pine. Resident, mobile populations of these mammals make substantial losses likely in most areas. Pocket gophers consume whole seedlings, feed on the roots, stem, and crown of saplings, and often annihilate young plantations (11). Porcupines commonly eat the inner bark and cambium of saplings and poles and either kill them outright or cause a spiketop above the girdled stem.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,14,1
"Perhaps one-fifth of the distribution of Jeffrey pine is on ultramafic soils. At middle elevations on the western slope of the northern Sierra Nevada and in the North Coast Range and Klamath Mountains, Jeffrey pine often dominates and is almost entirely restricted to soils derived from ultramafic rocks- peridotites and their alteration products, serpentinites. The typical forest soils formed on such rocks are fine, fine loamy, and clayey texture skeletal surface soils. On these highly infertile, mostly shallow soils, Jeffrey pine descends to low elevations: 490 m (1,600 ft) in Butte County, 260 m (850 ft) in Humboldt County, 60 m (200 ft) in Del Norte County, CA, and 183 m (600 ft) in Douglas County, OR. The only native Jeffrey pine in California's South Coast Range grows on an isolated mass of sterile serpentine in San Benito County (19). Jeffrey pine's innately short growing season, limited nutrient and water demands, and extensive root growth probably ensure its presence on poor sites. Above 1600 m (5,250 ft) in ultramafic regions and at all elevations everywhere else within its range, Jeffrey pine grows on any well-drained forest soil, regardless of parent material. Most of the usual soils that carry Jeffrey pine are coarse or gravelly sandy loams or loamy coarse sands that often merge with rocklands. Where these soils are of recent volcanic origin (ashes, pumice, or cinders) they are Dystric or Typic Xerorthents or Xeropsamments of the order Entisols. Jeffrey pine characteristically grows on granitic soils in the Sierra Nevada. These soils extend over complex systems of branching ridges, ravines, and canyons at elevations ranging from 1520 to 2740 m (5,000 to 9,000 ft), are usually found in a humid microthermal climate, and vary from about 0.6 to 1.4 m (2 to 5 ft) deep. They are Dystric and Typic Xerochrepts and Xerumbrepts of the order Inceptisols. Volcanic soils and mud flows commonly support Jeffrey pine in the northern Sierra Nevada and adjacent Cascade Range. They are extensive on gentle to steep slopes of dissected plateau-like areas at elevations up to 1830 m (6,000 ft), and most vary from 0.5 to 1 m (1.6 to 3.3 ft) deep (31). They are Ultic, Typic, and Dystric Haploxeralfs of the order Alfisols. East of the Sierra Nevada crest from Lassen to Alpine Counties, CA, and along the Virginia Range of adjacent western Nevada, isolated patches of Jeffrey and ponderosa pines grow on more than 125 islands of altered andesite (3). These edaphically restricted stands range in elevation from 1310 to 2130 m (4,300 to 7,000 ft), and many are within the Pinyon-Juniper woodland (20).",Soils and Topography,Jeffrey Pine,pinus,jeffreyi,conifer,15,1

"Kiawe is usually found in association with koa haole (Leucaena leucocephala), opiuma (Pithecellobium dulce), and klu (Acacia farnesiana). It is sometimes associated with the native tree, wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis), the native shrub, a'alii (Dodonaea viscosa), and the introduced shrub, lantana (Lantana camara).",Associated Forest Cover,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,1,0
"In Hawaii, kiawe is most common in leeward coastal areas that have an annual rainfall of 250 to 760 mm (10 to 30 in) and a mean annual temperature of 24° C (75° F) with a range of 13° to 35° C (55° to 95° F). In a California study (6), kiawe trees less than 3 years old survived -2° C (29° F), but were killed at -6.1° C (21° F). Kiawe rarely extends above 150 m (500 ft) in elevation because higher rainfall and lower temperature give other species competitive advantage. In a few locations, however, it reaches an elevation of about 610 in (2,000 ft). In its native habitat, it is reported to grow from sea level to 300 m (990 ft) in annual rainfall from 250 to 1240 mm (10 to 49 in) (11). On the Islands of Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Niihau, which are in the lee of larger islands, kiawe occupies both windward and leeward shores extensively. It is present also as a shrub on some windward coasts of all islands. Many old kiawe trees have been saved as garden and park trees during land development and have grown to large sizes with irrigation. Although it is a coastal species, kiawe is defoliated by windblown salt spray of winter storms (3).",Climate,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,2,0
"Because the entire population of kiawe in Hawaii is originally from one tree, inbreeding has been intensive. One possible recessive characteristic of the population is thornlessness. Although most kiawe trees have thorns with strong spines often 2.5 cm (1 in) long, an estimated 25 percent of the mature trees produce only small, hard stipules rather than long, spikelike spines at the twig nodes. The thornless characteristic has been noted for years, and as early as 1937, Hawaii shipped seed from thornless kiawe trees to Cuba, Arabia, Australia, Fiji, and South Africa (3). Attempts have been made to breed for thornlessness, but have so far been unsuccessful. Thornless trees can be propagated by air-layering of mature twigs (13). Some other Prosopis spp. also exhibit thornlessness among individuals in the populations (10). Thomlessness can be seen in some or all of these other species when they are only 3 to 4 months old (4). One report states that Prosopis spp. bear self-incompatible flowers (15). This is obviously not true of Prosopis pallida, or at least of that one individual Prosopis pallida originally introduced into Hawaii. Another report mentions that in 1920, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Experiment Station in Honolulu had imported seed and was growing seedlings of a number of other Prosopis spp. in an attempt to determine the identity of the tree common to Hawaii by comparison (14). No record exists of the disposition of these seedlings, but a possibility exists that they may have been outplanted. No hybrids are known in Hawaii, however. In addition to kiawe, at least five other Prosopis species deserve consideration for use in and lands for firewood, forage, and cover (10). One of these, Prosopis alba, is the backbone of the Arizona nursery shade tree industry (4).",Genetics,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,7,0
"Kiawe is native to the drier parts of Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, especially near the coast. It is naturalized in Hawaii and Puerto Rico (10).",Native Range,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- In Hawaii, kiawe begins to flower when 3 to 4 years old. The tree can flower at any time of the year and frequently flowers twice a year. Usually, it flowers from January to March, but in some years with wet summers it also flowers heavily during September and October. The numerous small perfect flowers are borne in pale yellow spikes 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long and about 13 min (0.5 in) in diameter. Styles protrude from the corolla just before it opens, but when it is opened the style and the 10 stamens are about the same length. Flowers are insect pollinated. Kiawe is an excellent honey tree (3). About 6 months after flowering and pollination, the pods ripen and fall to the ground in April and July, or in normally dry years, only in July. The pods are straight or slightly curved yellowish beans 7 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) long by 8 min (0.3 in) wide; there are 350/kg (160/lb) (18). Seed Production and Dissemination- Pods do not open on drying to release their seed as some other legumes do. Instead, seeds are released either by natural decomposition of the pods or by passage of the seeds through the digestive system of an animal. From 10 to 20 light brown seeds per pod are encased in a sticky, sugary pulp. Seeds are difficult to extract from the pods. It is possible, however, to obtain seed by running pods through a commercial meat grinder with 1-cm (0.4-in) holes (5). There are about 28,500 to 32,000 seeds per kilogram (13,000 to 14,500/lb). The seeds can be stored at ambient room temperature, protected from insects, for 9 months with little loss of viability (18). Germination is improved slightly by scarifying the seeds with hot water before sowing. Scarification with concentrated sulfuric acid for 10 minutes improved germination from 64 percent (without treatment) to 88 percent (18). Many seeds are destroyed by insect pests. In Hawaii, a black beetle, Mimosestes amicus, bores into the pods that have fallen to the ground (16). In Puerto Rico, a Bruchid weevil attacks seed on the tree, causing seed from green pods on the tree to have a germination rate of only 59 percent, yellow pods on the tree only 40 percent, and pods on the ground only 6 percent (18). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Seedlings are usually found associated with animal droppings during and after rainy periods. In this highly fertile situation, seedlings grow rapidly, reaching 0.3 in (1 ft) in 3 to 4 months. Even in the absence of browsing animals, kiawe reproduces prolifically on abandoned city house lots containing older trees. Seedlings in such a situation can grow more than 1 in (3 ft) tall in the first year if rainfall is adequate. Seedling survival depends primarily on sufficient rainfall during 4 to 6 weeks after germination. The seedlings are also intolerant of shade. Vegetative Reproduction- Kiawe stumps often sprout after being cut. Some thornless trees have been propagated by air-layering of the mature branches, but only on an experimental scale. Kiawe cuttings can also be rooted under mist (5).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The oldest kiawe trees in Hawaii of known age are at the entrance to Punahou School in Honolulu. This area was a treeless field in 1848. In 1918, trees on this site that were about 70 years old ranged from 61 to 104 cm (24 to 41 in) in d.b.h. and from 20 to 26 m (65 to 85 ft) in total height (9). This is a relatively wet area for kiawe, with an annual rainfall of 940 mm. (37 in) and abundant groundwater from a nearby spring. At Waianae, Oahu, an area with 510 mm (20 in) annual rainfall, a tract of kiawe trees of unknown age yielded 226.8 m³ per ha (3,240 ft³/acre or 36 cords/acre). On Maui, a 2.4-ha (6-acre) area with 380 mm (15 in) rainfall yielded 365.4 m³ per ha (5,220 ft³/acre or 58 cords/acre) (9). In Puerto Rico, on a dry, gravelly site (760 mm or 30 in rainfall), a 21-year-old planting had trees 25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 in) d.b.h. and 4.6 to 7.6 in (15 to 25 ft) tall (18). In Honolulu, the original tree, when measured in 1916, at 88 years of age, was 99 cm (39 in) in diameter (8). But the champion kiawe tree in Hawaii is at Puako, Island of Hawaii, and measures 130 cm (51 in) d.b.h. and 27.7 in (91 ft) tall (1). In a study of biomass production of other Prosopis spp. in southern California (5), several species, mostly from South America, were grown for 3 years at 1.2 in (4 ft) spacing and three levels of irrigation. These trees produced an annual average of 8.5 t/ha (3.8 tons/acre) of fresh biomass. Another study in Texas (19) determined that Prosopis natural stands yielded 19.3 t/ha (8.6 tons/acre) on deep upland soils and 36.1 t/ha (16.1 tons/acre) on deep bottom land. In Puerto Rico, direct seeding in dry areas (760 mm or 30 in rainfall) gave poor survival, but planting of seedlings produced 67 percent survival despite a severe 6-month drought (18). On windy or dry sites, kiawe grows as a shrub, or a small twisted tree only 3 to 5 in (10 to 16 ft) tall. It is usually layered where it grows in strong trade winds and lies along the slopes as a rounded bush. Rooting Habit- The genus Prosopis is noted for its ability to root deeply (10). A Prosopis uelutina tree in Arizona was found with roots extending downwards 53 in (174 ft) into the ground (10). Kiawe seedlings produce strong, rapidly growing taproots that appear to be capable of deep extension and may share the deep rooting characteristic common to the genus. The species can grow on windy, dry sites, which suggests that its roots penetrate deeply to reach moisture. Trees on such sites are small. Trees on coastal plains where abundant, shallow groundwater is available reach large size, but are shallow-rooted and subject to windthrow (3,9). Reaction to Competition- Kiawe is an intolerant tree and is shaded out by faster growing plants on wet sites. On dry sites the grasses, koa haole, and opuima, with which it commonly associates, remain so sparse that abundant sunlight reaches the kiawe. No silviculture is practiced with kiawe, but the species' characteristics indicate that it could be managed as a fuelwood crop. It fixes nitrogen, so requires less fertilizer than nonleguminous trees, and it coppices after cutting, so does not require replanting at each rotation. It is a short-boled, crooked tree even when grown at close spacing and appears unsuitable for use as a timber tree. Damaging Agents- Kiawe trees are severely defoliated by the introduced caterpillar Melipotis indomita but quickly leaf out again after defoliation (17). They are also sometimes partially defoliated by the Blackburn butterfly, Vaga blackburni, an insect that usually does more damage to other legumes (16). In California, a psyllid, Alphalaroida spp., caused leafroll of new leaflets in plants grown in a glasshouse (6). The kiawe roundheaded borer, Placosternus crinicornis, infects trees under stress, and recently cut firewood, boring under the bark and into the sapwood (18). Carpenter bees seem to have a particular affinity for the sapwood of kiawe fence posts. The tree grows in areas where fire hazard is often extreme. It is usually killed outright by fire and burned trees almost never sprout.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,14,0
"Kiawe grows well on the soils that form on the and or semiarid coastal lands of leeward Hawaii. It is also very tolerant of saline soils (11). The soils where it grows in Hawaii are primarily Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Vertisols. The Inceptisols are in the great group Eutrandepts (reddish-brown latosols) developed from basaltic rock or ash. The Mollisols are Haplustolls (low humic latosols) developed from basaltic material and alluvium. The Vertisols are Chromusterts (dark magnesium clays) developed from alluvium and coral limestone and Torrerts developed from olivine basalt. These soils are mostly neutral to moderately alkaline in reaction, frequently stony to very stony, and occupy level to moderately steep coastal lands. In the driest locations, such as the eastern slopes of the Island of Lanai, kiawe is confined to the gully bottoms. Elsewhere, it extends onto ridges.",Soils and Topography,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,15,0
"Kiawe is used principally as a cover tree for erosion control on and land. As recently as 1915, it was considered the most valuable tree in Hawaii for a variety of other reasons. Its pods and seed are nutritious fodder. The pods alone contain 9 percent protein and the seeds 34 percent, one of the highest levels for any legume. But because the seed coats are indigestible, the seeds must be ground, if animals are to recover this protein. In 1935, Hawaii shipped more than 200 tons of kiawe honey. A small honey industry in Hawaii continues to depend on kiawe (3,6,9). The wood is extremely hard and heavy. It is used directly for fuel and also is made into charcoal. The heartwood is durable and kiawe is preferred for fence posts despite its crooked form. Mesquite, a related species in the United States, is the traditional wood used for boatbuilders' calking mallets and, in Hawaii, kiawe is referred for cement floats.",Special Uses,Kiawe,prosopis,pallida,hardwood,16,0
"Botanists and foresters have listed more than 80 trees, shrubs, vines, herbs, ferns, club mosses, grasses, and sedges associated with koa.

"Hawaii is tropical in latitude, with mild and equable temperatures at low elevations (table 1). Day length is nearly uniform year-round, varying by 2 hours. The northeasterly trade winds dominate; however, ""Kona"" storms from the south or west during winter, and occasional tropical storms throughout the year, bring high winds and heavy rains to the islands. Hawaii's mountains, especially massive Mauna Loa and Manna Kea on Hawaii, and Haleakala on Maui, have a strong influence on the weather and provide climates ranging from the tropic to the subarctic (7). Table 1-Mean temperature at five stations on the east flank of Mauna Kea, island of Hawaii¹ ¹Data on file at the Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Honolulu, HI. Rainfall varies greatly within short distances. Monthly amounts recorded over a period of years at weather stations in the koa belts show a phenomenal range. A Forest Service station at 1200 m (4,000 ft) elevation recorded a mean annual rainfall of 4300 mm (170 in) for a 14-year period, with extremes of 3450 to 5500 mm (136 to 216 in). During the driest month, only 19 mm (0.74 in) was recorded; the wettest month was 1380 mm (54.4 in). Koa grows best in the high rainfall areas, those receiving 1900 to 5100 mm (75 to 200 in) annually. It also grows in areas that receive much less than this amount, but growth is slower and tree form is generally poorer. Cloud cover and fog commonly shroud the middle forest zone (600 to 1800 m or 2,000 to 6,000 ft) where commercial koa stands are concentrated. Frost is not uncommon during winter months above 1200 m (4,000 ft) elevation. Temperature ranges within the koa belt are small, as may be seen from data for Mauna Kea, island of Hawaii (table 1).",Climate,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,2,0
"Morphological differences in koa have been observed on several islands. In 1920, Rock (63), named two varieties: Acacia koa var. lanaiensis (Hillebrand's A. koa-B var.) and A. koa var. hawaiiensis, after the islands on which they were found. Ecotypic variation can be found from island to island. Studies of such variation are complicated by past plantings of mixed seed lots collected throughout the islands; such mixed plantings could now be hybridizing. Collections of the koa group, all commonly referred to as koa, were studied, and in 1979 this classification was presented by St. John (90): Acacia koa var. koa, grows on the six larger is-lands. Acacia koa var. waianacensis grows only on Oahu, and most commonly in the Waianae Mountains. Acacia koa var. latifolia; syn. A. koa var. hawaiiensis Rock, grows on the island of Hawaii in the rain forest, and at higher elevations on the more open ranch and park land. Altitudinal races of koa probably exist (52). Two other native species related to koa are recognized. On western Kauai, one of the oldest Hawaiian Islands, a form of acacia is found that differs from koa in sepals, petals, inflorescence (63), and seed shape (37). This species, also called koa, is Acacia kauaiensis. A second species closely related to koa is koaia (A. koaia), a narrowly distributed, small, shrubby tree occupying dry, leeward sites below 1050 m (3,500 ft) on Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii (89). Acacia koaia differs from koa in the shape of the pods and phyllodes (63). The native and introduced species of Acacia found on Lanai have been described (20). Other Acacia species related to koa are found outside of Hawaii. Mascarene acacia (A. heterophylla) is endemic to Reunion island and Mauritius island, both about 725 km (450 mi) east of Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean. It is so similar to koa that the trees were initially identified as the same species. The two were identified by another botanist as separate species, however, entirely on the basis of distance and isolation. In 1969, significant differences were found in fruit and seed size, corolla structure, and morphology of the first two leaves of the two species (95). Tasmanian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), native to Australia but planted in many countries, resembles koa. It has straighter and shorter phyllodes, a narrower curved pod, a more pointed crown (63), but similar wood. Another closely related species, A. simplicifolia, grows in Samoa, New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and Fiji (20,59,60). In 1948, one investigator determined that koa is a tetraploid with 2n = 52 and stated that all other phyllodinous acacias studied have the diploid chromosome complement (3). He reasoned ""that polyploidy in Acacia koa occurred after the initiation of phylloidy. This is supported by its distribution as an endemic island extension of the Australian flora."" In 1978, koa was observed to have a gametic number of 26, verifying that it is tetraploid (14). Another investigator (95) reported on the work of Lescanne, who observed that the closely related A. heterophylla was also a tetraploid, with 2n = 52.",Genetics,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,7,0
"Koa is a phyllodial species that undergoes a change from true leaves (consisting of 12 to 15 paired, bipinnate leaflets) to sickle-shaped phyllodes (dilated petioles). In most cases where light is sufficient, the change occurs while plants are smaller than saplings, i.e. < 2 m (6 ft) tall. Investigations suggest that true leaves promote more rapid early growth when moisture is adequate, whereas, during periods of drought, phyllodes are better adapted(27). Phyllodes persist under moisture stress, transpiring about 20 percent as much as true leaves, and their stomata close four times faster after dark (97). Old trees usually bear only laurel green phyllodes, but sometimes true leaves appear on the trunk or lower branches, or after wounding.",Life History,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,10,0
"The range of koa extends from longitude 154° to 160° W; its latitude ranges from 19° to 22° N. It is found on all six of the major islands of the Hawaiian chain: Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai, and Hawaii. -The native range of koa.",Native Range,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting-The flowers of koa are borne over the outer part of the crown. Seedlings have been observed in flower and fruit (3,80) at 2 and 3 years of age. One of the pollinating insects found on koa flowers is the honeybee (Apis mellifera). The extent to which other insects, birds, and wind affect pollination is not well documented. Koa initiates flower development nearly year-round at the high elevation on Mauna Loa, reaching a peak during the wet season in late winter (46). On adjacent Mauna Kea, koa flowers appear from December through February, with few flowers at any other time. At lower elevations, on all of the islands, flowering usually occurs from late winter to early summer (July). Weather conditions, especially severe droughts, influence the timing and extent of flowering at any time of the year. The inflorescence of koa is an axillary raceme of pale yellow heads averaging 8.5 mm (0.3 in) in diameter (29), one to three on a common peduncle, and composed of many hermaphroditic (bisexual) flowers. Each flower has an indefinite number of free stamens and a single elongated style. The heads are highly dichogamous, with anthers dehiscing 3 to 8 days before the stigmas are fully exserted (8). The fruit is a legume, slow to dehisce, about 15 cm (6 in) long and 2.5 to 4 cm (1 to 1.5 in) wide. The pods contain about 12 seeds that vary from dark brown to black. They mature at different times throughout the year, depending on location and weather conditions. Seed Production and Dissemination- No records of the frequency of exceptionally good or poor seed years are available, but seed years do vary. Koa seed pods dehisce while on the tree or fall to the ground unopened, where they either dehisce or disintegrate. ""The horny seed often remains on the tree for a year after it ripens, and when lying on the ground is known to have retained for a period for 25 years its ability to germinate"" (37). Koa seeds are seldom dispersed far beyond the crown, but, occasionally, wind may carry unopened pods some distance. Seeds from koa growing in gulches may be carried downstream to lower elevations, especially during torrential rains. Koa seeds, like those of other acacias, are among the most durable of tree seeds and need not be kept in sealed containers. They will germinate after many years of storage if kept in a cool, dry place. The seeds have hard coats that retard germination unless they are first mechanically scarified, briefly treated with sulfuric acid, or soaked in hot water. The water treatment is the most practical. The seeds are placed in nearly boiling water, after the heat source is removed, and allowed to soak for 24 hours. Seeds that fail to swell the first time may again be subjected to this pregermination treatment, often with success (99). In seven samples, the number of clean seeds ranged from a low of 5.3OO/kg to a high of 16,3OO/kg (2,400 to 7,400/lb). Seedling Development-The mode of germination is epigeal (99). Light is not a requirement for germination (83). Under favorable conditions-bare mineral soil, adequate moisture, and exposure to sunlight-koa seedlings will grow readily. Soil aeration and soil temperature may influence germination (83). Until recent years, the standard nursery practice was to sow koa seeds in wooden flats, then transplant the seedlings to tin cans (35). Now, plastic bags or tubes are used. Tube-grown seedlings are easier to plant. Properly pretreated koa seeds should be covered with 6 to 12 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in) of soil; they begin to germinate within a week. Seedlings in bags or tubes can be grown to plantable size of 20 cm (8 in) high in 10 to 14 weeks. Direct seeding of koa on prepared seed spots has been moderately successful (9,13) In two trials comparing broadcast sowing with direct sowing into prepared spots, stocking was four times higher on the direct seeded spots on Maui, whereas no difference in the percentage of stocked spots or of height growth was evident on the island of Hawaii. Koa has been recommended for watershed planting on well drained areas (34,37,39) and is described as ""the one native tree which can be easily handled in nursery and planting operations... suitable for the larger portion of areas in need of reforestation and particularly for the drier ridges and slopes"" (35). Other investigators, less enthusiastic about planting koa, did not recommend it (13,17), commenting as follows: ""Results on older soil formations have been uniformly disappointing. Frequently, the trees die out after 15 to 20 years"" (17). Plantations established on Maui during the late 1930's developed scattered, large trees of exceptionally poor form. Relatively few koa seedlings were planted after World War II. However, in the past 10 years, private land owners on the island of Hawaii, influenced by the short supply, began planting koa (104). Seedlings usually appear soon after land is cleared for pasture or roads, or after fires. As many as 354,700 koa seedlings per hectare (143,537/acre) were counted in the vicinity of old koa trees in burned-over areas (41). Seeds escaping the flames may be induced to germinate by the heat. Koa seedlings grow rapidly. One month after a burn, koa seedlings were at least 2.5 cm (1 in) tall; after 3 months they ranged from 10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 in) tall, averaging about 13 cm (5 in) (41). On a cleared area at 500 m (1,700 ft) elevation, 1-year-old seedlings ranged from 0.6 to 4 m (2 to 13 ft) tall and averaged 2 m (6 ft). On favorable sites, seedlings attain 9 m (30 ft) in 5 years (37). Eight months after a fire on Kauai, koa regeneration was most common near fire-killed parent trees, and maximum height growth was 4.6 m (15 ft) (103). The abundance, distribution, growth, and mortality of koa on burned-over areas on Oahu were monitored over a 2.5-year period (73). During this time, seedling density declined dramatically. The root-crown fungus Calonectria crotalariae caused more than half of this mortality. On these sites the seedlings grew about 2.3 cm (1 in) per month. Koa did poorly when planted on abandoned sugarcane land on the windward coast of the island of Hawaii. Survival at age 6 years was 78 percent, but trees averaged only 3 m (10 ft) tall, and only 62 percent were judged vigorous. Tree form varied from good to poor, with 77 percent cull (101). The abundance and distribution of natural regeneration after logging were studied on a 200-ha (500-acre) tract heavily infested with pigs and vines on the island of Hawaii (70). Seedling density of koa was about three times as great in disturbed as in undisturbed areas. Most koa seedlings found on the ground disturbed by logging were well established, but none of those growing on undisturbed ground were large enough to have much chance of surviving the menacing pigs and cattle. Koa seedlings in disturbed areas tend to be clustered around seed trees (70). In 1922, Krabel stated: ""Where cattle have been excluded for a number of years, koa groves are developing with surprising speed on exposed and barren ridges"" (43). The stimulating effect of soil scarification on seedling emergence is helpful in regenerating koa on degraded forest land where seed reserves still exist in the soil. Disking in the sparsely wooded pastures of the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge resulted in koa reproduction. Even in open areas far removed from live or skeletal remains of koa, a few seedlings emerged (15). In the natural rain forest, koa seedlings can emerge from mineral soil and organic seedbeds, such as decaying logs and treefern trunks. Seedling growth is generally slower on old logs than on mineral soil, possibly due to low nutrient availability. However, seedlings tend to survive better on organic seedbeds because these sites are elevated and out of reach of feral pigs. In the Kilauea Forest, more than 60 percent of the mature koa initially emerged from logs or other large organic seedbeds (16). Nevertheless, rarely do koa seedlings survive in the dense rain forest unless openings have been created, as by windthrow. Gap-phase replacement seems to be the primary mechanism by which koa is maintained in natural rain forest communities (53). Serious disturbances, such as fire or hurricane-induced windthrow, typically stimulate large-scale koa reproduction. Vegetative Reproduction-An intensive study of koa reproduction was made in 1943 (5) in an area of the Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii, where annual rainfall is about 1000 mm (40 in). Koa stands appeared to regenerate almost entirely by means of root suckers on this once heavily grazed site. The researchers reported that ""many vigorous suckers arise from the buried and exposed roots of a single tree. In three cases, suckers were seen 15, 27, and 29 m (50, 90, and 95 ft) away from the base of isolated koa trees. Suckers developed into healthy trees 8 to 16 cm (3 to 6 in) in diameter breast height in 5 to 6 years and were estimated to be 4 m (12 ft) tall."" Koa colonies (root sprouts originating from the mother tree) in the park expanded at the rate of 0.5 to 2.5 m (1.5 to 8 ft) per year (51). In 1973, a study to determine the influence of feral goats on growth of these root suckers found that the suckers became more numerous and vigorous once the goats were excluded (84). Suckering, however, did not occur where the soil was covered with tall dense grass (83). Koa can be propagated by rooting of cuttings under mist and shade when the material is in the immature, true-leaf stage of growth. Air layers of root suckers gave 16 percent rooting success, but rooting of root sucker cuttings under mist was highly variable, generally with a 20 percent success rate (76). Koa can be also propagated by callus cultures derived from shoot tips, but the method is slow and labor-intensive and not presently adaptable to large scale propagation (79). However, one clone, comprised of hundreds of ramets, has been produced by tissue culture of seedling shoot-tip callus (81). These tissue-cultured trees have been successfully out-planted in progeny tests (82). Koa root sprouts are common in rain forests as well as in savanna stands. Efforts to induce suckering of roots of selected plus trees, in situ, on both wet and dry areas failed, however. Attempts to simulate the actions of pigs and cattle with treatments including knife wounding, ""chewing"" with pliers, pounding, and exposure had no effect. Koa root suckers in rain forests are much more common on roots in deep shade or hidden under dense grass than in roots exposed to direct sunlight (76). Stump sprouts have rarely been observed but do occur.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield-Age of koa trees cannot be determined. Growth rings were not correlated with ""annual rings"" (102). Old relic forests still in existence were probably present at the time Captain James Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. The largest koa tree on record had a d.b.h. of 363 cm (143 in), total height of 43 m (140 ft), and a crown spread of 45 m (148 ft) (56). Stocking and growth data for natural regeneration on heavily disturbed sites and one plantation on the island of Hawaii are available (table 2). Table 2-Characteristics of koa growing in three natural stands and a plantation in Hawaii¹ The form of koa varies greatly. Most mature trees have large, open, scraggly crowns with limby, fluted boles. In the rain forests, on deep, rich soil, an occasional koa tree may surpass 34 m (110 ft) in height, but few possess clean, straight boles. On drier sites, the form of koa is even poorer, and trees are often stunted and misshapen. Precise yield figures from koa stands are not available. Missing from the koa and ohia-koa forests in many areas are the koa-size classes that normally form the recently mature, vigorous stands. In 1913, the condition of large tracts of koa forest was graphically described by Rock (62): Forest survey data from 1959-61 (98) indicated the condition of much of the sawtimber-size koa (trees more than 27.7 cm [10.9 in] in d.b.h.). Of 103 trees classified according to merchantability on the basis of form and defect, 36 percent were merchantable, 15 percent sound cull (with such defects as crook, excessive limbs, or poor form), and 49 percent rotten cull (excessive rot). Of the 103 trees, the average d.b.h. was 89 cm (35 in); of 31 trees, the average height was 22 m (72 ft), and the average crown diameter was 18 m (58 ft). Log grades were determined for logs in 103 koa trees. Less than two-fifths of all butt logs (first 4.9 m [16 ft]) met the specifications for either factory lumber logs or tie and timber logs. More than three-fifths were cull. Only 35 percent of the 103 trees sampled had an upper log of 2.4 m (8 ft) or more, and more than half of these logs were graded cull (98). Remeasurements in 1969-70 of the plots inventoried 10 years earlier (54) permit estimates of annual growth and mortality of koa on the island of Hawaii. Net annual growth was found to be a negative 4.52 million board feet of sawtimber and a negative 15 660 m³ (553,000 ft³) of growing stock (50). One study offers guidelines for estimating the volume of unsound wood associated with log surface defects common in koa (12) Rooting Habit-Little is known of the root development of koa. The tree grows on the deep Hawaiian soils, but also reaches impressive size on the shallow ""an"" lava flows. ""The root system of the mature koa is shallow and extensive, spreading out radially from the base for distances as great as 30 m (100 ft) or more"" (5). ""The tree has a shallow rooted system, a flat plane of roots spreading out in all directions just beneath the surface of the ground. For this reason the larger top-heavy trees are easily overturned by severe windstorms...."" (37). Large koa trees were toppled during a severe earthquake on the island of Hawaii in 1973. In describing the root systems of lava-flow plants, a researcher classified koa as one of the comparatively deep-rooted woody species (48). Reaction to Competition-Koa is classed as intolerant of shade both in the dry forest (28) and in the rain forest, and at all ages (26). Under favorable light, moisture, and soil conditions, koa competes aggressively with other vegetation. Koa has been classified in various ways by different investigators. One referred to koa as a pioneer species on the grassy slopes of dry forest sites (28), but another considered it a climax species (21). Koa has been considered the ultimate forest type, following the ohm forest on the ancient ""an"" lava flows (37). ""At maturity a grove (of koa) casts a shade in which its own seedlings have difficulty in growing, and unless they fill a vacancy in the parental ranks, they must seek the outer limits of the stand"" (64). Another investigator believed that koa ""reproduction need not be especially frequent to maintain the forest (type)"" Koa failed when underplanted in a dense native ohia rain forest at 870 m (2,850 ft), showing poor survival (44 percent), vigor, and form (70 percent cull), but three introduced nonleguminous species from Australia performed well (100). The effect of thinning and/or fertilizing a 12-year-old, stagnated kon stand were studied on the island of Maui. In this precommercial thinning, the number of stems was reduced 50 percent. Basal area growth rates for a 3-year period indicated that thinning increased growth significantly. Fertilizer yielded limited response; and the investigator thought that the fertilizer should be applied before crown closure (72). Damaging Agents-Hawaiian forestry literature is full of references to the disastrous effects of cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats on koa and other native species (1,4,5,1 7,26,35,38,40,77). Records of the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife show that more than 250,000 pigs, goats, and sheep were destroyed from 1921-46 in the forests of the island of Hawaii (10) during an eradication program. Such efforts did much to reduce the amount of browsing by these animals on koa forests. Feral cattle are particularly fond of koa root sprouts, seedlings, pods, and leaves. They straddle and trample large saplings to devour the foliage and bark. Feral goats have nearly disrupted the replacement cycle of koa on the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (84). In recent years, park rangers have taken steps to radically reduce the size of the g oat herds within the park. A study was conducted on the recovery of vegetation on koa parklands on Maui following the exclusion of goats. After 7 years, young koa regeneration was present both within and outside the enclosure, but the koa got large only if the goats were excluded (69). Koa will recover on these parklands if goats are eliminated. A large number of feral pigs inhabit the kon rain forests, and their rooting destroys many koa seedlings. It is thought that if the pig population is permitted to increase, the koa rain forest ecosystem will deteriorate (16). Koa attracts other kinds of animals. Black-tailed deer, introduced from Oregon to the island of Kauai in 1961, eat koa seedlings, but have little impact on the native vegetation. Less than 10 percent of the koa was browsed (94). The tree rat and the Hawaiian rat damage koa saplings by stripping off bark. One thousand koa saplings (2 to 5 years old) along an elevation transect from 770 to 1330 m (2,520 to 4,370 ft) in the Laupahoehoe area of the Hilo Forest Reserve were examined (71). Thirty percent of the trees had been wounded by rats, with wounds occurring as high as 10 m (33 ft). Bark along the main trunk and on lateral branches was subject to stripping. Terminal and lateral shoot dieback were observed where complete girdling occurred. In a study of mortality of koa saplings severely wounded by rats, damage was reported most severe in the vicinity of brush piles where nests were likely to be located. In 1925, more than 40 species of native insects were considered enemies of koa (92), and by 1983 the number of phytophagous insects associated with koa reached 101 (87). Insect damage to koa is well documented (18,22,58,59,91). One authority believes ""there are more endemic insect species attached to this koa complex (Acacia koa and related koa members) than to any other genus in the Hawaiian islands"" (93) One of the most destructive insects of koa is the koa moth (Scotorythra paludicola), a lepidopterus defoliator found on the islands of Hawaii, Maui (105), Oahu, and Kauai ( 87). Severe outbreaks occur periodically. When these insects appear in large numbers, they may completely defoliate koa stands. Following an outbreak on Maui in which 1841 ha (4,550 acres) were completely defoliated, growth was reduced 71 percent, and about one-third of the trees died within 20 months (88). The introduced koa haole seed weevil (Araecerus levipennis) is the most prevalent insect that infests koa seeds, the next most common being Stator limbatus (85). The koa seedworm (Cryptophlebia illepida) destroys seeds and is a problem to control when seeds are collected for reforestation purposes. Eighty percent of the damage from this Tortricid occurs above 1037 m (3,400 ft) (85). Three other Tortricid species destroy koa pods or seeds (85,91). These seed moths may destroy 90 percent or more of any given seed crop in the pods (93). Stein (86) reviewed the biology and host range of koa seed insects, their parasites, and hyperparasites. At high elevations, koa terminals are sometimes heavily attacked by the Fuller rose beetle (Pantomorus cervinus), but the attacks appear to be highly seasonal and of no serious consequence. The acacia psyllid (Psylla uncatoides), first found in Hawaii in 1966, feeds and breeds in the new growth of koa. This psyllid also has become a serious pest of the closely related koaia (Acacia koaia) (47). The black twig borer (Xylosandrus compactus) is associated with injury and mortality. Information on diseases of koa has increased in recent years. Seedlings may be attacked by Calonectria theae, which causes a shoot blight (55) and C. crotalariae, which causes a crown rot (57). This pathogen also caused a collar rot that severely affected koa seedlings regenerating a burned-over area (2). A wilt disease, Fusarium oxysporum, was observed among koa seedlings (24). This fungus may contribute to the premature decline or death of old koa trees growing within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Indications are that this fungus is seed-borne, but seed disinfection did not reduce disease incidence (24). Koa was moderately tolerant to Phytophihora cinnamomi in greenhouse tests (42). Dieback is common in the crowns of old trees, and it was observed in more than half the sawtimber-size koa measured during the 1959-61 forest survey The root-rot fungus Armillaria mellea is associated with this dieback (44,61). Stands possibly weakened by old age, extended droughts, and grazing have succumbed to attacks by this fungus. Other diseases of koa are those caused by the sooty molds, such as Meliola koae, that cover the leaves and restrict growth. Four rust fungi, Uromyces koae, U. digitatus, Endoracejum acaciac, and E. hawaiiense, occur on koa (25,32). Both species in the genus Uromyces, obligate parasites, cause witches' brooms and leaf blisters that deform branches and phyllodes. When infections are heavy, they can deform and debilitate both young and old trees (23,30,31). The Hawaiian mistletoe (Korthalsella complanata) has been observed in many koa stands, and it can deform young koa. Heart rot, caused principally by Laetiporus sulphureus and Pleurotus ostreatus, is common in most mature and overmature koa (6). More than half the large koa measured in the 1959-61 forest survey were unmerchantable because of excessive rot (98). Pole-size and small, sawtimber-size koa have thin bark and are easily damaged by fires. Weeds are serious problems in certain areas. The banana poka (Passiflora mollissima) smothers both koa reproduction and mature trees by laying a curtain of vines over them. The German-ivy (Senecio mikanioides) is also difficult to control.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,14,0
"Koa is found on volcanic soils of all geologic ages and degrees of development, from the young ash and ""aa"" lava rock soils on the island of Hawaii to the oldest soils on Oahu and Kauai. The tree grows best on moderately well drained and well drained, medium to very strongly acid soils. These recent soils are higher in plant nutrients, having been subjected to less leaching and erosion than have the soils on the older islands. Most koa forests grow on two of the great groups in the soil order Inceptisol: Hydrandepts and Dystrandepts. Hydrandepts are found in areas of high rainfall. They are high in amorphous materials and have high cation exchange capacities, but extremely low base saturations due to the high rainfall. Although deficient in available phosphorus, sodium, potassium, calcium, and silica, they have a high content of organic matter and hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum, manganese, and titanium. Infiltration rates are rapid and erosion is slight to moderate, depending upon the degree of slope. Dystrandepts are formed under lower rainfall than the Hydrandepts. They have slightly greater base saturations than the Hydrandepts. The next most abundant soil great group on which koa grows is the well drained Tropofolists (organic soils of the order Histosols). Other minor soils include Haplohumults and Kandihumults of the order Ultisols and Hapludox and Acrudox of the order Oxisols. Koa grows at elevations ranging from 90 m (300 ft) on Oahu (45) to 2100 m (7,000 ft) on Hawaii (37), on flatlands and slopes. Koa has been listed as a component of the forests occupying gulch and ravine walls sloping 40 to 800 (49). The flora of Hawaii have been divided into groups occupying different zones of elevation (29): The lowland zone, at or near sea level; open country, with isolated trees or clumps of trees. Koa rarely grows here. The lower forest zone, upper limit 300 to 600 m (1,000 to 2,000 ft); tropical in character, woods rather open. Koa grows in scattered stands, in admixture with ohia. The middle forest zone, upper limit 1500 to 1800 m (5,000 to 6,000 ft); within the region of clouds, where vegetation develops the greatest luxuriance. Here koa reaches its greatest development in size and number. The upper forest zone, upper limit as high as 2400 to 2700 m (8,000 to 9,000 ft). Koa reaches into this zone, but seldom above 2100 m (7,000 ft).",Soils and Topography,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,15,0
"The most important use of koa timber by the Hawaiians was to build canoes. The largest of the giant war canoes extended 21 m (70 ft). Canoe hulls were made of single, giant koa logs. Koa was also used for sursurfboardsiboards, some 5.5 m (18 ft) or longer, for paddles, and for framing grasshouses. The bark provided dye to tapa, a light cloth made from the bark of wauke (Broussonetia papyrifera) (11,19). Koa wood is now used primarily for furniture, cabinet work, and face veneers. It is widely used in woodcraft. Cabinet makers recognize a dozen or more types of koa wood, including curly or ""fiddle back"" koa, red koa, and yellow koa (11). One local use is for making ukuleles. At one time koa was sold on the world market as Hawaiian mahogany (62). Large logs have a narrow, creamy-white band of sapwood. The heartwood may vary through many rich shades of red, golden brown, or brown. The heartwood seasons well without serious degrade from warping, checking, or splitting (74). Although it has been stated that foresters in Hawaii have paid little attention to koa (83), more than 1.3 million koa seedlings were planted by the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife between 1915 and 1946 (78) for watershed protection. Koa, however, did not perform as well as many introduced species on these deteriorated sites.",Special Uses,Koa,acacia,koa,hardwood,16,0
"Laurel oak is a major species in the forest cover type Willow Oak-Water Oak-Diamond-leaf (Laurel) Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 88) (5). Diamond-leaf oak makes up most of the stand in this type where drainage is poor, sometimes forming almost pure stands, while laurel oak grows on the better drained sites such as sandy banks of streams. Laurel oak is also an associated species in the following forest cover types: Cabbage Palmetto (Type 74), Loblolly Pine (Type 81), Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Type 83), Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Type 92), and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102). Associated tree species may include Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii), red maple (Acer rubrum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), swamp hickory (Carya glabra), honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos); and on wetter sites water hickory (Carya aquatica), waterlocust (Gleditsia aquatica), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata). On better drained sites laurel oak may be associated with spruce pine (Pinus glabra), loblolly pine (P. taeda), swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii), and cherrybark oak (Q. falcata var. pagodifolia) (5). In Florida, southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), pignut hickory (C. glabra var. glabra), Carolina basswood (Tilia caroliniana), and scrub hickory (C. floridana) are associates. Around Charleston, SC, laurel oak's tree associates include redbud (Cercis canadensis), American beech, yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), southern magnolia, spruce pine, white oak (Q. alba), and Carolina basswood. Associated shrubs and vines include crossvine (Bignonia capreolata), sweet rhododendron (Rhododendron canescens), sweetleaf (Symplocos tinctoria), and muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia).

"Rainfall averages between 1250 and 1500 mm (49 to 59 in) a year over the natural range of laurel oak. From 500 to 1000 mm (20 to 39 in) of this is received during the growing season from April to September, except during occasional years when there is a summer or fall drought lasting 1 to 3 months. Average annual temperatures across the range of laurel oak vary from 16° to 21° C (61° to 70° F). Extreme lows range from -1° to -18° C (30° to 0° F). Extreme highs range from 38° to 43° C (100° to 109° F). Relative humidities seldom fall below 60 percent.

"In the past, laurel oak and diamond-leaf oak have been considered by some to be two varieties or even separate species (11). Trees first recognized as laurel oak were on well-drained sandy banks of streams whereas diamond-leaf oak was found on poorly drained flat sites (5). Burke concluded that laurel oak itself is of hybrid origin, intermediate between and derived from willow oak and water oak (2,3). His work is based on a leaf-shape index applied to seedlings grown from acorns collected on the North Carolina Outer Banks and at Chapel Hill, NC. He states that laurel oak is not found outside the ranges of the two supposed parental species. This would appear true based on most published maps showing the range of willow oak available in 1961 and 1963, when Burke's publications appeared. However, the range map for willow oak published in 1965 (14) shows willow oak to be absent in the southeastern half of Georgia and peninsular Florida where laurel oak grows in abundance, leaving some doubt that laurel oak is the hybrid between willow and water oak (14). The following hybrids with Quercus laurifolia as one parent have been recognized (11): Quercus falcata Q x beaumontiana Sarg.), Q. incana Q. x atlantica Ashe), Q. laevis Q. x mellichampii Trel.), and Q. marilandica Q. x diversiloba Tharp ex A.

Laurel oak is native to the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from southeastern Virginia to southern Florida and westward to southeastern Texas with some island populations found north of its contiguous natural range. The best formed and largest number of laurel oaks are found in north Florida and in Georgia. -The native range of laurel oak.,Native Range,Laurel Oak,quercus,laurifolia,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Laurel oak is monoecious; stamens and pistils are in separate flowers on the same tree. Staminate flowers are home in naked catkins developing from leaf axils of the previous year. Pistillate flowers are usually solitary, on short, stout, glabrous stalks developing from axils of leaves of the current year. Flowering occurs in February and March, about the time the last of the previous year's leaves are shed (15). Pollen is wind disseminated. Flower crops are abundant almost every year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Laurel oak acorns are brown to almost black, 13 mm (0.5 in) in both diameter and length, with one-quarter or less enclosed in a thin saucerlike cup (7). Acorn production begins when the trees are 15 to 20 years old; they soon become prolific bearers. Acorns require 2 years to mature and fall to the ground during late September and October. Some of the acorn caps remain attached to the tree. There are about 1,235 sound, uncapped laurel oak acorns per kilogram (560/lb). Acorn dissemination is mainly by squirrels but is aided by gravity and runoff during rains. Most sound acorns sink but some float and are carried a long distance (14,15). Seedling Development- Acorns of trees in the black oak group, to which laurel oak belongs, show embryo dormancy and germinate the following spring after fall ripening. Germination is hypogeal (15). Laurel oak acorns exhibit only mild dormancy. Without any cold stratification, germinative capacity in two samples of laurel oak acorns was 50 percent (15). In another test, germination of laurel oak acorns, with one exception, was unaffected or only slightly increased by 30 days' soaking in distilled water (10). There are few or no published descriptions of laurel oak seedling development after acorn germination. Vegetative Reproduction- When cut or burned, a young laurel oak produces many sprouts from the base of its stump. Older trees do not sprout vigorously, and their sprouts are more susceptible to decay than those of young trees (14).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Laurel Oak,quercus,laurifolia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Laurel oak grows rapidly and usually matures in about 50 years which has led to its wide use as an ornamental (14). Southeastern Forest Survey data show the largest volume of laurel oak in the 25- to 36-cm (10- to 14-in) d.b.h. classes with average total heights from 18 to 21 in (59 to 69 ft). It has the poorest timber quality of the red and black oaks, producing sawtimber only on the best sites. It is marketed mainly as pulpwood. Considering live volume of trees 13 cm (5 in) in d.b.h. and up from a stump height of 30 cm (12 in) and a top diameter of 10 cm (4 in), laurel oak has an average annual mortality of 1.1 percent, an average annual growth of 4.1 percent, and an average annual removal of 2.0 percent. It shares a high mortality rate with water oak because of their relatively thin bark among oaks and susceptibility to fire. Only about half of laurel oak's growth is harvested each year. In an assessment of aboveground biomass of trees 2.5 cm (1 in) in d.b.h. and larger, laurel oak constituted 3.4 percent of associated hardwood biomass and 8.4 percent of the oak biomass. A conservative estimate of growth is 6.4 em (2.5 in) in d.b.h. every 10 years (9). Rooting Habit-Laurel oak develops a large well-defined taproot on upland sands as observed on trees uprooted for road construction (12). No published information on the rooting habits of laurel oak was found. Reaction to Competition- Laurel oak is classed as shade tolerant from seedling to mature tree and often becomes established and grows up through the dense canopy of a swamp border. Natural pruning is poor and large limbs persist on the bole many years, even under a dense canopy (14). Damaging Agents- Fire is especially hazardous to laurel oaks. They are frequently killed by even light ground fires and heartrots are common in trees subject to occasional burns (14). Laurel oak is host to the general oak-feeding insects but no serious insect problem is mentioned in the literature. Several species of Curculio weevils infest acorns, including those of laurel oak (1). Although not seriously harmed themselves, laurel oak, water oak, and willow oak are the three most susceptible hosts for the alternate stage of fusiform rust (Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme) of southern pines. Laurel oak is also susceptible to oak leaf blister (Taphrina caerulescens), actinopelte spot (Actinopelte dryina), and canker rots by various fungi (8).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Laurel Oak,quercus,laurifolia,hardwood,14,0
Laurel oak is most common on alluvial flood plains. It tolerates the wetter sites in association with other oak species but does not withstand continuous or prolonged flooding. It is most often found growing in sandy soil near rivers and along the edges of swamps if not too frequently flooded. Laurel oak grows in the hammocks of central Florida and on sand hills adjacent to swamps in west Florida. It is also planted as an ornamental with little regard to soil type (14). Laurel oak grows best on Ultisols and Inceptisols.,Soils and Topography,Laurel Oak,quercus,laurifolia,hardwood,15,0
"Laurel oak has been widely planted in the South as an ornamental, perhaps because of the attractive leaves from which it takes its common name. Large crops of laurel oak acorns are produced regularly and are an important food for white-tailed deer, raccoons, squirrels, wild turkeys, ducks, quail, and smaller birds and rodents (4). Comparing volumes of the 10 most heavily used fall and winter food items found in 423 rumen samples of deer from Florida, laurel oak acorns rated fifth, sixth, or seventh highest in quantity consumed in a 6-year period (6). Acorns were most frequently consumed and in the largest quantity by 32 wild turkeys whose crops were examined in Florida; of the identified acorns, laurel oak was second only to live oak in quantity and frequency (13).",Special Uses,Laurel Oak,quercus,laurifolia,hardwood,16,0
"Laurel is associated with other pioneer species common to roadsides or gaps in mature forests, gallery forests, or savannas that are subject to natural or human disturbances. Some of these, yagrumo hembra or trumpet-tree (Cecropia peltata) and yagrumo macho or matchwood (Didymopanax morototoni), have extensive ranges that overlap that of laurel throughout the West Indies and the tropical Americas. In the Subtropical Dry Forest of Puerto Rico, laurel grows with almacigo or turpentine-tree (Bursera simaruba), guayacan or common lignumvitae (Guaiacum officinale), and the common naturalized exotics, bayahonda or mesquite (Prosopis pallida) and tamarindo (Tamarindus indica). In Subtropical Moist Forest it is associated with roble blanco or white-cedar (Tabebuia heterophylla), cedro hembra or Spanish-cedar (Cedrela odorata), algar-robo or West-Indian-locust (Hymenaea courbaril), jaguey blanco or shortleaf fig (Ficus laevigata), and the common naturalized exotics, flamboyan or flamboyant-tree (Delonix regia) and caoba dominicana or small-leaf mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni). It also grows on disturbed tabonuco forest type (Dacryodes excelsa), along with yagrumo macho and guano or balsa (Ochroma pyramidale). Tabonuco is the mature natural forest remnant of Subtropical Wet Forest (17).",Associated Forest Cover,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,1,0
"Laurel reportedly grows best in Tropical Moist to Tropical Wet Forest life zones (11,12) where mean annual rainfall ranges from 2000 to 5000 mm (80 to 200 in) and mean annual temperature is 24° C (75° F). But in Trinidad (21) best growth of laurel was observed outside rain forests where annual rainfall was between 1270 and 1900 mm (50 to 75 in). The natural distribution of laurel in Puerto Rico seemed to follow this trend (19). In Central America and the West Indies, laurel grows in Tropical or Subtropical Dry Forest life zones; mean annual rainfall is about 750 to 2000 mm (about 30 to 80 in) and mean annual temperature is from 25° to 27° 0 (77° to 81° F). Growth is much slower and form is less impressive in the drier areas. In Puerto Rico laurel grows mainly in coastal Subtropical Moist Forest or in the Subtropical Wet Forest uplands (17) where mean annual rainfall ranges from about 1000 mm (40 in) to 3500 mm (138 in) or more. Less frequently in Puerto Rico it occurs in Subtropical Dry Forest where mean annual precipitation is between 600 and 1000 mm (24 and 40 in).",Climate,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,2,0
"Considerable confusion still exists as to the taxonomy of laurel. Great variation in climate, soils, and elevation within its extensive natural range contribute to large differences in flowering and fruiting phenology and morphological features such as flower and leaf size (30). Thus Cordia alliodora has several botanical synonyms. The most common are Cerdana alliodora and Cordia gerascanthus. There is some doubt whether Cordia trichotoma, growing in Brazil and Argentina, is really a separate species or merely a variety of C. alliodora (30). Two distinct races are recognized in Costa Rica and probably exist throughout the extensive native range which includes wet and dry habitats (12). Laurel was included in the 1977 FAO Panel of Experts Report on Forest Genetic Resources Priorities for Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America (8). The species is not in danger of disappearing because of its large range, but there are areas, such as in Colombia, where overcutting may destroy local populations. For this reason and the fact that the species exhibits fast growth in plantations and has utility for various wood products, there is an urgent need for botanical, genecological, and collecting work. The most vigorous collection program for provenance testing now underway is that coordinated by the OFI. Since 1977, 19 native and 2 exotic collections have been made, within altitudinal ranges of 50 to 2000 m (160 to 6,600 ft) and precipitation ranges of 1040 to 4700 mm (41 to 185 in). Most results have been analyzed for trials only 1 year old. Definite trends are not yet possible to interpret but the Finca la Pineda, Nicaragua, seed source has consistently performed well, as have the Finca la Fortuna and San Francisco sources from the north coast of Honduras. Sources from Costa Rica have usually given rather poor nursery results but surviving trees have performed well in the field (30). A separate collection of 24 Costa Rican plus-trees did poorly in Puerto Rico from 1976 to 1978 and the test was closed after 2 years (42). Tree improvement work is also underway with laurel in Colombia; 31 superior trees were selected in 1978 (35). Seed collection areas have also been designated in Costa Rica and Colombia (29). As the OFI-coordinated trials develop and more data are analyzed, interesting trends should become discernible as to adaptation of laurel provenances to particular soil, climate, and altitudinal regions.",Genetics,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,7,0
"Laurel is the most widely distributed species of Cordia, a genus including some 200 species ranging from shrubs to large trees. The geographic range is quite extensive, from latitude 25° N. to 25° S., or roughly from the State of Sinaloa in Mexico to Misiones in Argentina (30). The range also includes most of the West Indies (16). Laurel is thought to have been introduced to Jamaica (13) and was first planted in Surinam as an exotic plantation species in 1967 (36). It has also been planted as an ornamental in Florida (16). Local distribution maps are not generally available, except for Mexico (7), Colombia (37), and Puerto Rico (16) where ranges are given for both geographical and political regions. In Puerto Rico laurel grows in more than half of the municipalities, in 8 of 13 State Forests, and in the Luquillo Experimental Forest Biosphere Reserve.",Native Range,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- In Costa Rica, laurel reaches sexual maturity within 5 to 10 years (12). Some Costa Rican provenances have flowered at 4 years and produced viable seed at 5 years when planted in Surinam (36). Flowers are perfect and crowded on a widely branched terminal panicle 10 to 30 cm (3.9 to 11.8 in) across. The calyx is cylindrical with 11 prominent ribs. The corolla is white with persistent oblong lobes, 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long and 1.5 to 3.5 mm (0.06 to 0.14 in) wide. There are five white stamens that are erect and protrude well beyond the exserted style, which is two-forked, each fork having two broad stigmas (16,30). Flowers are perfect and crowded on a widely branched terminal panicle 10 to 30 cm (3.9 to 11.8 in) across. The calyx is cylindrical with 11 prominent ribs. The corolla is white with persistent oblong lobes, 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long and 1.5 to 3.5 mm (0.06 to 0.14 in) wide. There are five white stamens that are erect and protrude well beyond the exserted style, which is two-forked, each fork having two broad stigmas (16,30). Overall phenology is quite variable across the range, a common phenomenon for tree species having such extended ranges. Major flowering in Central America occurs from February through March (30) and extends through May at least in Costa Rica (24). In the southern part of the range, as in Surinam, flowering occurs earlier, from December through January (36). In Puerto Rico there are no marked wet or dry seasons, and flowering takes place in almost any season (16). Laurel flowers throughout the year in Colombia and Ecuador too, but there is altitudinal variation; the high wet areas flower early in the year, and low dry areas flower later on, into July and August (23). Pollination is by wind or Lepidoptera, and perhaps by bees (12). Trees bear masses of flowers that are quite conspicuous from great distances. If surveys are synchronized with anticipated flowering times, regional or local distributions can be determined easily and with reasonable accuracy (30). Fruits are cylindrical and ripen within 1 to 2 months after flowering commences. Nutlets are oblong, one-seeded, about 6 mm (0.25 in) long. Seeds are wind dispersed, yet they can persist on the trees a few weeks after ripening. Seedfall is usually quite variable since laurel flowers throughout the year. In Central America maximum seedfall is usually in April and May (33). Seed Production and Dissemination- A persistent corolla acts as a parachute for seed. Individual trees produce 2 to 8 kg (4.4 to 17.6 lb) of seeds at 42,000 to 100,000 seeds per kg (19,100 to 45,400 seeds/lb) (30,33,36). Based on provenance collection work by the Oxford Forestry Institute (OFI) at Oxford University in the United Kingdom (30), the optimum procedure is threefold: Seedling Development- Germination is epigeous. Seeds of laurel (fig. 1) germinate within 5 to 20 days after seedfall if there is sufficient soil moisture and a good mineral seedbed. Germination and nursery practices vary among countries currently planting laurel for research or commercial purposes. Wildling stock was successful in Puerto Rico in the late 1940's (20). Planting on mounds and plowing or burning with subsequent protection of sown seeds has been successful in Costa Rica (31). In Surinam, seeds are sown directly into plastic bags or young seedlings are dug up from specially prepared seedbeds located directly beneath designated seed trees (36). In Colombia, seeds are directly seeded onto nursery beds. The yield is about 20,000 seedlings per kilogram (9,100/lb) of seed, but only the most vigorous seedlings are transplanted into plastic bags from germination trays (29). Several kinds of soil mixtures have been used for nursery beds or bagged seedlings. These include clay in Belize; sterilized, washed riversand in Nepal; well-tilled, fertile subsoil in Colombia; and a mixture of equal parts of clay, sand, and black earth in Brazil (30). In Colombia, germination has been poor using sand/soil mixtures (2). Small-grained vermiculite has been more successful in Costa Rica than conventional sand or loam soils (12). There seem to be no particular requirements for sterilization of soils. Little consistency appears yet in determining optimum seedling size for transplanting or outplanting (30). Reported transplanting criteria for seedlings are 3 cm (1.2 in) tall in Brazil, 14 days old in Nigeria, 2 months old in Belize, the four-leaf stage in Ecuador, and the two-full-leaf stage in Fiji. Outplanting has been done after seedlings spent 10 months in the nursery in Belize, 5 months in Liberia, 5 to 8 months in Surinam, and 2 to 6 months in Costa Rica (30). Outplanted seedlings in Colombia are at least 15 cm (5.9 in) tall, and the recommended minimum lower stem diameter is 20 mm (0.8 in) (30). Stump planting, using a lifted seedling trimmed to 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) of roots and 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in) of stem, is now probably the most preferred outplanting technique. Initial seedling growth after outplanting is usually rapid. Plants have grown about 2 to 3 m (7 to 10 ft) per year after 3 years in Surinam (36). Single individuals from Trinidad and Costa Rica were 7 m (23 ft) and 11 and 17 em (4 and 7 in) in d.b.h. after 3 years (12). A 2-year-old planting in Colombia averaged 1.9 m (6.2 ft) in height and had 86 percent survival (3). After 7 years mean annual height growth was 2.6 to 2.9 m (8.5 to 9.5 ft) on sands and 2.0 to 2.2 m (6.6 to 7.2 ft) on heavier textured soils in Surinam (36). Fertilizers have been unsuccessful in improving juvenile height or diameter growth (12). In one trial, several combinations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium did not affect either height or diameter growth of laurel in Costa Rica. In another trial, growth of laurel seedlings 1 year after outplanting was not significantly different between unfertilized and fertilized plots of laurel alone or between fertilized and unfertilized plots with laurel planted with maize (5). At least two laboratory observations have shown that light and temperature affect seedling growth (12), the best regime being a long (14.5 hr) day and high constant temperature, 30° C (86° F). Height growth occurs in periodic flushes during the growing season; when branches are elongating, terminal growth is slow. Cambial activity begins as the terminal initiates flushing. In Costa Rica, growth rings are almost always annual (32). However, boundaries between summer and early wood are not always distinct or abrupt so that several disks from different bole levels are usually needed to detect all growth rings. Vegetative Reproduction- Coppicing and epicormic branching on injured young trees have been reported in Costa Rica (12). Sprouting was seer from lateral roots in Trinidad (21). But research in this particular area seems nonexistent except for us of stem and branch sets in laurel tree improvement work in Colombia (14,35).",Reproduction and Early Growth,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Mature laurel is a medium to large tree. Under optimum growing conditions it may reach 30.5 in (100 ft) and about 100 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. (12). More commonly, it is 20 in (66 ft) high and 46 cm (18 in) in d.b.h. The bole is cylindrical and erect, with whorled branches appearing in horizontal layers. There is good natural pruning for 50 to 60 percent of the bole, even in open-grown trees. Buttresses are small, extending from 0.9 to 3.0 in (3 to 10 ft) upwards from the ground. The outer bark is greenish brown on young trees, becoming light gray or brown and slightly fissured at maturity. Inner bark is light brown, fibrous, and tasteless. It gives off a slight odor of garlic, a fact that promoted its scientific name (16). Although laurel is native to most of tropical America, it is not yet a major plantation species in the Western or Eastern Hemispheres. Thus, almost all growth records have been collected from trees growing in natural forests. In older, mature stands (more than 80 years), it is common to find only one individual per 2.0 hectares (4.9 acres). In younger stands (less than 30 years), where tolerant species have not yet had time to outgrow laurel, clumps of few to 30 or more individuals can be found over small distances. There are no reports on total longevity. According to OFI experience with field provenance collections, the best stands of laurel are located on the Caribbean coast of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The oldest natural stands of laurel for which growth data have been collected are found in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica (12); recorded d.b.h. was 79, 89, and 91 cm (31, 35, and 36 in) for 40-, 50-, and 60-year-old trees. Mean annual growth for an average tree at 40 years was 0.19 in' (34 fbm, International 0.25-in Log Scale). A volume table with upper height and d.b.h. limits of 24 m (79 ft) and 76 cm (30 in) exists for laurel found in second-growth forest in Alajuela and Heredia Provinces in northern Costa Rica (22). Laurel intercrops well with agricultural crops (40). In the coffee region of Chinchina, Colombia, at 1400 in (4,600 ft), in a planting with 100 to 200 laurel trees per hectare (40 to 80/acre), laurel could produce 49 to 74 m³/ha (700 to 1,057 ft³/acre) per year over a 20-year period (26). When intercropped with coffee in Costa Rica (41), laurel had a mean annual increment of 10.8 m³/ha (154 ft³/acre) in a 15-year-old planting. Pure plantations of laurel were established as early as 1922 in Nigeria (30). Quantitative growth data are available only from Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Surinam. Through age 20 in Costa Rica (table 1), mean annual height and d.b.h. increments were slightly better than 1.0 m (3.3 ft) and 15 mm (0.6 in). Afterwards, growth seemed to decline somewhat. Extrapolating from 7-year data in Surinam, laurel could obtain a minimum outside bark d.b.h. of about 40 cm. (16 in) in 25 years (36). Projected d.b.h. growth is 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 in) at 20 years for plantation sites in Colombia (29). In Puerto Rico's young plantations (table 2), height and d.b.h. were better in Subtropical Moist Forests and Subtropical Wet Forests than in Subtropical Dry Forests. But height growth on steep slopes was poorer than height growth on uniform or lower slopes in Subtropical Wet Forests. Site variation affects laurel growth. In Costa Rica growth was poor on shallow stony soils and on a steep slope having less profile development than an adjacent flat area (5). In Surinam, best diameter growth on sandy soils was on the lower slopes where lower horizons had accumulated sufficient alluvial clay to retain soil moisture during long dry periods (36). On heavier textured soils best growth was also on the lower slopes; texture of the A horizon was lighter (loamy sand) and internal drainage was better there than on the ridge tops where drainage was poor because of plinthite accumulations (36). Observations from Puerto Rico and elsewhere indicate that growth in plantations slows, perhaps considerably, before sawtimber size is reached. Rooting Habit- No active research on root development is known. Rooting has been reported as deep and extensive in Fiji (30) and large and spreading with surface laterals and sometimes a deep taproot in Puerto Rico (39). In both countries laurel has suffered little blowdown or stem breakage in the crowns during cyclonic storms. Reaction to Competition- Silvicultural research of laurel is still in its infancy. Advances are being made as more countries recognize the value of laurel wood products and the species' potential for fast growth. Any silvicultural technique must consider that laurel is classed as an intolerant pioneer species, demanding lots of light for best growth. Attempts have been made with limited success to encourage natural regeneration in Costa Rica by mechanically clearing or poisoning undesirable species on selected sites (5). Considerable time and money are needed, however, to keep down weeds or more tolerant shrubs and trees once natural seeding has been established. Other artificial regeneration systems are line and enrichment plantings (12). In line plantings, swaths are cleared through natural forest and laurel seedlings or stump plants are planted at specified spacing up and down the lines. Shade from adjacent forests doesn't seem to reduce growth of C. trichotoma in Argentina (6). In Surinam, enrichment plantings have been done in two ways (36). In the first, commercial natural forest species are removed and all undesirable plants are poisoned or cut 1 to 2 years before the anticipated planting date. Laurel seedlings are then planted in clumps of three, 1 m (3.3 ft) apart so that each seedling is the apex of an equilateral triangle. Spacing between clumps is 10 by 5 m (33 by 16 ft), or 200 groups per hectare (81/acre). At the final rotation some 130 to 150 trees per hectare (53 to 61/acre) remain. Any laurel natural regeneration is left at planting time. In the second method used in Surinam, all commercial species with diameters from 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) are left after initial logging of 12.5/ha (30.9/acre) blocks. Rows 250 m (820 ft) long spaced 1.5 m (5 ft) apart are then established in an east-west orientation; planting holes are dug for laurel seedlings at 10 m (33 ft) intervals along the lines. Weeding of seedlings is done by machetes or poisoning. The first thinning is done after 3 years, and the best tree in each group is left. As early as 1945 in Puerto Rico and 1963 in Costa Rica, laurel was successfully established through the Taungya Method in which tree seedlings are planted between rows of food crops; when crops are harvested the tree seedlings are left in place (1). There are several agroforestry systems under study in Costa Rica now to determine whether laurel can be grown successfully in associations with various cultivated crops (5). Some field observations show that laurel grows better when secondary forest brush is allowed to form the understory than when grass predominates, as occurs in repeatedly cleaned plots (12). The grass may offer greater root competition to laurel trees than the other secondary shrubs. Damaging Agents- Rodents and birds destroy much of the seed in forest clearings or on direct seeded areas where seeds are not protected or covered (31). Coleoptera of the genus Amblycerus also damage laurel seeds (12). In the nursery, seedlings have been infected by a leaf-spot disease in Puerto Rico and by root cutters (Phyllophaga spp.) in Venezuela (12). The terminal of outplanted seedlings is very susceptible to damage or malformation from competing weeds and vines (25). More than 212 different forms of insects were found on laurel in Panama. But none of the seedlings or trees affected showed any signs of serious injury (12). In Puerto Rico laurel foliage has been heavily attacked by the Spanish elm lacewing bug, Dictyla montropidia (20). A canker-causing rust, Puccinia cordiae, attacks laurel in the West Indies and has been reported in Guatemala (12). Cankers form at the base of young lateral branches and are sources for usually more serious secondary infections. Trees planted on wet sites are very susceptible. In the Solomon Islands, a black fungal or viral canker (unknown spp.) has caused severe damage to nodes on main stems (30). There may be some relationship between this disease and the fact that these island., are continually humid, with no distinct dry season Mistletoes (Loranthaceae) are also a problem in some areas (12). At least one grass, Melinis minutiflora, has had an adverse effect on laurel growth when extracts from the grass were applied on young seedlings (12). Ant domitia are common in the swollen nodes of laurel lateral branches. They are most prominent in Central America and northwestern South America being almost totally absent from the West Indies Ants usually cause no damage to laurel plantings.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,14,0
"The altitudinal range of laurel is broad, from almost sea level in several countries, including Puerto Rico, up to 2000 in (6,560 ft) in the Colombian highlands. More commonly, it grows below 500 m (1,640 ft). Laurel grows best on well-drained, medium-textured soils and does not tolerate either poor internal drainage or water-logging. But it is not exacting in nutrient requirements, adapting well to degraded and abandoned areas once used for row crops, pasture, or shifting cultivation. Topography suited to laurel ranges from flat coastal lowlands, having deep infertile sands and little organic matter (Entisols or Oxisols), as in Surinam (36), to very dissected mountainous uplands, with deep, fertile volcanic soils high in organic matter (Andepts-Inceptisols), as in Colombia and Costa Rica (29). In Puerto Rico, laurel grows on shallow soils of the moist volcanic uplands (Inceptisols), on deep-red clay soils of the moist to wet volcanic uplands (Ultisols), and on shallow soils over limestone (Alfisols).",Soils and Topography,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,15,0
"Throughout its range, laurel is also used as a shade tree in coffee and cacao plantations as well as in pastures. Humans eat fruits in some places and both seeds and leaves are used for home medicinal purposes (15). Laurel is suitable for ornamental use in urban residential areas and has been tried for use in honey production because of its copious flowering (16). In Brazil it Yielded 266 liters (70 gal) of ethanol per ton of dry material; this compares well with a yield of 325 liters (86 gal) per ton produced by Protium spp., the best of 25 species tested (28). Laurel is still to be evaluated fully for pulping; physical and mechanical properties of sawn and roundwood are quite good. General strength properties are good and similar to those of mahogany (4,9,34). Specific gravity ranges from 0.44 to 0.52 (10). Freshly felled material seasons rapidly with only slight warping and checking; volumetric shrinkage is around 9 percent. Wood is easy to work, finishes smoothly, and glues readily (18). Heartwood is not receptive to preservative treatments but has some resistance to fungi, termites, and marine borers (4). Degree of resistance appears to be related to coloring of the heartwood, darker colored wood being more resistant than lighter colored heartwood. Heartwood coloring is also used to distinguish between laurel blanco (light) and laurel negro (dark) wood in Central America (27). The former is associated with the soft-wooded Cordias, like C. alliodora; the latter is associated with the harder, heavier density (specific gravity 0.63 to 0.84) Cordias like C. gerascanthus (4). Variations in heartwood coloring within any of two major groups could be caused by local site properties as well as by age (27).",Special Uses,"Laurel, Cap&aacute; Prieto",cordia,alliodora,hardwood,16,0
"As well as being dominant in the forest cover type Limber Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 219), limber pine is a minor component of the following (32); Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206), Whitebark Pine (Type 208), Bristlecone Pine (Type 209), Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Aspen (Type 217), Lodgepole Pine (Type 218), and Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237). In Canada, Montana, and central Idaho, limber pine forms pure stands at lower tree line or mixes with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and to a lesser extent, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum). It also appears as a minor component in stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), and occasionally subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). On some sites in Idaho and Montana, it is associated with whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). In Canada, it is sometimes found with white spruce (Picea glauca). Southward into Wyoming, southern Idaho, and northern portions of Colorado, Utah, and Nevada, limber pine may dominate windswept slopes and ridges at upper or lower tree line or appear in stands of white fir (Abies concolor), lodgepole pine, and Douglas-fir. In this region, limber pine appears most often with Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), least often with ponderosa pine. In Wyoming, limber pine occasionally coexists with whitebark pine, particularly in the Wind River Range. The two species also coexist on a few sites in northeastern Nevada (5,25), but usually where their ranges overlap they occupy different soils. Farther south in the remainder of its range, limber pine forms open stands near upper tree line, both separately and with Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) (44) but less often with Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) (6,18). It is also associated with whitebark pine on the east side of the Sierra Nevada (4). Occasionally, it mixes as a minor seral species with subalpine fir and white fir (23). Where limber pine would normally mix as a seral species with other conifers, as it does farther north, the closely related southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) appears in these situations, but this species does not extend onto the dry windy sites where limber pine is climax (23).",Associated Forest Cover,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,1,1
"Climatic data for actual limber pine habitat are quite scarce, but the general distribution of limber pine in Alberta, Montana, central Idaho, and east of the Continental Divide in Wyoming and Colorado, is in forested areas having a continental climate (2,3). This climate is typified by a relatively small amount of precipitation, with the wettest months during the growing season, very low humidity, and wide annual and diurnal temperature ranges. Winter conditions may be very cold, but relatively dry, and often include rapid fluctuations in temperature associated with chinook winds. Notable exceptions to this distribution are the small populations in eastern Oregon and adjacent Idaho, which lie within the Pacific maritime influence (3). In the remainder of its distribution, limber pine grows in climates that tend to have either more evenly distributed yearly precipitation or a winter peak in precipitation along with summer convectional storms. Throughout its broad range, limber pine is mostly absent in areas strongly influenced by Pacific maritime weather patterns. Only at its southern limits in the mountains of eastern and southern California (10) does the pine encounter a strong pattern of proportionately high winter precipitation (3). The amount of precipitation, however, is relatively smaller than that of the Pacific Northwest.",Climate,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,2,1
"Although zones of intergradation between limber pine and southwestern white pine are found in north central Arizona and north central New Mexico (36), no true hybrid populations of limber pine have been recorded. Limber pine has been crossed artificially with western white pine (Pinus monticola), southwestern white pine (P. strobiformis), Mexican white pine (P. ayacahuite), Himalayan pine (P. griffithii), eastern white pine (P. strobus), and possibly whitebark pine (P. albicaulis) (35).",Hybrids,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,9,1
"Three possible races of limber pine have been suggested, distinguished by height growth of the seedlings: (1) a northern race ranging from Alberta to north central Colorado and northern Utah and including the only sample from California; (2) a southeastern race that includes populations from the Wyoming-Nebraska border, east central Colorado, and north central New Mexico; and (3) a southwestern race in southern Utah and western Colorado (Nevada populations were not sampled) (43). Further study, however, found no geographically associated patterns or trends when a much wider variety of characteristics was analyzed from the same seed sources (36).",Hybrids,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,9,1
"Limber pine grows from Alberta and southeastern British Columbia to New Mexico, Arizona, and eastern California. Notable outliers of this general distribution are found in the western portions of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska, and in eastern Oregon and southwestern California. In the northern half of its distribution, limber pine is generally found near lower tree line and on dry sites in the montane forests. Between the 45th and 40th parallels, it grows in both lower and upper elevation forests and anywhere in between on dry, windswept sites. Its position gradually shifts upward in more southerly latitudes, so that in southern portions of its distribution, limber pine is more common from upper montane to alpine tree line, with only minor occurrences in the lower forested zones. Because of this adaptability, limber pine ranges in elevation from about 870 m (2,850 ft) in North Dakota (29) to about 3810 m (12,500 ft) in Colorado (7). - The native range of limber pine.",Native Range,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,11,1
"Genetic variation exists within limber pine in a general north-south pattern, but the range of variability for any one trait is small. Some isolated populations in Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado appear to be more similar to those from more southern latitudes than to populations at the same latitude (36).",Population Differences,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Limber pine is monoecious-male and female strobili are borne separately on the same tree. As with most pines, male strobili predominate in the lower crown and female strobili most often develop at the apical end of main branches in the upper crown. Male strobili emerge from buds in the spring and are arranged in small clusters of indistinct spirals. They may be green or yellow to reddish purple but turn brown when mature and about to shed their pollen. Pollen is shed during June and July. Female strobili emerge from buds shortly after the male strobili and are green or red to purple. Cone scales flex and they remain receptive to pollen for only a relatively short time during June and July. After pollination, scales close and the strobili begin to develop slowly. Fertilization takes place in the spring or early summer, about 13 months after pollination. Cones and seeds mature rapidly following fertilization. As they mature, cones change color from green to lustrous yellow. They are light brown when mature in August and September. Seed dispersal takes place during September and October (41). Seed Production and Dissemination- Large seed crops are produced every 2 to 4 years and seed numbers generally range from 7,050 to 15,000/kg (3,200 to 6,800/lb) and average 10,800/kg (4,900/lb) (38). Seed size varies geographically, with a tendency for increasingly larger seeds in more southerly latitudes (14,36). Although some trees produce seed having an ineffective vestigial wing (21), most limber pine seeds are wingless. The seeds are disseminated largely by rodents and birds. Of the birds, Clark's nutcracker is most important; it can transport pine seed for at least 23 km (14 mi) from seed source to communal caching areas (42). It can carry up to 125 limber pine seeds per trip in a sublingual pouch and buries in the ground one to five seeds per cache at a depth of 2 to 3 cm (0.8 to 1.2 in). Estimates indicate that Clark's nutcrackers cached in 1 year about 30,000 seeds per hectare (12,140/acre), most of which were limber pine (22). The birds' preferred cache sites were windswept ridges and southerly aspects where snow does not accumulate and the ground is exposed early in the spring. The locations of most limber pine stands probably reflect the site preferences of dispersal agents rather than those of the pine, since its only other apparent means of dissemination is gravity. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (41). Like seed size, rate of seedling development depends on the geographic source. In one study (36), 2-year-old nursery grown seedlings from Alberta averaged 4.3 cm (1.7 in), while those from New Mexico had reached 7.4 cm (2.9 in). Fall-sown seed, properly fertilized, produced a pencil-sized 2-0 seedling suitable for field planting (14). In the wild, many seedlings develop in clusters from Clark's nutcracker seed caches (20). The seedlings withstand this competition well and often retain the clumped habit into maturity. Vegetative Reproduction- No information is currently available.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- The slow growth rate and poor form normally attributed to limber pine discourages commercial interest in its use for timber and there is little information regarding its growth and yield. There apparently has been no attempt, however, to plant this species on forest sites superior to those chosen by birds and rodents that cache the seed. Where occasional limber pines grow in more densely forested stands with other tree species, sapling and pole size trees are often straight and single stemmed. One study (29) suggests, however, that limber pine growth rates may be greater on exposed windy knolls than on warmer south slopes and more moist north slopes. Rooting Habit- Type of substrate undoubtedly influences the rooting habit of limber pine. On many of the very rocky sites where it grows, the root system must follow the pattern of rock fracturing. As a result, most limber pine are quite wind firm. In nurseries, where there are better soil conditions, it develops a more uniform root system and can be transplanted by the ball and burlap method if previously root pruned (7). Roots of limber pine are also known to associate with a mycorrhizal fungus (Gomphidius smithii) (40). Reaction to Competition- Limber pine is relatively intolerant of shade and therefore seral to most of its associated trees, the exceptions being quaking aspen, Rocky Mountain juniper, and possibly ponderosa pine. It is also considered seral to bristlecone pine and Douglas-fir but will codominate with these species on severe dry sites (23). As a result, on most forest sites, limber pine normally acts as a pioneer species following fire or tree removal. Except on the most severe sites, where trees remain widely spaced, limber pine shows little evidence of maintaining its population in the presence of other conifers. It is most accurately classed as a species intolerant of shade. Damaging Agents- Fire can easily kill young limber pines because of their thin bark. Fuel loads on most limber pine sites are too light, however, to generate severe fire damage, and most of the large trees normally survive. Porcupines feed on limber pine, especially in the winter months (11). Several insects attack the pine in various ways. In Montana, the budworm (Choristoneura lambertiana ponderosana) feeds on the new needles of limber pine (37). A cone moth (Dioryctria spp.) is presumed to have damaged limber pine seed in North Dakota (29). In northern Idaho, the woolly aphid (Pineus coloradensis) attacked limber pine seedlings growing in test plots, but the pine showed considerable resistance to this insect (16). Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) also occasionally attacks limber pine (1). Limber pine is susceptible to several major diseases. Spongy root and butt rot (Armillaria mellea) and the red-brown butt rot (Phaeolus schweinitzii) attack limber pine over much of its range. The crumbly brown cubical rot (Fomitopsis pinicola) and red ring rot (Phellinus pini) commonly cause heart rot in mature and damaged trees (15,27). Limber pine is susceptible to white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) and can suffer considerable mortality when susceptible species of the rust's alternate host (Ribes) are nearby. The limber pine dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium cyanocarpum) is a common parasite of this tree. Occasionally, lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe (A. americanum) attacks limber pine, and the Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe (A. douglasii) and southwestern dwarf mistletoe (A. vaginatum subsp. cryptopodium) occur as rare parasites (12). Several foliage diseases also attack this tree, the most damaging being brown-felt snow mold (Neopeckia coulteri) (15).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,14,1
"In some areas, limber pine grows in greater numbers on certain soils, but the relationships vary geographically. In general, the substrates are Entisols. In Montana, limber pine grows mainly on calcareous substrates (26). Similarly, in eastern Idaho and western Wyoming, it grows mainly on soils derived from limestone or sandstone and is notably absent on adjacent granitic substrates (34), yet the population in South Dakota grows on soils derived from granitic rock (38). In central Idaho, limber pine is found largely on soils derived from sedimentary rocks; it is notably absent on granitic substrates, but grows in cracks of recent lava at Craters of the Moon National Monument (33). In eastern Oregon, a recently discovered population is on soils derived from serpentine (17). In Utah, it grows on soils developed from limestone, as on the Wasatch Plateau (9), and on soils derived from quartzites, shales and limestones of the Uinta Range (26). In southern Utah, it is most common on soils derived from sandstone and limestone (44). In northeastern Nevada, it also grows on various calcareous substrates (25), but in California, on substrates derived from granitic, obsidian, and pumice materials (30). Limber pine grows on a variety of topographies, from gently rolling terrain to cliffs. It is most often found on rocky ridges and steep rocky slopes and can survive in extremely windswept areas at both lower and upper tree line.",Soils and Topography,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,15,1
"Limber pine is seldom sought for timber, but small quantities are occasionally harvested along with more desirable species. The wood has been used for rough construction, mine timbers, railroad ties, and poles (2). Although of marginal value for lumber, limber pine has other resource values. Its ability to grow on harsh sites often provides the only tree cover for wildlife. The large seeds are a nutritious food source for birds, rodents, and bears and were used as food by Native Americans and early pioneers (20,21,29). In areas where timber is scarce, limber pine may be an important source of fuelwood. Increasing demands for fuelwood could deplete the accessible dead trees and eventually conflict with wildlife needs for shelter and nesting cavities. Limber pine's abilities to withstand severe wind and dry site conditions are desirable shelterbelt traits, but its slow growth rate may discourage its selection for that purpose. Young trees, however, can withstand considerable bending, a necessary trait for reforestation of snow avalanche paths, and much of the pine's natural habitat lies within avalanche areas. Some limber pine habitats are also valuable watersheds, and as a pioneer species, the pine is a logical choice for initial site protection and for increasing snowpack (39). The pine's characteristic branching pattern also adds to the esthetic appeal of the landscape, especially along ridge lines. This tree's ability to endure very dry environments has allowed it to attain considerable age in some areas. One tree in southern California was found to be well over 1,000 years old (13); another in central Idaho was 1,650 years old (31). This feature makes limber pine a useful species in dendrochronologic studies. Limber pine has potential as a Christmas tree, but its qualities are surpassed by southwestern white pine (14,43). Seedlings from several seed sources have grown too slowly for economical Christmas tree operations but have ornamental value as dwarfed trees and even bonsai (14). Some bonsai nurserymen also collect dwarfed limber pine from severe windy sites. As an ornamental, this species deserves more attention than current use would indicate. The ornamental trade has selected at least seven cultivated varieties: 'Columnaris'- a fastigiate form; 'Glauca' and 'Firmament'- both with exceptionally bluish-green foliage; 'Glenmore'- with longer, more silvery foliage; 'Nana'- a dwarf bushy form; 'Pendula'- with pendulous branches; and 'Tiny Temple'- a low growing form (7,19).",Special Uses,Limber Pine,pinus,flexilis,conifer,16,1
"Live oak makes up the majority of the stocking of the forest cover type Live Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 89) (1). Common associates are water oak (Quercus nigra), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua). On less welldrained sites it is accompanied by sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and American elm (Ulmus americana). On the Atlantic Coast and Florida, common associates also include southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), tree sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), and saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens). American holly (Ilex opaca), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), southern crab apple (Malus angustifolia), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens), and Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) are also common associates.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Live oak is monoecious. Flowers are produced every spring, March through May. The acorns, long and tapered and dark brown to black, mature in September of the first year and fall before December. Seed Production and Dissemination- Acorn crops are produced annually, often in great abundance. There is no published information on minimum seed-bearing age or size of the acorn crop. Number of sound acorns averages 776/kg (352/lb). Dissemination is by gravity and animals. Seedling Development- The acorns germinate soon after falling to the ground if the site is moist and warm. Germination is hypogeal. Probably few acorns remain viable over winter because weevils invade them, and they are eaten by many animals and birds. There is no published information on seedling growth and development. Vegetative Reproduction- Live oak sprouts abundantly from the root collar and roots. When tops are killed or when the tree is girdled, roots near the ground surface send up numerous sprouts. The capacity to sprout makes live oak difficult to kill by mechanical or chemical means.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Live Oak,quercus,virginiana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Live oak never attains great height, but the crown may have a span of 46 in (150 ft) or more. Open-grown specimens may have trunks 200 cm (79 in) in d.b.h. and average 15 in (50 ft) in height. Since the species is of little commercial importance except as an ornamental, growth and yield information has never been developed. Rooting Habit- There is no published information on rooting habits, but the ability of live oak to grow and mature on sites subject to hurricane-force winds suggests that it is a deep-rooted species. Reaction to Competition- Live oak may be most accurately classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. In the northern part of its range, live oak assumes dominance only near the coast, where it is freed from competition by the greater sensitivity of all other broad-leaf trees to salt spray. The exclusion of fire has increased its presence in the Lower Coastal Plain. Once established in a favorable habitat, the tree is very tenacious and withstands all competition. Damaging Agents- Young live oak is highly susceptible to fire. Its thin bark is readily killed by even light ground fires, leaving the trunk open to insects and fungi. The species is also susceptible to damage by freezing temperatures. Live oak decline, a wilt disease attributed to Ceratocystis fagacearum, has been reported in Texas where it is killing thousands of trees annually. The disease is also suspected to occur in other Southern States as well and is considered a potentially serious problem (2,3). Leaf blister, caused by Taphrina caerulescens, periodically results in considerable defoliation. A borer, Archodontes melanopus, commonly attacks roots of young oaks on the Atlantic Coast and may prevent the trees from developing normal form. In some localities, mistletoe (Phoradendron spp.) grows on the branches. Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), though an epiphyte, may damage trees because it accumulates in great abundance and decreases light reaching the interior and lower parts of the crown (6).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Live Oak,quercus,virginiana,hardwood,14,0
"Live oak nearly always grows on sandy soils belonging to the Ultisols, Spodosols, Histosols, and Entosols (5). Its resistance to salt spray and high levels of soil salinity makes it a dominant species in the live oak woodland on the barrier islands of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. In South Carolina it is found in dry sandy woods, moist rich woods, and wet woods. It is present in nearly every habitat in Florida from sandhills to hammocks, where it is generally the dominant species. In Louisiana, live oak is the dominant species on well-drained ridges bordering coastal marshes (3).",Soils and Topography,Live Oak,quercus,virginiana,hardwood,15,0

"Loblolly pine is found in pure stands and in mixtures with other pines or hardwoods, and in association with a great variety of lesser vegetation. When loblolly pine predominates, it forms the forest cover type Loblolly Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 81) (31). Within their natural ranges, longleaf, shortleaf, and Virginia pine (Pinus palustris, P. echinata, and P. virginiana), southern red, white, post, and blackjack oak (Quercus falcata, Q. alba, Q. stellata, and Q. marilandica), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), and persimmon (Diospyros virginiana) are frequent associates on well-drained sites. Pond pine (Pinus serotina), spruce pine (P. glabra), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), red maple (Acer rubrum), and water oak (Quercus nigra), willow oak (Q. phellos), and cherrybark oak (Q. falcata var. pagodifolia) are common associates on moderately to poorly drained sites. In the southern part of its range, loblolly frequently is found with slash pine (Pinus elliottii) and laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia). In east Texas, southern Arkansas, Louisiana, and the lower Piedmont, loblolly and shortleaf pine are often found in mixed stands. In Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80), loblolly predominates except on drier sites and at higher elevations. When shortleaf pine predominates, the mixture forms Shortleaf Pine (Type 75). In fertile, well-drained coves and along stream bottoms, especially in the eastern part of the range, yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white and Carolina ash (Fraxinus americana and F. caroliniana) are often found in the Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine cover type. Loblolly pine also grows in mixture with hardwoods throughout its range in Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82). On moist to wet sites this type often contains such broadleaf evergreens as sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), southern magnolia (M. grandiflora), and redbay (Persea borbonia), along with swamp tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), red maple, sweetgum, water oak, cherrybark oak, swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), white ash, American elm (Ulmus americana), and water hickory (Carya aquatica). Occasionally, slash, pond, and spruce pine are present. In the Piedmont and in the Atlantic Plain of northern Virginia and Maryland, loblolly pine grows with Virginia Pine (Type 79). In northern Mississippi, Alabama, and in Tennessee it is a minor associate in the eastern redcedar-hardwood variant of Eastern Redcedar (Type 46). On moist lower Atlantic Plain sites loblolly pine is found in Longleaf Pine (Type 70), Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Type 83), and Slash Pine-Hardwood (Type 85). In the flood plains and on terraces of major rivers (except the Mississippi River) loblolly pine is a minor associate in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91). On moist, lower slopes in the Atlantic Plain it is an important component in the Sweetgum-Yellow Poplar (Type 87). In bays, ponds, swamps, and marshes of the Atlantic Plain it is a common associate in Pond Pine (Type 98), the cabbage palmetto-slash pine variant of Cabbage Palmetto (Type 74), and Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Red Bay (Type 104). There is a great variety of lesser vegetation found in association with loblolly pine. Some common understory trees and shrubs include flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), American holly (Ilex opaca), inkberry (I. glabra), yaupon (I. vomitoria), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), pepperbush (Clethra spp.), sumac (Rhus spp.), and a number of ericaceous shrubs.

"The climate over most of the loblolly pine range is humid, warm-temperate with long, hot summers and mild winters. Average annual rainfall varies from 1020 to 1520 mm (40 to 60 in). The frost-free period varies from 5 months in the northern part of the range to 10 months along the southern coastal States. Mean annual temperatures range from 13° to 24° C (55° to 75° F); average July temperature is 27° C (80° F) and frequently exceeds 38° C (100° F). January temperature averages 4° to 16° C (40° to 60° F) and occasionally drops to -23° C (-10° F) in the northern and western parts of the range (69). During both winter and summer, weather within the range of loblolly pine differs from that immediately outside the range. There are a greater number of days with rain, a greater frequency of effective amounts of rain, that is, more than 13 mm (0.5 in), and higher average winter temperatures. In spring and autumn, the weather within and outside the range is more nearly the same (37). The main factor limiting northern extension of the species is probably low winter temperature with associated damage from ice, snow, and sleet and cold damage during flowering. Lack of adequate growing-season precipitation probably limits western extension of loblolly pine in Oklahoma and Texas (37).",Climate,Loblolly Pine,pinus,taeda,conifer,2,1
"The best-known southern pine hybrid is Sonderegger pine (Pinus x sondereggeri H. H. Chapm.), a cross between longleaf and loblolly pine. This natural hybrid occurs quite frequently in Louisiana and east Texas. It is conspicuous in nursery beds and plantings of longleaf pine because the hybrid gains height growth in the first year in contrast to longleaf seedlings, which do not. Natural hybrids of pond and loblolly pine have been observed in North Carolina, and those of pond, loblolly, and pitch pine have been recognized and studied in New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland (37,87). Natural hybrids of loblolly and shortleaf are known to occur in Oklahoma and east Texas (29,37,49), and based on observations of tree characteristics intermediate between loblolly and shortleaf, they probably also occur in Louisiana and Arkansas in areas where the two species commonly occur together. Hybridization between these two species is thought to contribute to the fusiform-rust resistance of loblolly pine from those sources (29). Artificial hybrids of loblolly pine and the other southern yellow pines have been produced. Two crosses-loblolly x shortleaf pine and loblolly x pitch pine-show considerable promise for use on a commercial scale. The loblolly x shortleaf cross will be used in areas with high fusiform-rust incidence for breeding a strain of loblolly pine resistant to the disease (60). The loblolly x pitch cross has growth characteristics of loblolly pine and cold resistance of pitch pine, making the hybrid more suitable for plantings in the north (30).",Hybrids,Loblolly Pine,pinus,taeda,conifer,9,1

Loblolly pine does not grow naturally in the Mississippi River flood plain and is scarce in the deep, coarse sands of the lower Atlantic Plain and sandhills of North and South Carolina; it is important only in localized areas in southeastern Georgia and northern Florida (37,55,69).

"Many studies of racial and geographical variation in loblolly pine have been carried out since research with loblolly pine began in the early part of this century. Provenance studies have shown differences in survival, growth, disease resistance, drought hardiness, and cold hardiness attributable to source of the seed. The many findings of geographical differences (some of which show continuous, others discontinuous variation with geographic location) have led geneticists to consider some differences to be racial. Although distinct races of loblolly pine have not been named and described, recommended zones for collecting seed for planting of seedlings in a given geographic area have been established. Seed orchards for producing seed for specific areas have been established (29,30,111). Resistance of certain families of loblolly pine to fusiform rust and the geographic variation in susceptibility of loblolly pine to the rust are important research findings now in use. Special rust-resistant seed orchards have been established with the most rust-resistant clones producing seed for specific geographic areas. Rust resistance of seedlings is low from seed sources in some areas such as east Texas and high for those in other areas such as Georgia and South Carolina. Rust resistance seems to be clinal and is strongly related to longitude of the seed source-the westerly sources are more resistant than the easterly ones (30,109,117). Loblolly pine from the Lost Pines area of east Texas is more drought resistant than those with more easterly seed sources. The use of drought-hardy strains of loblolly pine for planting in drought-prone areas is most important. Cold hardiness is also an important characteristic to be considered, especially if loblolly is to be planted north or inland of its natural range. As expected, the more northerly sources of loblolly pine are more cold resistant (29,37). Seed source affects yields of loblolly pine. These yield differences are usually attributable to the combined effects of seed source on survival, height and diameter growth, and susceptibility to fusiform-rust infection. Clinal effects in growth also are evident in the data, with trees from coastal areas growing faster than those from inland sources, except in northerly plantings. Loblolly pine trees within a seed source also vary in growth. Progeny tests of half-sib families (most of which are less than 10 years old) have shown significant differences in height growth with differences between races and families being additive. Nursery-bed selections of plus-seedlings have been effective in producing height growth gains for loblolly pine of 45 percent at age 10, and volume of the average plus-tree was 3.4 times that of the control. Although gains in other traits are not consistent, nursery-bed selection appears to be an effective first step in choosing fast-growing seedlings (30,53,109,112). Wood characteristics of loblolly pine have been extensively investigated. Specific gravity generally decreases from southeast to northeast and from the coastal areas to the Piedmont. Wide tree-to-tree variation also has been found for specific gravity, tracheid length, fiber angle, and cellulose type. A most important research result for geneticists has been that wood quality characteristics and growth rate at older ages are not highly correlated and, more important, not negatively correlated, which allows breeding for several traits (30).",Population Differences,Loblolly Pine,pinus,taeda,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Loblolly pine is monoecious; male flowers form in clusters at the tip of the preceding year's growth and female flowers form on the new year's growth. The pollen-bearing staminate flowers are catkin-like in appearance; they range from 2.5 to 3.8 cm (1.0 to 1.5 in) in length and vary from light green to red and yellow depending on stage of development. The pistillate flowers are generally ovoid and range from 1.0 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in length. They vary from light green through shades of pink to red depending on stage of development. Flowering of loblolly pine is initiated in July and August in a quiescent bud that is set from middle June to early July. The male strobili form in this bud in late July and the female in August, but they are not differentiated into recognizable structures until late September or October. In October the staminate buds develop at the base of a vegetative bud and the pistillate buds develop at the apex of a vegetative bud a few weeks later; both remain dormant until early February (37,41). The date of peak pollen shed depends on the accumulation of 353° C (636° F) day-heat units above 13° C (55° F) after February 1 (16). Flowering is also related to latitude, beginning earlier at lower latitudes than at higher ones, and it can occur between February 15 and April 10. Staminate flowers on a given tree tend to mature before the pistillate flowers, which helps to reduce self-pollination. Fertilization of the pistillate strobili takes place in the spring of the following year (37). Loblolly pine does not normally flower at an early age, although flowering has been induced on young grafts with scion age of only 3 years. The phenomenon of inducing such early flowering in seedlings is dependent on reducing vegetative shoot growth so that quiescent buds are formed in the latter part of the growing season to allow for the initiation and differentiation of reproductive structures. The formation of quiescent buds in seedlings and saplings does not usually occur during that period because four to five growth flushes are common for trees of this age. As a loblolly pine tree ages, the number of growth flushes decreases, which accounts in part for increased flowering of trees at older ages. Flowering is also genetically controlled and is influenced by moisture (May-July rainfall) and nutrient stresses. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production of loblolly pine varies according to physiographic region, climatic factors, and tree or stand condition. In the southern coastal portions of the Atlantic Plain, loblolly is generally a prolific and consistent seed producer, but in some of the inland portions of the Atlantic Plain, the Piedmont, and in the western extremities of its range, seed production is often lower and more erratic. Year-to-year variations in seed crops can range from failure to bumper crops. For example, in 27 years of seedfall records in the Atlantic Plain of South Carolina, there was one seed-crop failure but there were three seed crops of more than 2.5 million sound seeds per hectare (1 million/acre) with the other crops falling between these extremes. At most locations where seed-crop records have been kept, however, such wide annual variations have not been observed. Despite fluctuations in seed production, loblolly usually produces some seeds every year and good seed crops normally occur at intervals of 3 to 6 years. More than 198,000 sound seeds per hectare (80,000/acre) is considered a good seed crop; 74,000 to 198,000/ha (30,000 to 80,000/acre) is an average crop, and less than 74,000/ha (30,000/acre) is considered marginal, depending on seedbed characteristics and weather conditions. Throughout the range of loblolly pine, usually cones mature and seeds ripen by the second October after flowering or about 26 months after the strobili are initiated. The mature cones are light reddish brown and range from 7.5 to 15.0 cm (3 to 6 in) in length. They are narrowly conical to ovoid-cylindrical. Each cone scale is tipped with a stout triangular spine. Mature cones have a specific gravity of 0.89 or less (they float in SAE 20 oil). Individual cones may contain from less than 20 to more than 200 seeds, and the percentage of sound seeds may vary from about 15 percent to nearly 100 percent. Loblolly seeds vary in size from 27,100/kg (12,300/lb) to 58,200/kg (26,400/lb) and average 40,100/kg (18,200/lb) (37,88). Seed production of individual trees increases with tree age, size, and freedom from crown competition. By age 25, enough seeds may be produced in widely spaced trees to regenerate a stand; however, trees at 40 years generally produce three to five times more. Rotations shorter than 30 years usually do not lend themselves to natural regeneration. In well-stocked and overstocked stands, cone production of loblolly pine can be stimulated threefold to tenfold by releasing the seed trees from competitors at least three growing seasons before the seed is needed. If seed-tree release is delayed later than May 1, seed-crop stimulation will be delayed 1 year. In overstocked stands, if seed trees are not released before a harvest cutting, then seed-crop stimulation will be delayed 2 or 3 years, depending on the season of the harvest cut (37,61,95). Seedfall usually begins in October, and the bulk of the seeds are released in November and early December. Seedfall is hastened by dry, warm, windy weather and retarded by cool, wet weather. Seed dispersal in or adjacent to a stand varies with height and stocking level of the seed-source trees, magnitude of the seed crop, terrain, and weather conditions at the time of seedfall. The effective seeding distance ranges from 61 to 91 m (200 to 300 ft) in a downwind direction from the seed source and 23 to 30 m (75 to 100 ft) in other directions. Viability of seeds varies with seed-crop size and the month that the seed is dispersed. Seed viability is often lower in years of poor seed crops and in seeds dispersed late in the season (37). Loblolly pine seeds generally go through a stage of dormancy after seedfall, which lasts longer than that of any other southern pine. Seed dormancy is related to the impermeable properties of the seedcoat that constrain water imbibition and oxygen uptake; chemical germination inhibitors do not play a significant role (11,73). Dormancy is broken naturally as the seeds overwinter on the forest floor. Germination is epigeal (88). Natural seed germination usually begins in March when daytime temperatures range between 18° and 27° C (65° and 80° F). Few seeds remain viable (not more than 0.1 percent) on the forest floor for germination in the second year after seedfall (70). Secondary seed dormancy can be induced during seed handling procedures. Cold, moist stratification of the seed for 30 to 90 days at temperatures 3° to 5° C (37° to 41° F) are generally recommended to artificially break dormancy for direct seeding or for nursery sowing (74). Seedling Development- Moisture is a critical factor in seed germination and seedling establishment; the amount of rainfall in the spring is related directly to seedling catches. Scarifying the seedbed exposes mineral soil and increases contact of the seeds with moist soil surfaces. Failure of the root radicle to penetrate compacted or puddled soil surfaces reduces seedling establishment, especially on major skid trails and log decks. Soil compaction and puddling also reduce root growth, seedling survival, and shoot growth (36,37,40,61). Seedbed preparation by scarification or burning greatly increases seed germination and seedling survival, which reduces the number of seeds required to produce one seedling. For example, undisturbed seedbeds with a litter depth of 8 to 10 cm. (3 to 4 in) require 5 to 6 times more seeds to produce the number of seedlings produced in disturbed seedbeds. Seed germination decreases with age of seedbed and increases with clay content of the soil. Two-year-old seedbeds require 3 to 4 times more seed for successful establishment than do 1-year-old seedbeds, and 3-year-old seedbeds require 9 to 14 times more seed than is needed in the first year. Thus, favorable seedbeds usually exist for only 1 year after disturbance, after which they rapidly deteriorate. Heavier textured soils provide better seedbeds which results in higher seedling survival than do lighter textured soils (37,104). Drought is a major cause of mortality for planted loblolly pine seedlings, especially in areas with low rainfall during the growing season. Improper care, handling, and planting of nursery stock and inadequate site preparation for control of competing vegetation also contribute to poor survival by indirectly increasing moisture stress (34,57). Height growth of loblolly pine seedlings occurs annually in a series of two to five growth flushes and is dependent on variables such as temperature, day length, soil moisture, nutrients, competition, and genetics. Temperature has a dominant influence on the initiation of height growth in the spring. High day temperatures increase height growth, but high night temperatures decrease it. When day and night temperatures differ by 12° to 13° C (54° to 55° F), the best height growth occurs (15,43). Soil moisture influences growth of loblolly pine by its effect on internal water relations and vital physiological processes. Growth is reduced with increasing water deficits. For example, at a soil moisture tension of 1520 mm of mercury (2 atm), height growth of loblolly pine seedlings is greatly reduced and at 2660 mm of mercury (3.5 atm), height growth ceases. Height and diameter growth are significantly reduced by a late spring and summer drought, which also reduces early height growth the following year (37,98,116). Growth of loblolly pine seedlings in a natural stand is inversely related to overstory stocking of pine and hardwoods. As the proportion of hardwoods increases for a given pine stocking, loblolly pine seedling growth decreases. Size and shape of openings affect seedling growth up to 9 m (30 ft) from edges of openings. Seedlings growing beneath overstory hardwoods are not likely to survive more than a few years and if they do survive their growth will be slow. Growth and survival of loblolly pine seedlings during the first 7 years after a stand is regenerated may be reduced by 80 percent because of the faster growth of competing hardwood sprouts and shrubs. Pine seedlings not overtopped by hardwoods at age 3 or older have an excellent chance to outgrow the hardwood competition (37). Photosynthesis in loblolly pine seedlings is related to light and soil moisture conditions, which in turn are affected by competing hardwoods. Photosynthetic rates of many hardwoods are inherently higher than those of loblolly pine at relatively low light intensities and with low soil moisture (37). Fertilization often increases seedling growth in waterlogged soils. In some instances where specific nutrients are limiting growth, fertilization results in growth equal to or greater than that with drainage. Loblolly pine grows well on wet, fertile sites because of the effects of moisture on nutrient availability (63,101). Vegetative Reproduction- Young loblolly pine seedlings up to 3 years of age may sprout from buds in axils of primary needles if tops are clipped off, but older trees will not produce basal sprouts at root collars if stems are cut or top-killed by fire, nor do they produce root sprouts. Rooting is related to tree age and is more successful with cuttings from younger trees. Techniques and materials used to root cuttings are of critical importance. For example, a fine mist over the rooting bench is better than a heavy mist, and Hare's powder is a better compound to use than indolebutyric acid when rooting loblolly pine cuttings. Although needle bundles and buds of loblolly pine have been rooted, the success rate has been low. Air layering, a modification of rooting cuttings, has been the more successful method of the two. Success rates have been high for young trees but older trees are more difficult to air layer (29,42,48,110). Grafting is the most common method of vegetative propagation used to produce genetically uniform trees, especially in seed orchards. Grafting success is usually high but varies with scion material because problems may develop from incompatibility of scion and root stock (29,37,66). Producing genetically uniform plantlets from tissue cultures is a promising technique, and research is underway to develop procedures for the commercial production of loblolly pine clones (19,94).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Loblolly Pine,pinus,taeda,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Growth of loblolly pine stands is inherently good when compared to most hardwood competitors and on many sites doubles or triples the production of common associates (108). Growth is influenced by the physical and chemical properties of soils (texture, compaction, aeration, moisture, pH, nutrients), light, temperature, photoperiod, allelopathy, precipitation and its seasonal pattern, and intra- and inter-species competition for space and essential elements. Because many of these factors interact, it is difficult to specify the most limiting one. Consequently, these biotic and environmental effects are commonly expressed as the average height of dominant trees at age 50 years, that is, site index. Yield estimates for natural, even-aged loblolly pine in fully stocked stands were first made more than 50 years ago (3,106). Additional estimates have been made in more recent years for stands of various stocking levels (18,81,90,99). Normal yields of natural, even-aged loblolly pine stands on average sites, such as those with a site index of 27 m (90 ft), have ranged from 133.0 m³/ha (1,900 ft³/acre) in trees 9 cm (3.6 in) and larger in d.b.h. including 29.4 m³/ha (2,100 fbm/acre) in trees 24 cm (9.6 in) and larger d.b.h. at age 20 to 427.7 m³/ha (6,110 ft³ or 40,000 fbm/acre) at age 60 (all board-foot volumes reported in International quarter-inch rule). Mean annual cubic volume growth generally culminates at about age 40 on these sites with approximately 8.0 m³/ha (115 ft³/acre). As a result of larger sawtimber merchantability limits, mean annual board-foot growth culminates at about age 50 at a rate of 9.5 m³/ha (680 fbm/acre). Growth of loblolly pine may be affected adversely by drought, excess moisture (flooding), and nutrient deficiencies. Growth of this species is highly correlated with departure from the normal rainfall of April through October. Extreme negative and positive departures (-117 vs. 229 mm or -4.6 vs. 9.0 in) in seasonal rainfall over 21 years resulted in differences of nearly 2.1 m³ (74 ft³) of annual growth (12,39,65). Drainage (including bedding) and fertilization have been shown to increase dominant height and basal-area growth, resulting in dramatic increases in volume growth (45,63,76,101). Growth of planted loblolly pine is affected by the same factors affecting natural stands. Sites are usually prepared before planting on cutover lands, and some are fertilized to correct nutrient deficiencies. Such practices are applied to control competition and to supply nutrients at optimum levels to establish vigorous, uniform stands at spacings that will fully utilize site potentials. Yields of planted loblolly pine vary with plantation age, site quality, number of trees planted, and interactions of these variables. Yields generally increase with increasing age and site quality. Yields also increase with higher planting density or closer spacing; however, on some sites, moderately wide spacing of 2.4 by 2.4 m (8 by 8 ft) or 3.0 by 3.0 m (10 by 10 ft) outproduce both wider and closer spacing. Mean annual increment culminates at younger ages on better sites than on poorer ones. Better sites can carry more stocking than poor sites; consequently, initial spacing can be closer (9,77,93). Closer spacing tends to produce higher total cubic volumes at younger ages than does wider spacing; however, average tree sizes are larger on wider spacings than on closer ones. If sawtimber is a primary management objective, then wider spacing or lower density would be advantageous. Although thinning seldom increases cubic volume yield of loblolly pine, light thinnings that salvage suppressed and moribund trees have increased net yields by as much as 20 percent in 50 years. Thinnings usually result in increased diameter growth of residual trees and allow the growth to be put on the better trees in the stand. Another benefit is that thinnings provide intermediate returns on investment (2,17). Average total solid-wood yields of unthinned loblolly pine planted at 1,730 seedlings per hectare (700/acre) on non-old-field sites at various locations within its range were predicted to increase from approximately 155 m³/ha (2,200 ft³/acre) at age 15 to 300 m³/ha (4,200 ft³/acre) at age 30. Mean annual increment at age 30 was about 10 m³/ha (145 ft³/acre) (1,4,27,33,67). Estimates are also available for a variety of site and stand conditions and geographic areas (8,21,22,23,25,44,68,71). Growth and yield in natural uneven-aged loblolly pine stands is dependent on stand structure, stocking, and site quality. To optimize average annual growth on average sites with a site index of 27 m (90 ft), stand structure should be manipulated so that approximately 70 percent of the merchantable cubic volume is in the saw-log portion of the stand, that is, trees 25 cm (10 in) in d.b.h. and larger. On average sites, stands with approximately 17 m²/ha (75 ft²/acre) of basal area, or 140 m³/ha (2,000 ft³/acre) total merchantable volume, or 10,000 fbm saw-log volume at the end of the cutting cycle would be considered well stocked (5,84,86). On good sites in southern Arkansas, with a site index of 27 m (90 ft) managed uneven-aged loblolly pine stands that are well stocked have averaged 0.7 m²/ha (3 ft²/acre) of basal-area growth, 5.6 m³/ha (80 ft³/acre) of merchantable volume growth, or 432 fbm/acre of saw-log volume growth per year for a 29-year period. On somewhat poorer sites in the Georgia Piedmont with a site index of 23 m (75 ft), annual growth has averaged 5.3 m³/ha (76 ft³/acre) or 319 fbm/acre over a 21-year period (5,17,82,85,86). In sapling stands, differences in growth rate of individual loblolly pines are evident at early ages when competition between trees begins. The growth differentiation process begins at earlier ages on better sites or at higher levels of stocking; it begins later on poor sites or at low levels of stocking (51). The result is separation of trees into crown classes. Growth in height is a critical factor in the occupation of available space. Loblolly pine is a species in which individual trees tend to express dominance at an early age, and the most vigorous individuals that are best adapted to the microsite environment become dominants as the stand ages. Faster growing trees develop larger live-crown ratios than do slower growing trees. Diameter growth of individual trees generally increases as crown surface area and crown ratio increase, with optimal diameter growth occurring when trees have at least a 40 percent live-crown ratio. Diameter increment does not occur uniformly on portions of the bole. Annual diameter growth is greatest within the crown and decreases with increased distance below the crown. This phenomenon causes the bole of loblolly pine trees to become cylindrical with increasing age. Height growth is not as sensitive as diameter growth to differences in crown size. Height growth of codominants is significantly less, however, in dense stands of trees with small crowns than in low-density stands of trees with larger crowns (37,38,51). Loblolly pine is a medium-lived tree. Maximum recorded age of one tree in a small stand of 20 trees in North Carolina was 245 years, with the group averaging 240 years. The largest tree in this stand was 135 cm (53 in) in d.b.h. and 45.7 m (150 ft) tall. Currently, the champion for the species in the ""National Register of Big Trees"" is located near Urania, LA, and is 143 cm (56.3 in) in d.b.h. and 49.7 m (163 ft) tall (52). Rooting Habit- The rooting habit of loblolly pine is strongly influenced by tree age, soil, and the soil environment. A young tree develops a short taproot but in most cases it ceases growth in favor of an extensive lateral-root system. A taproot 1.5 to 2.0 m (5.0 to 6.5 ft) long is often produced on deep, sandy or loamy soils. On heavy clay soils, the taproot tends to be stout and short. Taproots of loblolly pines are much smaller and shorter than those of shortleaf and longleaf pines. On excessively wet sites or when a water table or an impenetrable hardpan confines the roots to surface layers of soil, lateral roots are prominent in a superficial system (3,50,108). In a 6-year-old loblolly pine plantation in southeast Louisiana, 83 percent of total root weight was in the upper 46 cm (18 in) of soil. In a 31-year-old natural stand in North Carolina, the majority of the feeder roots less than 2.5 mm (0.1 in) in diameter were concentrated in the 15-cm (6-in) deep A horizon; practically no lateral roots were found below the 15- to 53-cm (6- to 21-in) depth of the B horizon (14,59). Roots of loblolly generally spread laterally farther than their crowns. As a result, root grafting is a common occurrence both in natural stands and closely spaced plantations. Roots grow at all times of the year, but most root growth occurs in April and May, and in late summer and early fall (37,80,89,108). Reaction to Competition- Loblolly pine is moderately tolerant when young but becomes intolerant of shade with age. Its shade tolerance is similar to that of shortleaf and Virginia pines, less than that of most hardwoods, and more than that of slash and longleaf pines (31,37,108). Loblolly pine is most accurately classed as intolerant of shade. Succession in loblolly pine stands that originate in old fields and cutover lands exhibit a rather predictable pattern. The more tolerant hardwoods (including various species of oaks and hickories, sweetgum, blackgum, beech, magnolia, holly, and dogwood) invade the understory of loblolly pine stands and, with time, gradually increase in numbers and in basal area. The hardwoods finally share dominance with each other and with loblolly pine (37,83,100). The climax forest for the loblolly pine type has been described as oak-hickory, beech-maple, magnolia-beech, and oak-hickory-pine in various parts of its range (28,37). Others view the climax forest as several possible combinations of hardwood species and loblolly pine. There is evidence that within the range of loblolly pine several different tree species could potentially occupy a given area for an indefinite period of time and that disturbance is a naturally occurring phenomenon. If this is so, then the climax for this southern forest might best be termed the southern mixed hardwood-pine forest (83). Competition affects the growth of loblolly pine in varying degrees depending on the site, the amount and size of competing vegetation, and age of the loblolly pine stand. Across the southern region, average loss of volume production resulting from hardwood competition has been estimated at 25 percent in natural stands and 14 percent in plantations (35). In a North Carolina study, residual hardwoods after logging reduced cubic-volume growth of a new stand of loblolly pine by 50 percent at 20 years, and where additional small hardwoods of sprout and seedling origin were present, growth was reduced by another 20 percent by age 20 (10,64). Similar growth responses in young seedling and sapling stands have been observed in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas (24,26,39). Although several short-term studies (5 years or less) of the effects of understory hardwoods on growth of older loblolly pine did not show measurable effects (58), a long-term study (11 to 14 years) showed growth increases of 20 to 43 percent in cubic volume and 21 to 54 percent in board-foot volume after removal of understory vegetation (39). Control of both residual overstory and understory hardwoods is a financially attractive silvicultural treatment for loblolly pine management (10). Silvicultural practices such as prescribed burns, the use of herbicides, and mechanical treatments arrest natural succession in loblolly pine stands by retarding the growth and development of hardwood understories. Prescribed fire is effective for manipulating understory vegetation, reducing excessive fuel (hazard reduction), disposing of logging slash, preparing planting sites and seedbeds, and improving wildlife habitat. Responses of the understory to prescribed fire varies with frequency and season of burning. Periodic winter burns keep hardwood understories in check, while a series of annual summer burns usually reduces vigor and increases mortality of hardwood rootstocks (62). In the Atlantic Coastal Plain, a series of prescribed bums, such as a winter bum followed by three annual summer bums before a harvest cut, has been more effective than disking for control of competing hardwood vegetation and improvement of pine seedling growth after establishment of natural regeneration (103,104). Loblolly pine expresses dominance early, and various crown classes develop rapidly under competition on good sites; but in dense stands on poor sites, expression of dominance and crown differentiation are slower (37). Dense natural stands of loblolly pine usually respond well to precommercial thinning. To ensure, the best volume gains, stocking should be reduced to 1,235 to 1,730 stems per hectare (500 to 700/acre) by age 5. When managing for sawtimber, thinnings increase diameter growth of residual trees and allow growth to be put on the better trees in the stand, thus maximizing saw-log volume growth and profitability (56,78). Loblolly pines that have developed in a suppressed condition respond in varying degrees to release. Increases in diameter growth after release are related to live-crown ratio and crown growing space, but trees of large diameter generally respond less than trees of small diameter. Trees with well-developed crowns usually respond best to release. Trees long suppressed may also grow much faster in both height and diameter after release but may never attain the growth rate of trees that were never suppressed (37,75). Loblolly pine can be regenerated and managed with any of the four recognized reproduction cutting methods and silvicultural systems. Even-aged management is most commonly used on large acreages; however, uneven-aged management with selection cutting has proved to be a successful alternative. Damaging Agents- Agents that cause periodic damage to individual trees or stands of loblolly pine include wind, lightning, temperature extremes, ice, drought, flooding, insects, and diseases. Voluminous literature about the effects of these agents in loblolly pine stands on a range of sites, soils, and stand conditions is available; a brief summary follows. Large dominant trees usually are more vulnerable to high winds than smaller trees, and trees with large cankers caused by rust disease break more readily than sound trees. In general, damage resulting from severe winds associated with hurricanes or thunderstorms is caused primarily by windthrow or blowdown. Windthrow is most common on shallow soils with coarse-textured profiles. Wind damage is also more likely to occur in recently thinned stands (37,105). Direct losses to lightning are small, averaging only about 5 trees per 100 hectares (2/100 acres) per year. Large, dominant, open-grown trees are generally the most vulnerable to lightning strikes. Probably more important than the direct damage caused by lightning is the possibility that a lightning-struck tree will become a center for insect infestation (37). Damage or seedling mortality caused by low or freezing temperatures occurs primarily in the northern extremities of the loblolly pine range. Older, vigorous trees can usually withstand occasional low temperatures (37,79). Greater damage frequently occurs from ice or glaze storms. This damage is normally associated with branch and stem breakage, severe bending and, in some cases, uprooting. Ice damage is usually more severe in recently thinned (particularly row thinned) plantations and in heavily stocked stands made up of slender, small-crowned trees (37,91). Extremely high summer temperatures and drought often cause mortality of seedlings and, in some cases, of larger trees. Heat and drought more often cause stress and a resultant loss of vigor and growth in larger trees, which can lead to more serious problems with insect infestations. Loblolly pine seedlings or saplings cannot withstand prolonged flooding. Complete inundation for more than 2 weeks during the growing season often results in significant mortality. Larger trees are classed as moderately tolerant of flooding; typically they can survive one season but usually succumb during the second growing season if continuously in 0.3 m (1 ft) or more of water (37,113). A comprehensive review of insects associated with loblolly pine is provided by Baker (7). Loblolly pine serves as host to a multitude of insect pests; however, insect outbreaks vary greatly in frequency, area, and duration. The majority of outbreaks are small and short-lived and usually consist of only one or a few spots in a stand, but some may expand until they encompass hundreds of hectares and last for several years before subsiding. With only a few exceptions, the majority of the insects that attack loblolly pine are insignificant in terms of damage or mortality. The most serious insect pests to loblolly pine are bark beetles, particularly the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), whose attack may result in extensive mortality, and pine engraver beetles (Ips spp.), that can cause death of isolated or small groups of trees; pine tip moths (Rhyacionia spp.), that often infest young trees; seedling debarking weevils (Hylobius spp. and Pachylobius spp.), that sometimes result in girdling and death of young seedlings up to 13 mm (0.5 in) in d.b.h.; and cone and seed feeders (Dioryctria spp. and Leptoglossus spp.), that can seriously reduce seed crops. Loblolly pine is generally the preferred host of the southern pine beetle, which is the most destructive insect for this species (102). Most infestations originate in stands that are under stress because of poor site, adverse weather, overstocking, or overmaturity. Once a buildup of southern pine beetle occurs, adjacent well-managed stands may also be attacked. Preventive measures include avoidance of planting offsite and maintenance of vigorous stands through silvicultural practices such as controlling density through thinning and harvesting trees at or before maturity (6,102). A general account of diseases associated with loblolly pine is provided by Hepting (54). The most common disease problems in loblolly pine are related to seedling susceptibility to black root rot (Fusarium spp., Macrophomina spp., and possibly others) and fusiform rust (Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme); sapling susceptibility to fusiform rust; root rot by Heterobasidion annosum in thinned stands; and heart rot in old stands with Phellinus pini in the bole and Phaeolus schweinitzii primarily in the butt. Nursery seedlings are subject to root rot in soils with pH above 6.0 under moist conditions; however, root rot becomes severe only if soil temperatures remain above 32° C (90° F) for long periods. Fusiform rust is also a major nursery disease in many parts of the South, requiring rigid spray programs to keep infections low. The most serious stem disease is fusiform rust, which kills and disfigures young trees from Virginia to Texas. Saplings and older trees, especially if planted, are subject to attacks by Heterobasidion annosum in stands where some cutting has taken place. It is considered a disease problem in plantation management second only to fusiform rust. Losses in natural stands or in the absence of some cutting are generally negligible. Phaeolus schweinitzii causes a root and butt rot, usually after basal or root injuries, and in the Deep South it has caused more loss in some areas than Heterobasidion annosum. Red heart (Phellinus pini), entering almost entirely through dead branch stubs, is rarely a factor under the age of 60 years. However, when large branches that have heartwood begin to die, red heart can set in and destroy much of a tree.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Loblolly Pine,pinus,taeda,conifer,14,1
"Soils within the native range of loblolly pine are predominantly Ultisols. Small areas of Entisols and Spodosols are found in the Southeastern States and there are some Alfisols throughout the region. Loblolly pine grows on a wide variety of these soils, ranging from the flat, poorly drained Aquults and Aquods of the coastal portion of the Atlantic Plain to the relatively dry Psamments, Udults, and Udalfs of the inland portion of the Atlantic Plain, Piedmont, and upland Provinces (107). Best growth is on moderately acid soils with imperfect to poor surface drainage, a thick medium-textured surface layer, and a fine-textured subsoil. These soils are common in the uplands of the Atlantic Plain and on the flood plains and terraces of rivers and streams. Poorest performance is on shallow soils, eroded soils, and very wet or waterlogged sites (37). Some typical examples of Ultisols on which loblolly pine grows include the Coxville, Bladen, Beauregard, Wahee, Dunbar, Ruston, Norfolk, Orangeburg, and Smithdale series found in the Atlantic Plain; the Cecil, Davidson, and Appling series in the Piedmont; and the Hartsells and Linker series in the upland Provinces. Ultisols have a site index measured at base age 50 years for loblolly pine of 23 to 30 m (75 to 100 ft) in the Coastal Plain, 20 to 29 m (65 to 95 ft) in the Piedmont, and 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) in the upland Provinces. Typical Entisols on which loblolly pine is found include deep sands (Chipley, Eustis, and Lakeland series) and alluvial soils (Alpin and Osier series), with a site index ranging from 20 to 30 m (65 to 100 ft). Representative Spodosols include the Leon and Lynn Haven series, with a site index of 18 to 26 m (60 to 85 ft). Within the Atlantic Plain but confined to a strip on each side of the Mississippi River are loessial soils represented by the Memphis, Grenada, Providence, Calhoun, and Henry series. These loessial soils, as well as Caddo, Wrightsville, Meggett, and Bude series, all having a site index ranging from 23 to 34 m (75 to 110 ft), are some representative Alfisols on which loblolly pine grows. In the Atlantic Plain, the productivity of mineral soils generally decreases with improvement in surface drainage. Productivity is sensitive to soil fertility, however, and if fertility is low on poorly drained sites, productivity decreases (63). The presence of a spodic horizon within the rooting zone, as in the Leon series, frequently is associated with low productivity. Deep, excessively drained sands are also very low in site quality unless a water table or a clay lens which holds moisture lies within reach of the tree roots (37). In the Piedmont Plateau, where surface drainage is well developed, physical characteristics of the soil, rather than surface drainage, determine the availability of moisture, nutrients, and aeration. Here uneroded soils with a thick surface layer and a friable subsoil have a site index of 24 to 27 m (80 to 90 ft). Common series in this category are Appling, Durham, Davidson, Georgeville, and Cecil. The least productive sites are eroded soils with a very plastic subsoil such as the Orange and Iredell series. When the A horizon is gone, site index is less than 12 m (40 ft) (37). In the Ridge and Valley Provinces loblolly pine site index of 18 to 26 m (60 to 85 ft) generally increases from ridge tops to bottoms. This variation is related to landform, slope position and aspect, and geology. Soil features that determine site quality, such as soil temperatures, surface soil thickness, subsoil consistency, and soil moisture, are correlated with topography. However, past land use, differences in soil parent material, and other factors also affect soil profile development and cause variations in site quality independent of topography (92). Perhaps as significant as the soils on which loblolly pine grows are those soils in the region where loblolly pine does not grow. These are principally Mollisols of the Blackbelt, Entisols of calcareous river bottoms and terraces (that is, soils in the Louisa, Miller, and Precris series characterized by high base saturation and high pH) and Alfisols of the Coastal Prairie of Louisiana and Texas with moderately high base saturation. These soils may also have other unidentified properties which exclude pine (72). The topography throughout the loblolly pine range varies from flat near the coast to mountainous in the interior highlands. The topography can best be related to the physiographic regions within the loblolly pine range. The Atlantic Plain is generally flat near the coast but becomes rolling and hilly inland with elevations ranging up to 150 m (500 ft). The Piedmont Plateau is more rolling, with highly developed drainage patterns and generally finer textured soils. Elevations range up to 305 m (1,000 ft) in Georgia. The Ridge and Valley Province is about 64 km (40 mi) wide and extends into the loblolly pine range from southeastern Tennessee into northern Georgia and Alabama. The topography is characterized by a group of valley floors separated by long, narrow, zigzagging ridges; elevations range from about 185 m (600 ft) to about 365 m (1,200 ft). The Cumberland Plateau, which lies just west of the Ridge and Valley Province, is underlaid by massive sandstone and its topography is characterized by winding narrow-crested ridges and narrow valleys. In some places the sandstone has given rise to local upland flats and mesa-like forms or knobs. Elevations range from 150 m (500 ft) in the southern part of the region and in the valley floors to 305 m (1,000 ft) at the northern end of the region and on ridge tops.

"Natural loblolly pine stands as well as intensively managed plantations provide habitat for a variety of game and nongame wildlife species. The primary game species that inhabit pine and pine-hardwood forests include white-tailed deer, gray and fox squirrel, bobwhite quail, wild turkey, mourning doves, and rabbits (94). Some of these species utilize the habitat through all stages of stand development, while others are attracted for only a short time during a particular stage of development. For example, a loblolly pine plantation can provide forage for deer only from the time of planting to crown closure. Without modifying management practices, this usually occurs in 8 to 10 years (13). Bobwhite tend to use the plantation until a decline in favored food species occurs (20). As the habitat deteriorates, deer and quail usually move to mature pine or pine-hardwood forests (47) or to other newly established plantations. Management modifications such as wider planting spacing and early and frequent thinnings will delay crown closure, and periodic prescribed bums will stimulate wildlife food production. Wild turkeys inhabit upland pine and pine-hardwood forests and do particularly well on large tracts of mature timber with frequent openings and where prescribed burning is conducted (96,97). Pine lands are the chief habitat for some birds such as the pine warbler, brown-headed nuthatch, and Bachman's warbler. Old-growth stands are very important to the existence of the red-cockaded woodpecker. Large loblolly pine trees are favorite roosting places for many birds and provide an important nesting site for ospreys and the bald eagle (46). In urban forestry, loblolly pines often are used as shade trees and for wind and noise barriers throughout the South. They also have been used extensively for soil stabilization and control of areas subject to severe surface erosion and gullying. Loblolly pine provides rapid growth and site occupancy and good litter production for these purposes (114,115). Biomass for energy is currently being obtained from precommercial thinnings and from logging residue in loblolly pine stands. Utilization of these energy sources will undoubtedly increase, and loblolly pine energy plantations may become a reality.",Special Uses,Loblolly Pine,pinus,taeda,conifer,16,1
"Loblolly-bay is found in five forest cover types (2) within the Atlantic Coastal Plain (9,10,11). Pondcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 100) is found in certain Carolina Bays with ponded water. Loblolly-bay is not found in the bay interior with pondcypress (Taxodium distichum var. nutans), probably because of the high water table; rather it is found along better drained margins. Here it is growing with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and redbay (Persea borbonia var. borbonia) in the overstory and fetterbush (Lyonia lucida), inkberry (Rex glabra), and greenbrier (Smilax spp.) in the understory. Loblolly-bay is a minor component of Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82) but cannot be found consistently. In the middle Coastal Plain of South Carolina, loblolly-bay is found with loblolly pine, water oak (Quercus nigra), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), American holly (Ilex opaca), redbay, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). Loblolly-bay is found only in the wetter areas of this forest cover type. Loblolly-bay is a minor component of Atlantic White-Cedar (Type 97), along with pond pine (Pinus serotina), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), redbay, and sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana). Pond Pine (Type 98) is the typical vegetation of wet flats and some Carolina Bays in South Carolina. Loblolly-bay, pond pine, sweetbay, and redbay are the tree species present, and they rarely form a closed canopy. The thick, shrub layer is composed of fetterbush, greenbrier vines, inkberry, and loblolly-bay. Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Type 104) is the ""broadleaf evergreen forest"" of the lower Coastal Plain of North and South Carolina. Loblolly-bay is a minor component in the overstory along with red maple (Acer rubrum), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. sylvatica), sweetgum, and water oak.",Associated Forest Cover,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,1,0
"The climate over the range of loblolly-bay is characterized by mild winters and warm summers. Air temperature data, compiled from a weather atlas (8), are as follows: The average annual precipitation within the range of loblolly-bay is 1630 mm. (64 in) in Florida, declining to 1120 min (44 in) in North Carolina, and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. Approximately 53 percent of the annual precipitation occurs during the months of June, July, August, September, and October. Annually there are from 110 to 120 days with only a trace of rainfall.",Climate,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,2,0

"Loblolly-bay is continuously distributed along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from the Albermarle Sound of North Carolina to the Appalachicola River in the Florida Panhandle. Discontinuous populations exist in Florida, the coastal counties of Alabama, and southern Mississippi. In South Carolina it is commonly found in the lower Coastal Plain, but in the middle and upper Coastal Plain it is restricted to specific sites. -The native range of loblolly-bay.",Native Range,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowers are perfect. Flower bud formation is visible by the time new leaves fully expand. The peduncle expands rapidly and the young bud slowly enlarges until it opens. Flower buds at the top of the tree open first. Flowers are first seen from the last week in June to the first week of July and may be seen until mid-August. Flowers remain open for 1 or 2 days and are pollinated by humble bees, thrips, flies, and hummingbirds. After the second day the sepals and petals fall, leaving the ovary at the end of the peduncle. Seed Production and Dissemination- As the ovaries develop they gradually turn brown and five sutures develop. Mature, open capsules are first seen during September or October, and all of the capsules open by the middle of December. Seeds are shaken out of the capsules by the wind and empty capsules remain attached until peduncle and capsule abscission, which first occurs about the last of December and continues through the winter. Seedfall starts in October, peaks in December, and continues until the first of March. Loblolly-bay seeds are light (264,550 to 332,895/kg or 120,000 to 151,000/lb) and winged. Results from one study indicated that approximately 99 percent of the seeds produced fall within two tree heights of the source tree. This study also indicated that this distribution of seedfall is concentrated near the source tree, 60 percent of the seeds falling within a distance equal to one-half of the tree height, and 94 percent of the seeds falling within a distance equal to the tree height. Seedfall rates during a 2-year study varied from 2,645 to 272,920/ha (1,070 to 110,449/acre). Seedling Development- Seed germination in petri dishes in sunlight is high: 70 to 80 percent within 10 days. In a greenhouse heated at 13° to 16° C (55° to 60° F), similar germination percentages were obtained but up to 24 days were required. Germination is epigeal. Very few seedlings have been observed in the field and most of those seen apparently do not live past the first season. Loblolly-bay seedlings seem to require relatively open conditions and exposed soil for establishment. Older seedlings have only been observed where the mineral soil has been disturbed such as in recently plowed fire lines. Initial growth of the seedlings is slow. Field observations indicated that by the end of the third growing season the seedlings were about 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) tall and by the eighth growing season they were only 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) high. Vegetative Reproduction- Vegetative propagation of first-year shoots in a peat and sand medium under mist is commonly used by horticulturists (1). In the field, vegetative regeneration appears to be more common than regeneration from seed. Stump sprouts may grow as much as 1 in (3 ft) the first year after the tree is cut. These stump sprouts appear to be very attractive to deer and heavy browsing has been noticed. Numerous root-collar sprouts are produced when the trees are killed by fire (9) or if the root system is mechanically damaged by a logging or disking operation.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Early tree growth (ages 5 to 15 years) is relatively rapid. Height growth for the first 15 years averages 0.6 m/yr (2.0 ft/yr), with a 10-year-old tree averaging 6.5 in (21.3 ft) in height. These figures do not compare with the seedling's growth figures because growth and yield measurements were made on stems that were most probably sprouts. Early diameter growth at breast height is about 0.4 cm/yr (0.2 in/yr), a 10-year-old tree being about 5.1 to 6.1 cm (2.0 to 2.4 in) in d.b.h. Rooting Habit- The root system of loblolly-bay appears to reflect its strong tendency to reproduce by sprouting. A number of specimens examined had a large primary lateral root with secondary roots branching downward. Reaction to Competition- Loblolly-bay is classed as tolerant of shade. In bays and wet flats, where the tree cover is relatively light, loblolly-bay is a strong competitor. It generally increases in height faster than the pines on the adjacent upland. However, if loblolly-bay is overtopped, older trees will lose their characteristic conical shape and the crown will break up. Damaging Agents- Only two symptoms of insects or pathogens have been observed locally. Neither causal agent was identified. An ooze was noticed in a wound at the base of a mature tree, but otherwise the tree appeared healthy. An unknown grazing insect consumed all but the leaf veins of the late-season flush of leaves during August. Another noticeable sensitivity is to fire. The thin bark and shallow root system of loblolly-bay probably contribute to its low fire tolerance.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,14,0
"In North and South Carolina, loblolly-bay is apparently very soil-specific even though it is found on several soil series. It grows on certain Spodosols, Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Histosols and to a lesser degree on Entisols and Mollisols (7). Soil profiles of a loblolly-bay site in South Carolina have the following general characteristics: A1- O to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) black to dark gray, fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand, very strongly or extremely acid, A2- 25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 in ) black or gray, sand, loamy fine sand or sandy loam, very strongly or extremely acid (often there is no A2), B- 38 to 51 to 127 cm (15 to 20 to 50 in) gray or brown, sand to sandy loam, very strongly acid (often not present), C- 51 to 127 to 175 cm (20 to 50 to 69 in) gray or brown, sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand, strongly to very strongly acid. Loblolly-bay grows in flat woodlands or shallow depressions with little or no slope, slow runoff, rapid permeability, and poor to very poor drainage. In South Carolina the soils are usually of sandy coastal plain or marine origin, except for the organic soils. The water table is at or near the soil surface for 6 to 9 months of the year. In South Carolina's lower Coastal Plain, loblolly-bay is found in wet flats and in bays, typically the Carolina Bays (11). In the upper and middle Coastal Plain, it is found mainly along the edges of Carolina Bays and is widely dispersed in wet, flat woodlands on certain soil types.",Soils and Topography,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,15,0
"Loblolly-bay has long been used by horticulturists in landscaping (1). Most research on loblolly-bay has been done by horticulturists interested in propagating it. In the Southeast, loblolly-bay is considered a handsome and hardy tree valued for its glossy dark-green leaves and abundant white flowers. Its wood has been used in cabinetmaking and its bark as a tanning agent (5). Because of its ability to grow in wet bogs and flats where loblolly pine does poorly, loblolly-bay silviculture may offer a management alternative for such areas. Laboratory papermaking tests conducted recently and other results reported in the literature (3,4) indicate that the pulp yield from loblolly-bay was acceptable (52 percent), the bulk of the paper was low (1.46 cm/g or 2.53 in/oz), and the strength acceptable. One laboratory test indicated a breaking length of 11,525 m (37,812 ft), a tensile strength of 10.2 kg/15 mm (38.1 lb/in), and a count of 836 folds using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paper folding tester (1 kg or 2.2 lb). Although further testing needs to be done, these tests do not indicate any problems in making kraft paper from loblolly-bay pulp. Pulp mills in the lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina include loblolly-bay in their hardwood pulp.",Special Uses,Loblolly-Bay,gordonia,lasianthus,hardwood,16,0
"Lodgepole pine grows both in extensive, pure stands, and in association with many western conifers. The forest cover type Lodgepole Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 218) (26) exists as a pure (80 percent or more) component of basal area stocking, as a majority (50 percent or more), or as a plurality (20 percent or more). The cover type includes all recognized subspecies of Pinus contorta. Lodgepole pine is a component in 27 of the 55 SAF western forest cover types. In the Northern Interior (Boreal) group it is represented in White Spruce (Type 201), White Spruce-Aspen (Type 251), White Spruce-Paper Birch (Type 202), Paper Birch (Type 252), and Black Spruce (Type 204). It is a component in all six high elevation cover types: Mountain Hemlock (Type 205), Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206), Red Fir (Type 207), Whitebark Pine (Type 208), Bristlecone Pine (Type 209), and California Mixed Subalpine (Type 256). At middle elevations in the interior it is a minor component of seven other types: Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Western Larch (Type 212), Grand Fir (Type 213), Western White Pine (Type 215), Blue Spruce (Type 216), Aspen (Type 217), and Limber Pine (Type 219). In the North Pacific forests, it is a component in Coastal True Fir (Type 226), Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock (Type 227), Western Redcedar (Type 228), Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock (Type 230), Port-Orford-Cedar (Type 231), and Redwood (Type 232). At low elevations in the interior it is associated with Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237) and in the South Pacific forests it is a component of Jeffrey Pine (Type 247). Lodgepole pine, with probably the widest range of environmental tolerance of any conifer in North America, grows in association with many plant species (30,50,59,60). The lodgepole pine forest type is the third most extensive commercial forest type in the Rocky Mountains. Lodgepole pine's successional role depends upon environmental conditions and extent of competition from associated species. Lodgepole pine is a minor seral species in warm, moist habitats and a dominant seral species in cool dry habitats. It is often persistent even on cool and dry sites and can attain edaphic climax at relatively high elevations on poor sites. Fire regimes have played a role in this successional continuum, especially where repeated fires have eliminated a seed source for other species (27). Lodgepole pine may even overwhelm a site with seed stored in serotinous cones. It has four basic successional roles (50): Minor Seral- A component of even-aged stands rapidly being replaced by shade-tolerant associates in 50 to 200 years. Dominant Seral- The dominant cover type of even-aged stands with a vigorous understory of shade-tolerant species that will replace lodgepole pine in 100 to 200 years. Persistent- The dominant cover type of even-aged stands with little evidence of replacement by shade-tolerant species. Climax- The only tree species capable of growing in a particular environment; lodgepole pine is self-perpetuating.",Associated Forest Cover,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,1,1
"Lodgepole pine grows under a wide variety of climatic conditions (52). Temperature regimes vary greatly. Minimum temperatures range from 7° C (45° F) on the coast to -57° C (-70° F) in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Maximum temperatures range from 27° C (80° F) along the coast and at high elevations to well over 38° C (100° F) at low elevations in the interior. Average July minimums frequently are below freezing at high elevations. Lodgepole seedlings are relatively resistant to frost injury in some locations (16,42) and often survive in ""frost-pockets"" where other species do not. At low elevations in the interior, lodgepole pine grows in areas receiving only 250 mm (10 in) of mean annual precipitation, whereas it receives more than 500 mm (200 in) along the northern coast. Many interior sites often are low in summer rainfall. Seasonal distribution of precipitation is significant; snowfall supplies most of the soil water used for rapid growth in early summer. Temperatures are frequently favorable for germination after snowmelt, and germination occurs rapidly. Lodgepole is very intolerant of shade and generally grows best in full sunlight.",Climate,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,2,1
"This summary is based on a recent review of the literature on the genetics of lodgepole pine (20). The ability of some strains of lodgepole pine to grow well on poor sites and in cold climates has interested European foresters for many years. Much of what is known about the genetic diversity of the species has been learned from provenance tests, mostly in northwestern Europe. These tests have established that much of the variation observed in natural stands of lodgepole pine has a genetic basis.",Genetics,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,7,1
"No significant genetic barriers have been encountered in artificial crosses between geographical races of lodgepole pine. The species has been successfully crossed with jack pine and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). Crossability with jack pine is moderately high, and natural hybrids are common where their ranges overlap. Lodgepole x jack pine hybrids are fertile, but pollen abortion sometimes is high. Sierra Nevada lodgepole x jack pine hybrids are poorly adapted to jack pine's range. Artificial lodgepole x Virginia pine hybrids are difficult to produce, and most are chlorotic and dwarfed.",Hybrids,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,9,1

"Lodgepole pine is an ubiquitous species with a wide ecological amplitude. It grows throughout the Rocky Mountain and Pacific coast regions, extending north to about latitude 64° N. in the Yukon Territory and south to about latitude 31° N. in Baja California, and west to east from the Pacific Ocean to the Black Hills of South Dakota. Forests dominated by lodgepole pine cover some 6 million ha (15 million acres) in the Western United States and some 20 million ha (50 million acres) in Canada. - The native range of lodgepole pine.",Native Range,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,11,1
"Lodgepole pine has evolved several highly differentiated but inter-fertile geographic races that differ morphologically and ecologically: Rocky Mountain-Intermountain Race (var. latifolia)-Within the extensive range of this race, the trees are relatively tall, the bark is usually thin, and the needles are long and moderately wide. Cones are produced regularly from an early age and often are serotinous. The trees are intolerant and stands are considered seral in most forest communities. The persistent cones are hard and heavy, with protuberant scales. The cones may be reflexed, projecting, or semierect on the branch. Semierect cones, common only in this race of lodgepole pine, also are common in the closely related jack pine (Pinus banksiana), which overlaps and hybridizes with lodgepole pine in parts of western Canada. Semierect cones are present in some lodgepole stands remote from the region of overlap and may indicate earlier contacts between the two species during the Ice Age. Seeds are small, highly dispersible, retain their viability for many years in serotinous cones, and germinate rapidly without pretreatment. Seedlings have few cotyledons and juvenile growth is rapid. Local variations include a high frequency of three-needled fascicles in the Yukon, a possible Ice Age refugium of lodgepole pine, and (in stands in southern interior British Columbia and adjacent United States) the variable occurrence of thick bark, repeated stem forking, unusually fast juvenile growth, a low incidence of serotinous cones, or a high incidence of semierect cones. Sierra-Cascade Race (var. murrayana)- In its typical form (in the Sierra Nevada and other California mountains), this is the most distinctive race of lodgepole pine, but it intergrades with var. latifolia in the central and northern Cascades. It is inherently slow-growing in height, but diameter growth is more sustained than in other races. The trees have thin bark and reach much greater diameter-and probably greater ages- than elsewhere in the range of lodgepole pine. This race appears to have a stable ecological role and distribution that is not closely related to fire. The relatively short needles are the widest in the species. Seeds are by far the largest, and seedlings have more cotyledons than those of other races. Cones are lightweight and projecting or reflexed, with flattish scales. The cones open promptly at maturity and do not persist on the tree for long periods. Coastal Race (var. contorta)- The thick-barked trees are relatively small, short-lived, and inherently branchy. Now mostly confined to marginal sites (muskegs, dunes, serpentine soils, rocky sites), this race pioneered forest succession in the Pacific Coast region at the end of the lee Age. Needles are short, rather narrow, and have more stomata per unit area than the leaves of inland races. Flowering is abundant, and female strobili tend to mature earlier than the male. The cones are reflexed and persistent. Cones usually open not long after they mature, but serotiny is increasingly common toward the interior. Seeds are small to medium-sized, and germination is slower than that of the interior races. Early height growth nearly always is faster than that of inland populations at the same latitude. Local variations include a chemically distinctive northern muskeg ecotype extending south to western Washington. Mendocino White Plains Race (var. bolanderi)- This race,restricted to a narrow strip of highly acid podsol soils paralleling the coast of Mendocino County, CA, is probably an edaphic ecotype derived from the contiguous coastal race. Trees are dwarfed in nature but not when planted on other sites. Female strobili mature earlier than the males. Trees are extremely heavy pollen producers, and compared to coastal trees they produce high ratios of male to female strobili. The needles are short, narrow, and lacking in resin canals. Cones are reflexed, heavy, knobby, and often serotinous. Del Norte Race (not named)- This poorly known race has a limited distribution on serpentine and other ultramafic soils in the low coastal mountains of Del Norte County, northwestern California. Cones are heavier and more reflexed than those of any other race and often are serotinous. This group is geographically isolated from the others, but the composition of its cortex resin suggests that it may be an offshoot of the coastal race.",Population Differences,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Male and female strobili generally are home separately on the same tree in this monoecious species, with female flowers most often at the apical end of main branches in the upper crown, and male flowers on older lateral branches of the lower crown. The reddish purple female flowers grow in whorls of two to five and are 10 to 12 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) long. The pale yellow to yellowish orange male flowers are crowded clusters of catkins at the base of new shoots and are 8 to 14 mm (0.3 to 0.6 in) long. It is not uncommon to find a dominance of maleness or femaleness on individual trees. Pollen generally matures in mid-May to mid-July (table 1) (20,52). The time at which pollen matures appears to be related to elevation and climate. Seed cones usually mature in August, September, or October, more than a year after pollination. Inland forms and high elevation stands apparently mature earlier than coastal forms or low elevation stands. Cones open in early September in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Cone maturity is indicated by a change in color from purple-green to light brown (54). Seed Production and Dissemination- Lodgepole pine produces viable seed at an early age, commonly 5 to 10 years; germination percentage is as high as that of seed borne by mature trees. Pollen flowers have been observed on 2-0 seedlings in the Lucky Peak Nursery near Boise, ID. Lodgepole pine is a prolific seed producer. Good crops can be expected at 1- to 3-year intervals, with light crops intervening. The cones withstand below freezing temperatures and are not generally affected by cone- and seed-feeding insects. Only squirrels and coreid bugs are significant seed predators. Seed production should not be taken for granted, however. Complete seed crop failures have occurred at 2800 m (9,200 ft) in northwest Wyoming for 2 to 4 years in a row (42). Cone production of individual dominant and codominant trees can vary from a few hundred to a few thousand per tree (37). Cones are persistent, and serotinous (closed) cones accumulate for decades. Annual production may run from 173,000 to 790,000 seeds per hectare (70,000 to 320,000/acre) with half to one-third available for annual seedfall (27). An annual seedfall of 99,000 to 222,000 seeds per hectare (40,000 to 90,000/acre) was found in central Montana (58). These figures might be considered typical for interior lodgepole pine where some portion of the trees are of the serotinous type. In Oregon, where the nonserotinous cone habit is prevalent, seedfall ranged from about 35,000 to over 1.2 million/ha (14,000 to 500,000/acre) (21). Most years seedfall was on the order of hundreds of thousands per hectare. Where stored seeds are in the millions per hectare (in closed cones), the number of seeds stored is probably 10 times that of seeds produced annually (37). Although the number of fully developed seeds per cone varies from as few as 1 to 2 to as many as 50, a normal average for large cone lots in the Rocky Mountains is from 10 to 24 seeds per cone (42). Sierra Nevada populations range from 5 to 37 seeds per cone (20). The serotinous cone habit varies over wide geographic areas as well as locally (37). Serotinous cones are not common in eastern Oregon, rare in coastal populations, and absent in the Sierra Nevada and southern California and Baja California populations (20). Although common in the Rocky Mountains, this cone habit varies considerably (37). Many stands in the Rockies have less than 50 percent serotinous-cone trees. Lodgepole pine has long been regarded as a fire-maintained subclimax type. Its ability to regenerate in extremely dense stands to the exclusion of other species can be attributed to the closed cone habit. Millions of seeds per hectare are held in reserve for many years and are readily available to germinate on the seedbed prepared by fire. Recent evidence seems to indicate that fire selects strongly for the closed cone habit (49). Serotinous cones do not open at maturity because of a resinous bond between the cone scales. The bonds break with temperatures between 45° and 60° C (113° to 140° F) (48), and cone scales are then free to open hygroscopically. Large quantities of seeds are thus available for regenerating a stand following fire. Closed cones at or near the soil surface (less than 30 cm or about 12 in) are also subjected to temperatures from insolation sufficient to open them and may provide seed in harvested areas. Some seeds may be damaged by fire, however, particularly in fires burning in logging slash. Seeds stored in serotinous cones on the tree remain viable for years. Apparently, prolonged viability can be maintained so long as cones or seeds are not in contact with the ground. Once cones are on the ground, cones open. Damping-off fungi may infect the seed, rodents may feed on the seeds, or germination may occur; for the most part, seeds are not stored in the soil. Lodgepole pine has relatively small seeds for pine. Seed weights vary considerably, ranging from 2.3 mg (0.04 grains) per seed in the Interior of Canada to 11.4 mg (0.18 grains) per seed in the Sierra Nevada (20). Lodgepole pine seeds average about 298,000 cleaned seeds per kilogram (135,000/lb) for varieties contorta, 258,000/kg (117,000/lb) for murrayana, and 207,000/kg (94,000/lb) for latifolia (54). Density of seedfall 20 m (66 ft) from the timber edge is only 10 to 30 percent of that at the timber edge for stands in the Rocky Mountains (fig. 1) (42). Dispersal of sufficient seed to adequately restock an area often is only about 60 m (200 ft) (23,38). Prevailing winds, thermal effects, or scudding on the snow may disperse seeds far beyond these distances, however. Figure 1- Sound seed per hectare as a function of distance from the nearest timber edge. The annual seedfall from nonserotinous cones helps in restocking relatively minor disturbances in the stand, in maintaining the presence of lodgepole pine in mixed stands, and in expanding conifers into other vegetative types. Seldom do we find stands without some trees of the open-coned type. The efficacy of this seed source can be seen in the dense stands of lodgepole pine along road cuts, powerline rights-of-way, and ditches or where disturbance occurs near lodgepole pine stands. Studies of seedfall have shown variation in the number of seeds released soon after cone maturation, but most seeds (80 to 90 percent) are released before the following growing season (27). Where large amounts of seed are stored in serotinous cones, a most effective means of seed dispersal in clearcuts is from cones attached to the slash and those knocked from the slash and scattered over the forest floor during slash disposal. Many cones on or near the ground are opened by normal summer soil surface temperatures (35). In Montana 83 percent of the cones on the ground opened the first year on south slopes compared to 40 percent on north slopes. Maximum seed release from serotinous cones near the ground takes place during the first year of exposure. In fact, cones may open after the first few minutes of exposure to temperatures high enough to break the resinous bonds. In slash, serotinous cones that are well above the ground behave like those on a tree- they remain closed, and stored seeds remain viable for years. Seeds in unopened cones and those released from the slash may also be lost to rodents, fungi, and other destructive agents. Seeds from closed cones are usually available only for the first growing season following harvest, but stocking from open-cone seed sources can continue to increase for several years. Slash disposal on areas where regeneration is planned from serotinous cones must be carefully planned and executed. Seed supply will be largely destroyed if slash to be burned is piled before cones have had a chance to open (38). Piling slash should be delayed until sufficient cones have opened to assure adequate stocking. Piling then scatters seeds and opened cones and helps prepare the seedbed. Piling slash after germination can also decrease stocking because young seedlings are trampled or buried. Broadcast burning may hasten release of seeds from cones not in a position to open from high soil-surface temperatures. Some seeds will be destroyed, however; the amount will vary with fire intensity. Seedling Development- Germination under field conditions is good if climate and seedbed are favorable. Best germination occurs in full sunlight and on bare mineral soil or disturbed duff, free of competing vegetation. Germination is epigeal. Temperatures fluctuating between 8° and 26° C (47° and 78° F) favor germination. Adequate soil moisture is required for germination and survival during the critical few weeks following germination (34,51,55). In southwest Montana and southeast Idaho, 75 to 90 percent of a season's total germination occurred during the 2 weeks following snowmelt in late June (34), when the soil was saturated and temperatures were favorable. Germination can be delayed if cones do not open during the previous summer. Although lodgepole pine germinates well on most organic seedbeds, such materials tend to dry faster than mineral soil and seedlings often die in this seedbed. Lodgepole pine seeds have little need for stratification and germination depends largely upon temperature (20). At optimum temperatures and moisture, almost 100 percent of the seeds germinate rapidly. Both shading and competition inhibit germination and survival. Newly germinated seedlings are relatively insensitive to temperature extremes. Because residual overstory following partial cutting usually does not provide the most favorable conditions for regeneration, clearcutting is generally recommended. On some areas, however, lodgepole pine has established itself in the shade of lightly cut or uneven-aged stands and may persist for many years in the understory. Some of these trees eventually may establish a crown sufficient to permit reasonable growth. Drought is a common cause of mortality among first-year seedlings; losses vary with soil type and seedbed condition. Greatest losses occur on soils with low water-holding capacity, and duff and litter. Well decomposed organic material, incorporated in the soil, enhances seedling survival, however. Disturbed mineral soil seedbeds generally produce the best germination and survival (34,40,41). Shading has been demonstrated to help under drought conditions in Wyoming (10). Drought losses usually decline considerably after the first growing season. First-year seedlings are particularly vulnerable because of a relatively shallow root system (34,47). Young, succulent seedlings may die because of high soil surface temperatures (13). By 2 to 4 weeks of age, seedlings are able to withstand soil surface temperatures higher than 60° C (140° F), which commonly occur at high elevation sites. Freezing temperatures may kill seedlings either directly or by frost heaving. In much of the range of lodgepole pine, however, frosts occur regularly throughout the growing season and seedlings from different sources vary in frost resistance (16). The amount of frost heaving varies considerably by soil type, location, and year of occurrence but can cause significant losses. Lodgepole pine seedlings are poor competitors and competition from grass is often most detrimental. The Douglas-fir/pinegrass habitat type is one of the most difficult sites for lodgepole pine regeneration, particularly if the regeneration effort is delayed until a firm sod cover is established. Grazing animals, particularly cattle, can cause seedling mortality by trampling. Sheep actually seek the succulent new ""candles"" in the spring and nibble needles and small branches if other feed is not abundant. A common problem of regenerating lodgepole pine stands is overstocking, which results in stagnation at early ages. Many sites are stocked with tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of trees per hectare. If trees are well distributed, stocking should not exceed 1,240 to 1,980 stems per hectare (500 to 800/acre) between 5 years and 20 years of age (17). Proper distribution and full utilization of the site, however, may require establishment of 2,470/ha (1,000/acre) and thinning to obtain proper spacing. There is also potential for significant genetic gains from selection of elite trees when thinning. An average height of 3.6 m (12 ft) and d.b.h. of 5 cm (2 in) on fully stocked 20-year-old stands was found on above average sites in Montana (27). Average heights of 2.0 m (6.7 ft), 4.2 m (13.8 ft), and 7.6 m (24.9 ft) were found on low, medium, and high sites in 20-year-old stands in the Foothills Section of Alberta (for density class 1,240 stems per hectare or 500/acre at 70 years of age) (32). Lodgepole pine height growth begins earlier than any of its associates except other pines and larch (53). Vegetative Reproduction- Lodgepole pine can be grafted successfully, but results vary depending upon the clone (20). Natural sprouting has been observed on the Bitterroot National Forest in Montana. Branches not severed often become leaders on stumps left in thinning operations. Lodgepole pine cuttings are relatively easy to root. Adventitious roots have been developed artificially from 8-year-old lodgepole pine (by air-layering) after treatment with either indole-acetic or indole-butyric acid (17). Callus tissue cultures and liquid cell suspensions have been produced from seedling hypocotyl tissue, excised embryos, and actively growing shoots.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,13,1
"Because lodgepole pine has little taper and thin bark it produces a higher volume of wood for a given diameter and height than many of its associates. Natural pruning is relatively poor, but limbs generally are of small diameter and lumber yields are good. Growth and Yield- Growth and yield of lodgepole pine is greatly affected by stand density (31) as well as by environmental factors (2,6,22,46). In fact, site index curves have been developed with corrections for effects of stand density. Maximum yield in the Rocky Mountains was 280 m³/ha (20,000 fbm/acre) at a density of 1,980 trees per hectare (800/acre), but only 21 m³/ha (1,500 fbm/acre) at a density of 4,450/ha (1,800/acre), assuming 5 fbm/ft³; original figures were in board feet (27). In extreme cases 70-year-old stands with 247,000 trees/ha (100,000 trees/acre) averaged only 1.2 m (4 ft) in height and less than 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter at ground level. Yields of 168 to 224 m³/ha (about 12,000 to 16,000 fbm/acre) can be found in old-growth Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine. Yields of more than 336 m³/ha (about 24,000 fbm/acre) are the result of a fortuitous combination of favorable initial stocking, good site quality, and absence of mountain pine beetle and dwarf mistletoe. Relationships among age, stocking levels, and development in natural stands were summarized for medium sites in Montana and Idaho (site index 22.9 m or 75 ft at 100 years) (table 2). Under light to moderate stocking, live crowns are 25 to 60 percent of total height. Mature sizes vary greatly between stands. In the Rocky Mountains, most trees at 140 years of age were 18 to 33 cm (about 7 to 13 in) in d.b.h. and 18 to 25 m (about 60 to 80 ft) in height (27). Trees in the Blue Mountains of Oregon average 30 cm (about 12 in) in d.b.h. and 23 m (about 75 ft) tall at 100 years of age. Sierra Nevada trees the same age are larger, averaging 42 cm (about 16 to 17 in) in d.b.h. and 28 to 30 m (about 90 to 100 ft) tall. Coastal trees are smaller but vary greatly. Mature trees range from 15 to 50 cm (about 6 to 20 in) in d.b.h. and only 6 to 12 m (20 to 40 ft) tall. Dwarf lodgepole pines are only about a meter (2 to 5 ft) tall and are found along the coast in Mendocino County, CA. This small size is thought to be caused by a highly acid hardpan. Growth of lodgepole pine is often so stagnant that stand culture is not practical. Early management and control of stocking greatly affects growth and yield of lodgepole pine stands (17). Average annual growth in old-growth unmanaged stands in the central Rocky Mountains only was 0.4 to 0.6 m³/ha (about 25 to 40 fbm/acre) because of large numbers of small trees and a high incidence of dwarf mistletoe (4). (Calculations assume 5 fbm/ft³; original figures were in board feet). Annual net growth may be increased to 2.1 to 5.6 m³/ha (about 150 to 400 fbm/acre) by controlling stand density and reducing dwarf mistletoe infection (5,25). Control of stand density offers the greatest opportunity for increasing productivity of any readily available management practice. Culmination of total cubic volume occurs as early as 40 years in severely stagnated stands, and between 50 and 80 years for overstocked, but not greatly stagnated, stands. Merchantable volume culmination in stands of the latter type occurs between 110 and 140 years, depending on merchantability standards. Thinning of young overstocked and stagnating stands can restore growth potential and redirect it into merchantable-size products. With more complete utilization (lower merchantable d.b.h. and top diameters), most of the yield increase possible from thinning is attained with the first entry, a stocking control thinning (17). Rooting Habit- The root system of lodgepole pine varies considerably in form, depending on soil type. Root growth is particularly important during the critical first year. Root growth of 12.7 to 15.2 cm (5 to 6 in) was reported for seedlings growing on prepared seedbeds in Montana and Idaho (34). First-season seedlings had an average root depth of only 9.6 cm (3.8 in) on scarified, unshaded seedbeds in the central Rocky Mountains (47). Seedlings growing near grass competition usually do not penetrate beyond 5 or 6 cm (about 2 in). Taproots and vertical sinkers are common, but where a hardpan or water table is encountered, the taproot may die, bend, or assume a horizontal position. Planting may affect root configuration. Taproots of seedlings planted with ""J-roots"" often grow horizontally for many years before sinkers develop. Because of its shallow root system, lodgepole pine is susceptible to windfall, particularly after stands are opened by harvesting. Windfirmness varies with stand density, soil conditions, and topography. Shallow roots are common above hardpan or in shallow, rocky soils. Reaction to Competition- Lodgepole pine is very intolerant of shade and competition from other plant species. Occasionally seedlings become established under a forest canopy, but these individuals rarely do well. In spite of its shade intolerance, lodgepole pine maintains itself in dense stands for long periods, often for 100 years or more. In the absence of fire, lodgepole pine is usually succeeded by its more tolerant associates, such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. Succession proceeds at variable rates, however, and is particularly slow in some high elevation forests. Pure stands of lodgepole pine persist for varying lengths of time. In northern Idaho and central Oregon, stands begin to break up at 80 to 100 years, while stands at higher elevations, such as in Montana, southern Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, last for several hundred years. Pure stands in and around Yellowstone National Park contain 300- to 400-year-old trees, with several groups of younger even-aged trees. These stands no doubt originated as even-aged stands but have been breaking up for more than two centuries. The ability of lodgepole pine to regenerate at the expense of other species is due not only to cone serotiny but also to seed viability, germinative energy, early rapid growth, and ability to survive a wide variety of microsite and soil situations (39). Compared to its associates, lodgepole pine is intermediate in its needs for water, requiring more than Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine and less than Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. On some sites, lodgepole pine appears to compete well for water, however, and grows where other species may be excluded because of lack of water (45,57); on others it appears to be tolerant of high water tables (14,43). It is also intermediate in its tolerance to extremes of temperature (27). Lodgepole pine shows good response to thinning at an early age (17). Heavily stocked stands must be thinned before stagnation occurs. The best age for thinning varies with site and density. Poor sites and overstocked stands particularly must be thinned as early as age 10. Diameter growth acceleration is usually greatest in heavy thinnings; cubic volume and basal area growth are usually greatest in light thinnings (27). Although mechanical thinning, as with bulldozer strips, is a convenient alternative, obtaining a proper response (36) is difficult. At older ages, growth response is strongly correlated with crown size, vigor, and amount of release provided (27). Attempts at partial cutting of mature and over-mature stands have resulted in little gain or even negative net volume growth (1,28). Lodgepole pine can be maintained best in a vigorous, productive forest by using a silvicultural method that regenerates even-aged stands (38). This often may be accomplished by clearcutting and by relying upon natural regeneration or planting. Planting provides an excellent opportunity for initial stocking control and/or genetic improvement. Damaging Agents- The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is the most severe insect pest of lodgepole pine. The epidemics that periodically occur in many lodgepole pine stands seriously affect the sustained yield and regulation of managed stands. Adult beetles attack lodgepole pine in July or August, introducing bluestain fungi (8). The beetles construct egg galleries in the phloem where larvae feed and together with the fungi, girdle and kill the tree. Larvae overwinter in the tree, complete development, and emerge as adult beetles in the spring. Harvesting has been considered as a means of preventing mountain pine beetle epidemics (19). Silvicultural practices in an integrated program for controlling losses to mountain pine beetle have been suggested (9,18). No mortality occurred in heavily thinned stands in Oregon where vigor ratings were high (44). The mountain pine beetle has played an historic role in the dynamics of lodgepole pine ecosystems. By periodically invading stands and creating large amounts of fuels, which are eventually consumed by fire, creating favorable conditions for regeneration (12,39), the beetle has increased the probability that lodgepole pine will reoccupy the site at the expense of other species. Another aggressive bark beetle that attacks lodgepole pine is the pine engraver (Ips pini). Ips commonly develops in logging slash, especially slash that is shaded and does not dry quickly. Prompt slash disposal is an effective control measure. Ips also can build up in windthrows. Other insects that can be damaging local pests are the lodgepole terminal weevil (Pissodes terminalis), which can be destructive to elongating terminal leaders; larvae of the Warren's collar weevil (Hylobius warreni), which girdles roots and the root collar; larvae of the weevil Magdalis gentilis, which mine branches; various sucking insects, such as the pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), the black pineleaf scale (Nuculaspis californica), and the spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis); and several defoliating insects, among which are the lodgepole sawfly (Neodiprion burkei), the lodgepole needle miner (Coleotechnites milleri), the sugar pine tortrix (Choristoneura lambertiana), the pine tube moth (Argyrotaenia pinatubana), and the pandora moth (Coloradia pandora) (7). Dwarf mistletoe (particularly Arceuthobium americanum) is the most widespread and serious parasite affecting lodgepole pine (11,29). A. americanum seeds are forcibly ejected from the fruit for distances as great as 9 m (about 30 ft). The sticky seeds adhere to the foliage of potential host trees. The proportion of trees visibly infected can double each 5 years between the ages of 10 and 25, with nearly a third of the trees infected at age 25 (29). Rate of spread in young stands is about 0.3 to 0.5 m (1.0 to 1.5 ft) per year, with the fastest rate in dense stands. In many areas, more than 50 percent of lodgepole pine forests are infected. Dwarf mistletoe infection results in reduced diameter and height growth, increased mortality, reduced wood quality, decreased seed production, and overall decreased vigor. Both harvesting and fire can greatly lessen the rate of spread and rates of infection. Effective control can be accomplished by clearcutting and locating boundaries of the unit to minimize reinfection from surrounding stands. Fire can effectively limit spread of dwarf mistletoe by eliminating sources of infection and establishing vast acreages of dwarf mistletoe-free areas. Lodgepole pine is subject to attack by many fungal pathogens (33). These fungi are responsible for reduced growth and considerable cull and mortality. They also contribute in no small measure to the large amounts of logging residues that commonly occur when lodgepole pine is harvested. One of the most serious diseases in lodgepole pine is a stem canker caused by Atropellis piniphila. Cankered stems are usually useless for lumber or posts and poles. Stem cankers of rust fungi cause extensive mortality, growth loss, and cull in lodgepole pine. Of these comandra blister rust (Cronartium comandrae) is the most serious. The western gall rust (Peridermium harknessii) is especially damaging; trunk cankers can cause cull in logs and can kill seedlings and saplings. Because this rust does not require an alternate host, it can directly reinfect pines. Other fungi attack lodgepole pine and may cause serious losses in wood production. Examples are needle casts (such as Elytroderma deformans and Lophodermella concolor); root rots (such as Armillaria mellea and Heterobasidion annosum); and wood decays (such as Phellinus pini and Peniophora pseudo-pini). Seed and seedling diseases are not usually damaging, although locally several mold fungi are associated with seed losses in germination, and rotting and damping-off can affect young seedlings. Because of its relatively thin bark, lodgepole pine is more susceptible to fire than Douglas-fir and many other associates. It is less susceptible than Engelmann spruce or subalpine fir. Mortality from beetle epidemics often creates large amounts of jackstrawed fuel, which ignites easily from lightning and other sources and hampers fire control efforts. Chinook winds following extremely cold weather occasionally cause red belt injury, particularly in Canada and Montana. Defoliation of trees is common and mortality can occur over large areas. Heavy snow can break or bend trees, particularly in dense stands with narrow crowns and intense root competition. Thinning can contribute to snow breakage, particularly if previously dense stands are opened suddenly. Animals can cause considerable damage in thinned stands in some areas. Porcupines were attracted to thinned and fertilized stands in Montana. Pocket gophers often cover small seedlings under their entrance mounds and ""winter-casts."" They also feed on or clip both roots and tops. Gopher populations often explode as vegetation increases in open areas.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,14,1
"Lodgepole pine grows on soils that vary widely but are usually moist. Growth is best where soil parent materials are granites, shales, and coarse-grained lavas (24,27); other soils have developed from glacial till of widely varying composition, Recent, Tertiary, and Oligocene alluvium and colluvium (from such sources as quartzites and argillites), limestone of the Belt geologic series, pumice, and volcanic ash. Lodgepole pine is seldom found on the generally drier soils derived from limestone. In Canada, however, extensive stands occur on calcareous glacial tills (56). Glacial drift provides a balance of moisture and porosity on which the species seems to thrive, as in Alberta, where it grows better on glacial tills than on alluvial soils or lacustrine deposits. In Montana, highly calcareous soils derived from dolomitic limestone usually do not support lodgepole pine, subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), although they do support Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca). Nevertheless, soils developed in colluvium from other types of limestone and calcareous glacial till do support stands of lodgepole pine. Extensive stands of lodgepole pine (var. latifolia) occur on soils classified as Inceptisols or Alfisols in the interior forests. Although the species commonly grows on Andepts and does well on these soils in some areas, the Boralfs and Ochrepts probably support better tree development and more extensive stands. Frequently lodgepole pine soils on Boralfs and Ochrepts have cryic soil temperature regimes. In the Blue Mountains of Oregon lodgepole pine does well on Andepts, where it is nearly always found on volcanic ash or alluvial material overlying residual basaltic soils, at elevations between 910 and 2130 m (3,000 and 7,000 ft). The ash cap soils are deeper and hold more moisture than the residual soils. The coastal form of lodgepole pine (var. contorta) is often found on Histosols (peat bogs or muskegs) in southeastern Alaska, British Columbia, and western Washington, and on dry, sandy, or gravelly sites farther south along the coast on Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Ultisols. Soil properties and soil moisture often favor lodgepole pine locally over other species. Lodgepole pine grows on wet flats and poorly drained soils in the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon, and the Sierra Nevada in California. Soils with underlying hardpan support lodgepole pine to the exclusion of such species as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), or Douglas-fir in the Sierra Nevada, eastern Oregon, and Mendocino County, CA. Lodgepole pine also grows on level sites with and without high water tables in central Oregon where frost tolerance during germination allows its establishment to the exclusion of other species. Extensive stands are found in these areas on well drained sites above 1600 m (5,250 ft), with patterns of occurrence attributed to past fires. On infertile soils, lodgepole pine is often the only tree species that will grow. Nevertheless, experiments have demonstrated significant growth increase from fertilization, particularly nitrogen (15). Lodgepole pine thrives in a wide variety of topographic situations. It grows well on gentle slopes and in basins, but good stands are also found on rough and rocky terrain and on steep slopes and ridges, including bare gravel. Northern and eastern slopes are more favorable than southern and western aspects (3).",Soils and Topography,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,15,1
"Lodgepole pine is not only an important timber species but is also a major tree cover in many scenic and recreational areas and on critical watersheds. It provides many acres of wildlife habitat and is associated with many grazing allotments throughout its range. It is important to local communities throughout the West. Lodgepole pine is used for framing, paneling, posts, corral poles, utility poles, railroad ties, and pulpwood. As new developments such as structural particleboard become practical, the rapid juvenile growth of the species will be an advantage where gross cubic volume becomes important. Even now, with properly designed machinery, it is economically harvested, and this harvesting, properly done, can enhance watershed, forage, wildlife habitat, and scenic and recreational values.",Special Uses,Lodgepole Pine,pinus,contorta,conifer,16,1
"The principal longleaf cover types are Longleaf Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 70), Longleaf Pine-Scrub Oak (Type 71), and Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Type 83) (12). Longleaf pine is also a minor component of other forest types within its range: Sand Pine (Type 69), Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Loblolly Pine (Type 81), Loblolly Pine-Hardwoods (Type 82), Slash Pine (Type 84), and South Florida Slash Pine (Type 111). Longleaf pine develops in close association with periodic surface fires. The vegetation associated with longleaf pine reflects the frequency and severity of burning. In the past, frequent fires resulted in open, parklike stands of longleaf with few other woody plants and a ground cover dominated by grasses. Ground cover in longleaf pine in the Coastal Plains can be separated into two general regions, with the division in the central part of south Alabama and northwest Florida. To the west, bluestem (Andropogon spp.) and panicum (Panicum spp.) grasses predominate; to the east, wiregrass (pineland threeawn, Aristida stricta) is most common. With a reduction in fire occurrence, hardwoods and other pines encroach on the longleaf forest. Within the range of slash pine (Pinus elliottii), this species becomes increasingly important, leading to the cover type Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine. Elsewhere loblolly and shortleaf pines (P. taeda and P. echinata) as well as hardwoods gradually replace the longleaf, eventually resulting in Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82) or occasionally Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80). On poor, dry sandhills and mountain ridges, scrub hardwoods invade the understory creating forest cover type Longleaf Pine-Scrub Oak and finally Southern Scrub Oak (Type 72) as the pine disappears (12). Hardwoods most closely associated with longleaf pine on mesic Coastal Plain sites include southern red, blackjack, and water oaks (Quercus falcata, Q. marilandica, and Q. nigra); flowering dogwood (Cornus florida); blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica); sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua); persimmon (Diospyros virginiana); and sassafras (Sassafras albidum). The more common shrubs include gallberry (Ilex glabra), yaupon (I. vomitoria), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), shining sumac (Rhus copallina), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), huckleberry (Gaylussacia spp.), and blackberry (Rubus spp.). On xeric sandhill sites, the most common associates are turkey, bluejack, blackjack, sand post, and dwarf live oaks Quercus laevis, Q. incana, Q. marilandica, Q. stellata var. margaretta, and Q. minima). On the dry clay hills and mountains of Alabama, blackjack, post (Q. stellata) and southern red oaks, and mockernut hickory (Carya tomentosa) are found with longleaf pine. On low, wet flatwood sites near the coast, the most conspicuous understory plants are gallberry and saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens). Other common understory plants in low, wet Longleaf Pine or Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine types are sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), large gallberry (Ilex coriacea), buckwheat-tree (Cliftonia monophylla), blueberries, and blackberries.",Associated Forest Cover,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,1,1
"Longleaf pine grows in warm, wet temperate climates characterized by hot summers and mild winters. Annual mean temperatures range from 16° to 23° C (60° to 74° F) and annual precipitation from 1090 to 1750 mm (43 to 69 in), the least being 1090 to 1270 mm (43 to 50 in) in the Carolinas and Texas and the greatest along the Gulf Coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and extreme west Florida. A distinct summer rainfall peak occurs along the Atlantic Coast, being most pronounced in Florida. A secondary rainfall peak in March becomes pronounced along the Gulf Coast. Fall is the driest season of the year, although droughts during the growing season are not unusual.",Climate,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,2,1
"The major southern pines, as well as some minor species, are closely related and have overlapping ranges. Natural hybridization has contributed to genetic diversity among trees and populations. Natural hybridization is common between longleaf and loblolly pine, producing the Sonderegger pine (P. x sondereggeri H. H. Chapm.). This is the only named southern pine hybrid. Throughout much of the longleaf pine range, the flowering of longleaf and loblolly pines overlaps in most years so there is no phenological barrier to natural crossing. Natural hybridization between longleaf and slash pine is unlikely, based on differences between the species in dormancy and heat requirements for flowering (5). Artificial crosses between longleaf pine and both loblolly and slash pines can be achieved easily. Crosses between longleaf and shortleaf pine have not been found in nature but have been produced artificially. There are no reported successful crosses of longleaf pine with any other pine species (28).",Hybrids,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,9,1
"The natural range of longleaf pine includes most of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from southeastern Virginia to eastern Texas and south through the northern two-thirds of peninsular Florida.

"Longleaf pine is a highly variable species, and a considerable proportion of this variation is genetic. Considering the economically important traits, longleaf pines have as much or more genetic variation than other southern pines. Variation among individual trees is greater than that among stands or among geographically diverse seed sources (23,28). Nevertheless, the diversity of environments throughout the longleaf range has promoted the development of genetic variation among populations. According to rangewide provenance tests, trees from coastal areas usually outgrow those from inland areas at all but the coldest locations. Trees originating from the central Gulf Coast should be more productive than trees from other sources on most coastal plain longleaf sites from Georgia and north Florida west to east central Louisiana (28). Elsewhere, local seed sources may be safest to use until more information is available.",Population Differences,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Like all species in the pine family, longleaf pine is monoecious. The strobili of longleaf pine, both male (catkins) and female (conelets), are initiated during the growing season before buds emerge. Catkins may begin forming in July, while conelets are formed during a relatively short period of time in August. The number of flowers produced is apparently related to weather conditions during the year of initiation. A wet spring and early summer followed by a dry period in late summer promotes conelet production (27). Catkin production, however, is favored by abundant rainfall throughout the growing season. Female strobili are borne most frequently in the upper crown, and male strobili predominate in the lower crown (26). Late summer rainfall depresses conelet initiation, probably because vigorous exposed shoots in the middle and upper crown continue to grow. In the lower crown, where most catkins are home, shoots stop growing earlier than they do in the upper crown. Since rainfall patterns associated with catkin initiation differ from those favoring conelets, large crops of male and female flowers do not necessarily coincide. Ten years of observation did not show any correlation between size of conelet and pollen crops in longleaf pine. Variable but usually heavy annual losses of longleaf pine conelets can be expected; observed losses have ranged from 65 to 100 percent (2,24,30). Several agents, alone or in combination, may be responsible. The more important appear to be insects, bad weather, and insufficient pollen. Over 15 years at one location, cone production was related to pollen density, to the point of a sufficiency of pollen (2). Further increases in pollen density had little effect. In some cases, nearly all the losses have been attributed to insects (24), while in others the more common causes of conelet losses were not responsible (30). Most conelet losses seem to occur in the spring, at about the time of pollination, although substantial losses may also occur in the summer (24). Most of the spontaneous conelet abortions in longleaf pine may result from excess ethylene production by foliage and shoots. A foliar spray with anti-ethylene compounds soon after anthesis has reduced conelet abortion by half, doubling seed yields (18). Catkin buds normally emerge in November, then remain dormant for about a month before growth resumes. Conelet buds emerge in January or February. The rate of development of both conelets and catkins thereafter is almost entirely dependent on ambient temperature. Catkins are purple from the time they emerge from the buds until they shed their pollen. Upon emerging from the bud, conelets are red until they are pollinated, after which they gradually fade to a yellowish green. Most mature catkins range from 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 in) in length. The average date of peak pollen shed and conelet receptivity may range from late February in the southern part of longleaf pines' range to early April toward the northern limits. Most locations may experience flowering dates close to these extremes. The date of peak pollen shed and conelet receptivity coincides on individual longleaf pine trees but can vary considerably among trees in a stand. Some trees are consistently early and others late in time of flowering, although the differences vary from year to year, depending on air temperatures before and during the flowering period (5). Over 22 years of observation, the time required for shedding 80 percent of all pollen in a longleaf pine stand ranged from 5 to 21 days and averaged 13 (5). Pollination takes place in the late winter or spring, but fertilization does not occur until the following spring. At this time conelets are growing rapidly, increasing in length from about 2.5 cm (1 in) in February to about 18 cm (7 in) by May or June (16). Mature cones range in length from 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 in). Cones reach maturity between mid-September and mid-October of their second year. Cones, as they become ripe, change color from green to dull brown, although cones may be ripe before the color change (26). The specific gravity of ripe cones ranges from 0.80 to 0.89. Ripeness can be tested by flotation in SAE 20 motor oil; ripe cones will float but those not yet ripe will sink (26). Seed Production and Dissemination- Tree size, crown class, stand density, site quality, and, most important, genetic predisposition, all affect cone production by an individual tree. The best cone producers are dominant, open grown trees with large crowns, 38 cm. (15 in) or more in d.b.h., with a past record of good cone production (11). Trees 38 to 48 cm (15 to 19 in) in d.b.h. have produced an average of 65 cones annually compared to 15 cones by trees from 25 to 33 cm (10 to 13 in) in d.b.h. The number of sound seeds per cone varies widely and is related to size of seed crop in a particular year. In good seed years there may be about 50 seeds per cone, in average years 35, and in poor years 15 (10). Seed production per hectare reaches a peak at stand densities between 6.9 and 9.2 m²/ha (30 to 40 ft²/acre) of basal area, assuming that the stand is comprised of dominant-codominant trees of cone bearing size (3). A shelterwood stand with a basal area of 6.9 m²/ha (30 ft²/acre) produces three times as many cones per unit area as a stand of scattered seed trees averaging 2.3 m²/ha (10 ft²/acre) in good seed years (11). Throughout its range, longleaf pine in shelterwood stands produces seed crops adequate for natural regeneration, about 2,500 cones per hectare (1,000/acre), on the average of once every 4 to 5 years (11). However, everything else being equal, good cone crops are more frequent in some parts of the longleaf pine range than in others, so the general average may be meaningless at a given location. The production of female strobili is much less variable from place-to-place than is the production of mature cones, indicating that geographic differences in cone production are due more to conelet and cone losses than failure to produce conelets in the first place (7). When a shelterwood stand is created by cutting back a stand of substantially higher density, increased cone production resulting from release does not occur until the end of the third growing season after cutting (9). Release that occurs after conelet initiation has no effect on that crop, other than promoting better conelet survival through reduced stress in dry periods. Seeds are dispersed by the wind. Seed dispersal begins in late October and continues through November, with the majority falling within a period of 2 to 3 weeks. The time and duration of seed dispersal vary depending on weather conditions. Dispersal range is limited, with 71 percent of sound seeds falling within a distance of 20 m (66 ft) of the base of parent trees (11). Longleaf seeds are the largest of the southern pines. The number of cleaned seeds ranges from 6,600 to 15,400/kg (3,000 to 7,000/lb), averaging 10,800/kg (4,900/lb) (26). Seedling Development- Longleaf pine differs from other southern pines in that seeds germinate soon after they are dispersed. Given optimum conditions, seeds germinate in less than a week after they reach the ground. Prompt germination reduces the period of exposure to seed predators, but newly germinated seedlings are susceptible to damage or loss from animals, diseases, and weather uncertainties, which may include high fall temperatures, drought, or extreme cold with a risk of frost heaving in heavy soils (11). Seeds require contact with mineral soil for satisfactory germination and establishment. Longleaf seeds, with their large wings, cannot easily reach mineral soil through a heavy cover of grass and litter. The accumulated material must be removed before seedfall, either mechanically or by burning. Burning within a year of seedfall normally provides an adequate seedbed. Lack of seedbed preparation can result in a regeneration failure. Germination of longleaf pine seed is epigeal (26). Newly germinated seedlings have virtually no above-ground hypocotyl, and the cotyledons are close to the ground line. The primary needles appear after germination and the secondary needles about 2 months later. The epicotyl, or stem above the cotyledons, does not elongate rapidly as in most other pines. Even in the nursery, seedlings are virtually stemless after one growing season (16). This stemless condition is one of the unique characteristics of longleaf pine. It is referred to as a grass stage and may last 2 to many years, depending on growth conditions. During this time, longleaf is most susceptible to its major disease, the brown-spot needle blight, Scirrhia acicola (11). While in the grass stage, seedlings develop extensive root systems. Growth can be followed by observing the increase in root-collar diameter. When it approaches 2.5 cm (1 in), active height growth is imminent. Grass-stage seedlings, once they reach 0.8 cm (0.3 in) in root-collar diameter, are highly resistant to fire, even during the growing season. Seedlings in early height growth, up to a height of about 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft), become susceptible to damage by fire. Once beyond this stage, longleaf pines are again fire resistant. Competition and brown-spot needle blight have great impact on the rate of seedling development and together largely determine the duration of the grass stage. Longleaf seedlings can be easily established and usually survive for years under an overstory of parent pines. Growth, however, is very slow. Seedlings respond promptly with an increased rate of growth when released from overstory competition. Growth rate varies widely among individuals in a natural seedling stand, and vigorous fast-growing seedlings express dominance early. The rapid breakup of a seedling stand into a wide range of size classes reduces the risk of stand stagnation. About 10 percent of a natural seedling stand shows resistance to the brown-spot disease, and this gives them a growth advantage that persists for many years. At age 24, trees that had little or no brown-spot infection averaged 2.4 in (8 ft) taller than trees that had 30 percent or more of their foliage destroyed by the disease as seedlings (1). A low level of competition permits early initiation of height growth. One longleaf pine plantation on a prepared site had nearly 60 percent of the trees in active height growth by the end of the second growing season, and over 90 percent by the end of the third. Early initiation of height growth circumvented a brown-spot problem as the disease did not have time to build up to serious proportions. Vegetative Reproduction- Longleaf pine seedlings, if top killed, can sprout from the root collar. Sprouting ability decreases sharply when seedlings begin height growth. In one study, almost 40 percent of seedlings cut off at the ground line during grass stage had living sprouts a year later. Only 14 percent of seedlings up to 1.37 m (4.5 ft) in height so treated developed sprouts, however, and those larger than this did not sprout at all (14). Longleaf is not as easy to reproduce asexually as some of the other southern pines. Cuttings can be rooted but the process is difficult. Air-layering has met with limited success. Grafting has proven to be a reliable technique, and this is now the most common method of establishing seed orchards (28).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Longleaf pine is a high quality timber tree, well suited to a whole range of products-poles, piling, posts, sawlogs, plywood, pulpwood, and naval stores. Longleaf naturally prunes itself well. Most stems are well formed, straight, and largely free of branches. The species almost always has higher stemwood specific gravities and produces more dry wood per unit volume than either loblolly or slash pine (28). Intense exploitation since colonial days, plus lack of planned regeneration, contributed to the decline of longleaf pine forests that continues to this day. Once height growth has begun, the species can grow as well as the other major southern pines on many sites originally occupied by longleaf, and often exceeds them in growth. The critical element in the growth of longleaf pine stands is the duration of the grass stage. About 70 percent of the variation among plantations in the form of height-over-age curves was related to the condition of the planting site: early height growth on unprepared cutover sites was much slower than on old fields and mechanically prepared cutover sites (6). Reduction of competing ground cover in grass stage seedling stands can have a large impact on growth and future volume yields. One study (25) observed the effects of a single aerial application of 2,4,5-T to stands of 1-year-old longleaf seedlings. Twenty years later, treated stands had significantly greater tree diameter (10 percent), height (17 percent), and total volume per unit area (32 percent) than adjacent untreated stands, although there was no difference in the number of trees per unit area. Treated stands averaged 83.5 m³/ha (1,193 ft³/acre) total inside-bark (i.b.) volume, compared to 63.2 m³/ha (904 ft³/acre) for untreated stands. Longleaf pine growth and yield predictions have been published for periodically thinned even-aged natural stands (15) and also for unthinned plantations in the west Gulf region (22). Predicted total volume (i.b.) yields for two common site index classes are given in table 1. The merchantable proportion of total volume ranges from 78 to 86 percent at age 20, to 97 to 98 percent at age 40. The peak in periodic annual increment is reached between ages 20 and 30. The optimum stand density to maintain by periodic thinning varies by site and management goals. A rather broad range of stand densities, above a basal area of about 13.8 m²/ha (60 ft²/acre), produces near maximum periodic volume growth (13). Lower densities concentrate growth on fewer trees. Longleaf responds well to release provided by thinning if the released trees have crowns equal to at least one-third to one-half of total tree height. Small-crowned intermediate or suppressed trees do not respond promptly to release. Thinning should be from below to release well-formed dominant and codominant trees. Present indications are that longleaf pine plantations should produce volume growth similar to natural stands if other factors are equal. To the extent that plantations have had better competition control, with consequent acceleration of early growth, a particular volume yield should be reached at an earlier age in plantations than in natural stands. Rooting Habit- Longleaf pine develop massive taproots that, in mature trees, may extend to a depth of 2.4 to 3.7 m (8 to 12 ft) or more. A hardpan can arrest downward growth of the taproot. If the hardpan is close to the surface, windfirmness of the tree is reduced. Longleaf pines develop extensive lateral root systems. Most lateral roots are within 0.3 m (1 ft), and nearly all within 0.6 m (2 ft), of the surface (29). Reaction to Competition- Longleaf pine is intolerant of competition, whether for light or for moisture and nutrients. The species will grow best in the complete absence of all competition, including that from other members of the species. Fortunately, as noted earlier, young even-age longleaf pine stands break up rapidly into a broad range of size classes, due to variability in duration of the grass stage. Stagnation is almost never a problem. However, even suppressed trees in a stand will slow the growth of dominant neighbors. Optimum stand density for development of crop trees needs to be maintained by periodic thinning. Given release from neighboring trees, dominant and codominant trees in an over-dense stand will respond promptly with increased diameter growth, as will some intermediate trees that retain crown ratios of 30 percent or more. Suppressed trees, while they may continue to live, rarely respond to release with improved growth. Damaging Agents- Longleaf pine is less susceptible to most damaging agents than the other southern pines and is a relatively low risk species to manage. It is strongly resistant to fire, except as a small seedling of less than 0.8 cm (0.3 in) root collar diameter and in early height growth. It is also resistant to most pathogenic agents. The major disease is the brown-spot needle blight. This disease causes serious damage only to grass-stage seedlings. Continued severe defoliation by brown-spot suppresses and eventually destroys seedlings. Once rapid height growth begins, seedlings are no longer seriously afflicted. Seedlings growing in the open are most vulnerable, particularly if the groundcover is sparse; the disease usually does not seriously affect seedlings growing under a pine overstory. Other diseases occasionally of economic importance in local areas are pitch canker (Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans), annosus root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) in thinned plantations, cone rust (Cronartium strobilinum) near the coast, and also the condition known as dry face of turpentined trees. Fusiform rust (Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme) is rarely a problem for longleaf pine (20). Many species of birds, mice, and squirrels feed on longleaf pine seeds, the latter often taking them from unripe cones. Several species of ants feed on germinating seeds and cotyledon seedlings. Cottontails as well as other predators can destroy newly established seedlings. Grass-stage seedlings are vulnerable to destruction by hogs, pales weevil (Hylobius pales), and heavy livestock grazing. Pocket gophers cut seedlings off just below the ground surface. Most seedling losses occur during the first year after establishment, untimely drought being the greatest single hazard. Logging of the overstory can destroy close to 50 percent of a seedling stand, although actual damage depends on type and season of logging, volume removed, and seedling size. Fire takes its toll of small, weak, or diseased seedlings. Longleaf pine can be damaged by ice storms but is less susceptible to ice damage than slash pine (19). The southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) does not seem to afflict the species severely. The black turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus terebrans) can be a problem, especially on trees injured by turpentining, logging, or fire. Perhaps the greatest single cause of mortality in longleaf stands of pole and sawlog size is lightning, which is often followed by infestation by bark beetles (Ips spp.). Windthrow from hurricanes or tornados can cause heavy losses locally. Long term observations throughout the longleaf region have shown an average annual mortality of 1 tree per hectare (0.4/acre) in mature longleaf pine stands (4).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,14,1
"Longleaf pine is native to a wide variety of sites ranging from wet, poorly drained flatwoods to dry, rocky mountain ridges. Elevations range from barely above sea level near the beaches on the lower Coastal Plain up to about 600 m (1,970 ft) in the mountains of Alabama. Most of the longleaf pine forests are found on the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains at elevations below 200 m (660 ft). Here the soils are largely derived from marine sediments and range from deep, coarse, excessively drained sands to poorly drained clays. For the most part, surface soils are sandy, acid, low in organic matter, and relatively infertile. In the Mountain Province, soils are derived largely from granite, quartzite, schist, phyllite, and slate, while in the Ridge and Valley Province, soils are derived mostly from sandstone, shale, limestone, and dolomite (21). Within the natural range of longleaf pine, three soil orders are of major importance. Ultisols are the dominant order and cover most of the southeastern United States outside of peninsular Florida. Ultisols most commonly associated with longleaf pine are the Typic Paleudults and Plinthic Paleudults. The other two soil orders are Entisols and Spodosols. Deep, sandy Entisols, primarily Quartzipsamments, range from about 3 m (10 ft) above sea level in Florida up to about 185 m (600 ft) in Georgia and the Carolinas. Entisols have not developed diagnostic horizons. They make up the Sandhills of the Carolinas, Georgia, and northwest Florida and the sand ridges in the central Highlands of peninsular Florida. Spodosols, particularly Aquods, are typical of the flatwoods of the lower Coastal Plain in Florida. They are wet, sandy soils with a fluctuating water table that is at or near the surface during rainy seasons (8).",Soils and Topography,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,15,1
"Longleaf pine is used for a broad range of forest products. Even old lightered stumps (those having resin-soaked heartwood characteristic of old trees) are pulled out and the stumpwood destructively distilled for chemicals. Longleaf ""pine straw"" is in demand for use as a mulch, so fresh needle litter is sometimes collected, baled, and sold. The longleaf pine forest, if regularly burned, has a parklike appearance with an understory dominated by grasses and forbs; an excellent habitat for game, especially quail, and quail hunting has long been associated with this timber type. The understory produces a substantial amount of high quality forage for both cattle and deer (17,31). Mature longleaf stands also provide the most desirable habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker.",Special Uses,Longleaf Pine,pinus,palustris,conifer,16,1
"There is ample debate over the nomenclature of maría. Calophyllum brasiliense var. antillanum (Britton) Standl. was considered a variety of C. brasiliense Camb. (15). The former was also considered synonymous with C. calaba Jacq., but not L., as well as with C. antillanum Britton and C. jacquinii Fawc. & Rendle (15). Later, however,C. brasiliense Camb. was replaced by C. calaba L. The ""variety"" antillanum is found in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and ranges from Cuba to Jamaica through the Lesser Antilles to Granada. A closely related species, Calophyllum lucidum Benth., or a variety known as galba, grows in Trinidad, Tobago, and British Guiana (15). The timbers are similar in appearance and technical properties and they are marketed under a single trade name (18). Much work needs to be done on the Guttiferae family and the genus Calophyllum. Because the range of this species is extensive, approximately from latitude 23' N. to 20° S., it is likely that other varieties remain to be described, and further changes in nomenclature may be expected.",Genetics,"Mar&iacute;a, Santa-Mar&iacute;a",calophyllum,calaba,hardwood,7,0
"María is native to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and widely distributed through the West Indies. It ranges from Mexico through the Guianas to Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. It is naturalized in Bermuda and has been introduced in southern Florida (15). In Puerto Rico, it is native to the moist coastal and limestone regions, probably ranging through 150 in (492 ft) in elevation. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, marfa is found near the coast at low elevations on moist through wet sites, and occasionally in areas that are inundated during part of the year (16,18,30,31). In northern South America, it is found along river banks and in stream valleys (25). The tree, when established, is capable of growing on degraded soils. In Puerto Rico, maría is found naturally in the Subtropical Moist Forest life zone. Annual rainfall varies from about 1500 to 2000 mm (59 to 79 in), with annual evapotranspiration ranging from 1500 to 1780 mm (59 to 70 in). Mean annual temperature is 25° C (77° F) with little variation during the year (7). Plantations, however, have been established in wetter and drier sites including the Subtropical Dry Forest life zone with annual rainfall of only 1000 mm (39 in). Plantation sites in the Cordillera Central and the Luquillo Mountains have annual rainfall as high as 3050 mm (120 in). In Nicaragua, maria occurs in Lowland Rain Forest and Lower Montane Rain Forest (5) with annual rainfall ranging from 1980 to 5000 mm (78 to 197 in) (31). In British Honduras (19) and elsewhere in the Caribbean, annual rainfall varies from about 1500 to 2500 mm (59 to 98 in). None of these areas has temperatures below freezing. María is native to the sandy soils on the north coast of Puerto Rico where it grows mainly on soils of the orders Inceptisols, Oxisols, and Alfisols. It is also found on coastal sands in the central Lesser Antilles (4). In Puerto Rico, it has been planted in the interior mountains on deep clays and serpentine soils, and on shallow limestone soils at lower elevations near the coast (22). In general, it tolerates degraded sites and a variety of drainage conditions. It may be found on ridges, slopes, coves, flats, and swamps. In Puerto Rico, maria is not planted on good sites because faster growing species are preferred. It is recommended, however, where erosion has depleted soil fertility, for straight slopes, ridges, and convex slopes (22). In British Guiana and Surinam it grows in freshwater swamps; and in Jamaica it is found on volcanic and metamorphic shales (2,25). In Puerto Rico, maría is associated with ucar (Bucida buceras), roble blanco (Tabebuia heterophyl1a), algarrobo (Hymenaea courbaril), palo de pollo (Pterocarpus officinalis), and palma real (Roystonea borinquena), all in the Subtropical Moist Forest. Elsewhere within its range, marfa is a constituent of several different forest types (table 1) and is found in association with numerous species. In particular, the tree is found in moist to wet primary forest at low elevations, and in secondary forest. In Central America, it is often found in association with caoba hondureña (Swietenia macrophylla) and cedro hembra (Cedrela odorata) (18). In British Honduras, it is found in successional forests along with the genera Orbignya, Dialium, Virola, Termmalia, Symphonia, and Vochysia (30). In the Lesser Antilles, it is associated with almácigo (Bursera simaruba), malagueta (Pimenta racemosa), laurel avispillo (Nectandra coriacea), and cupey (Clusia rosea) (4). ¹Holdridge (12,13)-Puerto Rico, British Honduras, Costa Rica, and Venezuala; Beard (2,5)-Nicaragua Jamaica, Cuba, St. Kitts, Dominica, and Martinique; Lindeman (16)-Surinam. ²Not Available",Habitat,"Mar&iacute;a, Santa-Mar&iacute;a",calophyllum,calaba,hardwood,8,0
"The mature maría tree is easily identified by a combination of characteristics including its opposite, elliptical, dark-green leaves with numerous parallel, lateral veins and very dense foliage. A yellowish sap exudes from broken leaves, twigs, and incisions in the trunk. The bark has many diamond-shaped fissures. In Puerto Rico, the tree commonly attains a height of 12 to 20 m (39 to 67 ft) and about 45 cm (18 in) in diameter. Where conditions are favorable elsewhere in its range, it sometimes attains a height of 30 to 45 m (100 to 150 ft) and is supported by a straight, unbuttressed bole 90 to 215 cm (35 to 85 in) in diameter. At maturity, maría is a canopy tree with a dense, rounded crown. Flowering and Fruiting- María is polygamous; male and bisexual flowers are borne in 5-cm (2-in) racemes on the same tree. The bisexual flowers have four white, rounded, and concave sepals about 0.65 cm (0.25 in) long; the smaller white sepals are commonly absent. Male flowers have about 40 to 50 stamens in a prominent orange cluster more than 6 mm (0.25 in) across, and often a rudimentary pistil. In Puerto Rico, flowering is chiefly in the spring and summer, and the fruit matures in the fall (15). In Trinidad the normal flowering period is in September and October, but trees flower at other times. The fruits, which are globose, one-seeded drupes, about 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter, usually ripen the following May or June. Some trees have been observed to flower and fruit when only 3 years old. Good seed years were found to be irregular in Trinidad (23) although the tree fruits abundantly on an annual basis in Puerto Rico. Seed Production and Dissemination- A substantial portion of the seeds fall below the parent tree where they germinate and form dense stands of seedlings. On steep slopes, however, some are removed by heavy rains. Seeds maintain their viability well, and a fair germination rate is attained even with seeds that have been stored for 1 year in a dry room. Average germination in Puerto Rico is about 70 percent. Use of fresh seeds is desirable in the establishment of plantations. Usually seeds are sown directly into the soil and demonstrate a favorable germination capacity except when the seeds are empty. In Trinidad, the agouti (a tropical rodent) sometimes carries off the fruits and stores them in caches; bats also aid in dispersal (23). In Puerto Rico, birds, bats, and rats are dispersal agents (21). Seedling Development- During the storage of fruits, the water content should not be lower than 35 percent nor the storage temperature below 0° C (32° F) (37). germination is hypogeous and occurs within 6 weeks, provided the seeds are sown without an endocarp. Untreated fruits give the same results after 16 weeks. Retarded germination is caused by the endocarp, which inhibits water uptake. The endocarp may be broken by striking with a hammer. Broadcasting of seeds in suitable conditions results in germination. Plantations, however, are usually established by planting seeds in the ground at a depth of 2.5 cm (1 in) using a dibble. Direct sowing of maría fruits has been done under the light shade of pino australiano (Casuarina equisetifolia), in areas where farmers wanted to perpetuate windbreaks. The seedlings demonstrated nearly 100 percent survival with a height growth of 1.2 in (4 ft) in only 2 years. María has also been seeded within rows of beans that provide shade and protect the seedlings from desiccation (23). In the mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico, where annual rainfall is more than 2500 mm (98 in), fruits were placed in raised piles of earth where they germinated and grew successfully (11). The first leaves are produced when the seedling is about 10 cm (4 in) tall. When the seedling reaches about 15 cm (6 in), as determined by the reserve food supply in the seed, it often ceases to grow in height while the root system establishes itself Seeds sown in nursery beds produce plants with a maximum height of 1 m (3 ft) in 1 year. Several experiments have been conducted with maría seedlings by personnel of, the Institute of Tropical Forestry. Seeds pregerminated in wet moss and later planted with radicles or hypocotyls 8 cm (3 in) or under were less successful than dibbled fruits without pretreatment. Bareroot plantings cut to about 10 cm. (4 in) in height, in exposed conditions, failed nearly 100 percent because of desiccation. The results were the same in heavy shade. In exposed conditions, transplanting of maría. has only been successful when the plants were moved with a ball of earth. Best results are achieved when the transplants are moved during the rainy season. Vegetative Reproduction- maría does not coppice, except when very young, nor does it produce root suckers. Similarly, neither root nor shoot cuttings have been proved successful as a means of establishment. Growth and Yield- Growth of maría at all stages in the life cycle appears to be slow in Puerto Rico. The tree does not reach its maximum size on the island, and most of the growth records are for poor sites. ¹Height and diameter values derived from dominant and codominat trees only. Volume determined outside bark to an upper stem diameter of 10 cm (3.9 in). Biomass=VolumeX0.51 (specific gravity of María) estimate is high because no correction is made for bark thickness. ²Not Available Plantations in Trinidad and Puerto Rico vary from 22 to 34 years old and show that volume mean annual increment (MAI) ranges from 4.3 to 12.6 m³/ha (61 to 180 ft³/acre) (table 2). Height MAI varies from 0.6 to 1.4 m (2.0 to 4.6 ft) and diameter MAI from 5.6 to 13.8 mm (0.22 to 0.54 in). Crude estimates of biomass MAI range between 2.2 and 6.4 metric t/ha (0.98 and 2.86 tons/acre). Additional measurements elsewhere in Puerto Rico confirm these diameter and height growth rates (table 3). ¹Not available. Rooting Habit- María is a deep-rooted species, at least when young. The seedling produces a definite tap root with a quantity of short side roots at regular intervals. Even on the exposed limestone hills where the soil is too shallow for planting seedlings, roots of maría, once established, penetrate to considerable depths. Planting in shallow soil pockets on lower slopes and bottom lands has given excellent results. Reaction to Competition- María is intolerant of intense shade in the seedling phase. Seeds below the dense cover of the parent tree may germinate but often become encrusted with mosses and lichens. In contrast, seedlings in full sunlight may suffer from sun scorching in the dry season. Light shade in the first couple of years appears to yield the best growth. After successful establishment, however, full sunlight is needed for most rapid development. Overall, maría is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. In areas subject to drought, weedings may not be needed. In humid areas, circular weeding 1 m (3 ft) around the seedlings should be done at least once a year for 3 years. In an experiment conducted by Institute of Tropical Forestry personnel with seedlings planted in Panicum spp. and Ipomoea spp. undergrowth, the weeded seedlings had 50 percent survival with an average height of 2.3 m (8 ft), but the unweeded trees showed only 12 percent survival and growth to 1.2 m (4 ft). maría has a sturdy stem and its greatest attribute is its ability to dominate grass, ferns, or vines when planted on adverse sites (21). Usually close spacings of 1.8 by 1.8 m (6 by 6 ft) or 1.5 by 1.5 in (5 by 5 ft) are used to accelerate crown closure and preclude lateral branching (20). Wider spacings yield more rapid diameter increment but create poor tree form. Attempts to improve growth by thinning have been tried in dense, overstocked 18-year-old stands in Puerto Rico (34). The stands were located infertile serpentine soils in the western Cordillera, and had densities ranging from 1,280 to 3,530 stems per hectare (518 to 1,429/acre). The stands were about 10 to 15 m (35 to 50 ft) tall and about 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. Basal areas ranged from 13.3 to 37.9 m²/ha (58 to 165 ft²/acre). The difference in diameter between dominant and suppressed stems was only 2.5 cm (1 in). In the most dense stand, basal area was reduced from 37.9 m²/ha (165 ft²/acre) to 25.7 m² /lia (112 ft² /acre), but no acceleration in diameter growth was observed after 5 years. A heavier thinning was made on adjacent plots, leaving only 18.4 m²/ha (80 ft² /acre). In this instance, 85 percent of the residual trees had crown freedom and overhead light. After 3 years, no detectable acceleration in diameter growth was evident. Crowns were still narrow, and few new branches were formed (33). Damaging Agents- The heartwood is rated as durable to moderately durable with respect to decay resistance but susceptible to marine borers (6,8), the drywood termite (Cryptotermes brevis) in Puerto Rico (18,36), and the subterranean termites (Captotermes brevis, Heterotermes convexinotatus, H. tennis, and Nasutitermes corniger) in Panama (6). When maría was substituted for imported track sleepers in British Honduras, a marked difference was observed between wet and dry sections of the track. In wet sections, fungal attack was prevalent; in the dry section, termite attack was more pronounced (24). A fast-killing wilt that affects all tree sizes in about the same length of time was observed in Central America (9). It is first evidenced by a dry branch in the tree top, followed in 4 weeks by chlorotic foliage, and then death. Internally, dark-brown streaking is observed in the vascular system caused by a gum that plugs the vessels. The causal agent is a species of Cephalosporium. The disease was described as the first epidemic disease in Central America and was compared in its virulence to chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis u1mi), or persimmon wilt (Acremonium diospyri) of the United States (32). In Trinidad, a leaf curl is prevalent on young plants and may be a response to weather conditions. A thread blight fungus (possibly Corticium stevensii) was observed on one estate, and in another area, a few trees were attacked by a root fungus tentatively identified as a species of Rosellinia. Trees of large size in Trinidad are usually sound to the base (23). Also in Trinidad, maría is infected by mycorrhizae that are present throughout the root system but not extremely abundant. Similar mycorrhizae have been found in 85 percent of the species in the Trinidad flora including other forest species (14). In Puerto Rico, an unidentified seed borer was observed in Maricao Forest (11). More common, however, are splotches on leaves and premature defoliation when thrips (Thripidae) infestation is heavy.",Life History,"Mar&iacute;a, Santa-Mar&iacute;a",calophyllum,calaba,hardwood,10,0
"The wood of maría is widely used in the tropics. The heartwood varies from yellowish pink through reddish brown while sapwood is generally lighter in color. The grain is usually interlocked, and the specific gravity ranges from 0.51 to 0.57. The wood is fairly easy to work, rating above average in shaping, sanding, and mortising, and below average in planing, turning, and boring. It is moderately difficult to air-season and shows moderate to severe warp. The sapwood is easily impregnated with preservatives by either pressure or open-tank-bath methods, but the heartwood is extremely resistant to impregnation (8,17,18). María wood is suitable for general construction, flooring, bridge construction, furniture, boat construction, cabinetmaking, shingles, interior construction, agricultural implements, poles, crossties, and handles (15,25). It is a good general utility wood where a fairly strong and moderately durable timber is required. In British Honduras, it was substituted for imported creosoted sleepers but required replacement after 3 or 4 years (24). In Mexico, attempts to use the timber in the veneer and plywood industry were not entirely successful (26). The tree is also planted for shade along streets and as a windbreak or to protect against salt spray near the ocean. Frequently it is pruned to form a dense hedge along property lines in urban areas (28). The latex from the trunk has been employed medicinally. The fruits are used as hog-feed, and lamp oil is extracted from the seeds (15,25). The tree's adaptability to a variety of sites in Puerto Rico has made it popular among soil scientists and foresters for rehabilitation of degraded lands.",Special Uses,"Mar&iacute;a, Santa-Mar&iacute;a",calophyllum,calaba,hardwood,16,0
"Most natural vegetation of southern Florida can be invaded to some extent by melaleuca (8, p. 9-15). It is often found growing in the cover type Pondcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 100) and in South Florida Slash Pine (Type 111); to a lesser extent it can be found in Baldcypress (Type 101) (6). The ecotone between slash pine and either cypress variety is readily invaded. Melaleuca also exists in some locations with the naturalized species Brazil peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia) and Australian pine (Casuarina spp.). It is even found with button-mangrove (Conocarpus erectus) just inland of the tidal zone of Mangrove (Type 106). However, melaleuca invasion is less prominent on forested sites than on marshes and wet savannas. Most shrub, herb, and graminoid species in southern Florida are likely to be found in association with melaleuca. Common associates are saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens), three-awn wiregrass (Aristida stricta), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), and sawfern (Blechnum serrulatum). In Hawaii, natural regeneration occurs only at the edges of plantations, on road cuts, and in swampy, sparsely vegetated spots in forests (20). It is one of the few trees that survive planting and reproduce naturally on upland bogs that form when native forests are destroyed.",Associated Forest Cover,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,1,0
"Southern Florida's climate is transitional between tropical wet-and-dry and subtropical humid and is similar to the climate of melaleuca's native habitat in Australia (21). The rainy season normally begins in June and ends in September in Florida. Occasional sudden freezing temperatures, which can be expected from late November to early March (15), and dry-season rainfall, both of which result from the passing of continental cold fronts, distinguish southern Florida's climate from tropical wet-and-dry. In Hawaii, rainfall is evenly distributed or has a winter maximum. Good growth of melaleuca occurs at mean annual temperatures from 24° to 18° C (75° to 65° F), but trees grow in even cooler temperatures at high elevations (20). Trees grow well in rainfall of 1020 min (40 in) at lower elevations (20), and 5080 mm (200 in) at higher elevations.",Climate,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,2,0
"Melaleuca was initially introduced into Florida as seeds and probably originated from only a few trees in New South Wales, Australia (14). Records for these initial and possibly subsequent introductions are inadequate for determining provenance. Racial differences have not been observed in Florida. In Hawaii, at least eight other melaleuca species are present on a minor scale (20). Melaleuca quinquenervia for many years was lumped with nine other species under the name M. leucadendron (L.) L., confusing the literature considerably (2).",Genetics,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,7,0
"Melaleuca's native range is along the coast of eastern Australia from Sydney northward. It is native also in New Caledonia, Papua, New Guinea, and Irian Jaya. Melaleuca grows in swampy ground and on creek banks, and even on hillsides if ground water remains close to the surface. In its native habitat, melaleuca grows to 25 m (82 ft) tall and is typically found in almost pure stands or with a few associates, such as Casuarina glauca, Eucalyptus robusta, and E. tereticornis (2,3,10,22). In melaleuca's Australian habitat, soils are nutrient deficient and flooded or wet for most of the year; summer rainfall dominates; light frost (-l° to -3° C; 30° to 27° F) occurs in most years in the south; spring is associated with brief to acute water stress; and fire and water-table fluctuations are major factors governing plant distribution (3,4,22). These conditions are similar to those of southern Florida (24) and help explain melaleuca's aggressive spread there. In the continental United States, melaleuca is naturalized on a significant scale only in southern Florida. In Hawaii (20), a million trees have been planted in Hawaii State Forest Reserves alone, but natural regeneration is very localized. Planted melaleuca is common in southern California and is occasionally found in extreme southern Texas; it is uncommon in Puerto Rico (13). Melaleuca was introduced to southern Florida in the early 1900's (14). By 1980 it dominated the stands in which it grew, or, where no other trees existed, it had a minimum stocking of 17 percent on 16 000 ha (40,000 acres) (8, p. 1-8). Scattered individuals and clusters of melaleuca trees grow on an additional 170 000 ha (420,000 acres) from the northern edge of Lake Okeechobee southward. Rare and isolated small pockets of natural regeneration are found in central Florida. Much of the melaleuca is in and around urban areas and it is grown as an ornamental as far north as Gainesville.",Native Range,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- In Florida, flowering typically begins by age 3 and seedlings less than I m (3 ft) tall may bloom (14). Showy flowers are borne in creamy-white ""bottlebrush"" spikes 3 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in) long. Flowering occurs in every month except February, March, and April. After flowering, twigs continue to elongate from the ends of spikes to produce leaves or more flowers. Individual trees bloom from two to five times a year, but pronounced, regionwide flowering occurs at least twice a year. Soil type may influence time of flowering, and heavy rainfall may trigger flowering. In Hawaii, melaleuca flowers throughout the year (20). The species is monoecious, flowers are complete, and pollination is by insects. Seed Production and Dissemination- Melaleuca's reproductive potential is prodigious (14,25). On average, 30 sessile seed capsules are left by one flower spike; a branch may bear 8 to 12 of these seed-bearing sections, often alternating with foliage, along a single axis. The capsules are hard, woody, squat, cylindrical, and brown and are aggregated in tightly packed files around the branches. A tree can hold seeds for more than 10 years. The seeds are tiny (30,000/g or 850,000/oz); a single capsule contains 200 to 350 seeds. Seeds are not released at maturity, but fire, frost, wind breakage, natural pruning, or damage by people interrupts the capsules' vascular connections, causing them to dehisce. While large numbers of seeds are typically released after injury, seedfall may occur year round. Ninety-nine percent of the seeds fall within a radius 15 times the height of the seed tree (8, p. 17-21). Fallen seeds can be spread by flowing water. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Dense reproduction occurs when fire prepares a seedbed and causes trees to shed millions of seeds. Seedlings averaging 2 m (6.5 ft) tall may be as dense as 3.5 million per ha (1.4 million/acre). If seedlings are submerged by water for several months, they may survive and resume growth. Seedling height growth may occur every month of the year, but growth is most rapid in spring to early summer and late summer to early fall. Natural seedlings rarely grow more than 1 m (3 ft) tall during the first year. However, seedlings planted at a density of 10,000 per ha (4,050/acre) grew 2 m (6.5 ft) in 6 months on drained muck soil (5,7,8, p. 23-28, 14,17). Vegetative Reproduction- Melaleuca stumps readily sprout, and felled tops can root under very moist conditions. Root suckering is rare but can be profuse when it occurs (1,14).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The difficulty in determining ages of melaleuca trees has limited growth analyses (7,8, p. 23-28). A representative sapling stand may have 34,500 saplings per hectare (14,000/acre), and some areas have up to 158,000 per ha (64,000/acre). In Florida swamps, melaleuca stands that appear mature (fig. 1) may have 7,000 to 20,000 melaleuca stems per hectare (2,900 to 8,100/acre), outside bark basal area up to 133 m²/ha (580 ft²/acre), and a volume outside bark of 770 m³ /ha (11,000 ft³/acre). Average heights in these stands range from 15 to 21 m (49 to 69 ft). Maximum height is 30 m (98 ft). Stands on shallow or better drained soils contain substantially less volume than the swamp stands, although the density of stems may be equally high. Trees in Hawaiian plantations (20) at age 40 on good sites average 50 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. and 18 in (60 ft) tall at a spacing of 6 by 6 in (20 by 20 ft). The largest trees there reach 90 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. and 24 in (80 ft) in height. Rooting Habit- The root system of melaleuca is adapted to fluctuating water tables. The surface root network is complemented by abundant vertical sinker roots that extend at least to the water table's deepest annual level. During periods of surface flooding, ""water roots"" proliferate from permanent surface roots and submerged portions of the stem (14). Reaction to Competition- Melaleuca rarely has to compete directly with other tree species in Florida because it mainly invades sparsely vegetated ecotones, prairies, marshes, and fire-damaged forests. It is classed as intolerant of shade. Melaleuca's presence in pine and cypress stands can cause an otherwise innocuous fire to become a crown fire that damages melaleuca only superficially but can kill the coniferous competition (8, p. 2935). Massive seed release typically follows, allowing melaleuca to preempt the site and form an almost pure stand. Pure stands with closed canopy strongly inhibit the development of understory vegetation, including advance reproduction of melaleuca seedlings. Landscaping and lowering of water tables have accelerated the spread of melaleuca in Florida and increased the area that can be invaded easily. Melaleuca is a common ornamental in southern and central Florida; seed trees have, thereby, become widely distributed. Drainage and excessive use of ground waters shortens the annual hydroperiod, the effect being a substantial increase in large destructive wildfires (24). A general drying of the environment places most native wetland plants at a disadvantage relative to melaleuca, which successfully combines the tolerance of fire and seasonally low ground water levels with adaptations to seasonal flooding. In Hawaii, fire is not common and sites with impeded drainage do not dominate; therefore, melaleuca has little competitive advantage. Damaging Agents- Melaleuca seems to be unusually free of disease, even in its native habitat (9,22). Although many insects, nematodes, and fungi have been found on melaleuca in Florida, none seriously damages the trees (8, p. 125-128). Severe freezes defoliate and kill branches of mature melaleuca even in extreme southern Florida, but trees generally recover by epicormic sprouting. Even when the cambium is killed to the ground line, sprouts arise from the root collar. Seedling kill from freezes, however, probably limits significant amounts of natural regeneration north of Lake Okeechobee. Melaleuca is rarely killed by fire; fire-damaged trees quickly recover by prolific epicormic sprouting.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,14,0
"Most of southern Florida is less than 8 in (25 ft) above sea level. The land is level to very gently sloping, and a freshwater table is close to the soil surface. In general, soils supporting melaleuca are in the suborders Psammaquents, Aquods, and Saprists (sometimes marly) of the orders Entisol, Spodosol, and Histosol, respectively (23). Many soils are shallow and underlain by limestone. In Hawaii, melaleuca is found from sea level to 1400 in (4,500 ft) elevation (20). It grows fairly well on all Hawaiian soils, including calcareous beach sand, but does best on Inceptisols (Dystrandrepts), Ultisols, and Oxisols developed on basalt ash or lava rock of pH 4.5 to 5.5, and under rainfall of 2030 to 5080 min (80 to 200 in) per year.",Soils and Topography,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,15,0
"In Florida, melaleuca is a common ornamental, but to many, an undesirable one because of its reputation for causing acute respiratory problems. Volatile substances produced by the tree have been implicated (16). Oils in the foliage and bark emit a medicinal fragrance; the nectiferous flowers emit an unpleasant, musty odor. However, clinical studies found neither the tree's vapors nor its pollen to be virulent irritants or allergens (8, p. 101-115). Respiratory problems attributed to melaleuca do not occur in Australia (10) or in Hawaii (20). Melaleuca is not used in Florida or Hawaii for traditional timber products because its bark-to-wood ratio is high, the average stem diameter small, and the form poor. However, the wood is a suitable timber for such uses as pulp and cabinetry; the bark has potential uses as an amendment to plant potting mixes and in packaging and insulation (8, p. 37-68). The entire tree can be used as a biomass fuel but it is more difficult to use than most other species because of its powdery, low-density bark (8, p. 69-78). The leaves contain an essential oil (niaouli oil) that is extracted and sold commercially in New Caledonia (2,19). The virtually identical cajeput oil is derived from Melaleuca cajeputi in Indonesia. In Hawaii the tree was planted to conserve soil on deforested sites, and the tree has had many other uses in its native habitat (18,20,22). The abundant flower crops of this insect-pollinated species are essential to Florida's large apiary industry (8, p. 79-80). However, melaleuca in Florida is viewed by many as an environmental threat that transcends its commercial value. Native vegetation is displaced and pure stands have dubious value to wildlife (8, p. 81-89, 91-98). Its consumption of ground water is suspected to substantially exceed that of native vegetation (8, p. 117-123). Buildings in melaleuca stands are exposed to a serious fire hazard (8, p. 29-35).",Special Uses,Melaleuca,melaleuca,quinquenervia,hardwood,16,0
"There is no published information concerning population or other genetic studies of this species. Hickories are noted for their variability, and many natural hybrids are known among North American species. Hickories usually can be intercrossed successfully within the genus (14). Geneticists recognize that mockernut hickory hybridizes naturally with: C. illinoensis (Carya x schneckii Sarg.) and C. ovata (Carya x collina Laughlin).",Genetics,Mockernut Hickory,carya,tomentosa,hardwood,7,0
"Mockernut hickory, a true hickory, grows from Massachusetts and New York west to southern Ontario, southern Michigan, and northern Illinois; then to southeastern Iowa, Missouri, and eastern Kansas, south to eastern Texas and east to northern Florida. This species is not present in New Hampshire and Vermont as previously mapped by Little (20). Mockernut hickory is most abundant southward through Virginia, North Carolina and Florida where it is the most common of the hickories. It is also abundant in the lower Mississippi Valley and grows largest in the lower Ohio River Basin and in Missouri and Arkansas (24,26). -The native range of mockernut hickory. The climate where mockernut hickory grows is usually humid. Within its range the mean annual precipitation measures from 890 mm (35 in) in the north to 2030 mm (80 in) in the south. During the growing season (April through September), annual precipitation varies from 510 to 890 mm (20 to 35 in). About 200 cm (80 in) of annual snowfall is common in the northern part of the range, but it seldom snows in the southern portion. Annual temperatures range from 10° to 21° C (50° to 70° F). Temperatures range from 21° to 27' C (70° to 80° F) in July and from -7° to 16° C (20° to 60° F) in January. Temperature extremes are well above 38° C (100° F) and below -18° C (0° F). The growing season is approximately 160 days ?h the northern part of the range and up to 320 days in the southern part of the range (33,37). In the north, mockernut hickory is found on drier soils of ridges and hillsides and less frequently on moist woodlands and alluvial bottoms (26). The species grows and develops best on deep, fertile soils (11,24). In the Cumberland Mountains and hills of southern Indiana, it grows on dry sites such as south and west slopes or dry ridges. Mockernut grows in Alabama and Mississippi on sandy soils with shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and loblolly pine (P taeda). However, most of the merchantable mockernut grows on moderately fertile upland soils (26). Mockernut hickory grows primarily on Ultisols occurring on an estimated 65 percent of its range, including much of the southern to northeastern United States (36). These soils are low in nutrients and usually moist, but during the warm season, they are dry part of the time. Along the mid-Atlantic and in the southern and western range, mockernut hickory grows on a variety of soils on slopes of 25 percent or less, including combinations of fine to coarse loams, clays, and well-drained quartz sands. On slopes steeper than 25 percent, mockernut often grows on coarse loams. Mockernut grows on Inceptisols in an estimated 15 percent of its range. These clayey soils are moderate to high in nutrients and are primarily in the Appalachians on gentle to moderate slopes where water is available to plants during the growing season. In the northern Appalachians on slopes of 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory grows on poorly drained loams with a fragipan. In the central and southern Appalachians on slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory grows on fine loams. On steeper slopes it grows on coarse loams (36). In the northwestern part of the range, mockernut grows on Mollisols. These soils have a deep, fertile surface horizon greater than 25 cm (10 in) thick. Mollisols characteristically form under grass in climates with moderate to high seasonal precipitation. Mockernut grows on a variety of soils including wet, fine loams, sandy textured soils that often have been burned, plowed, and pastured. Alfisols are also present in these areas and contain a medium to high supply of nutrients. Water is available to plants more than half the year or more than 3 consecutive months during the growing season. On slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut grows on wet to moist, fine loam soils with a high carbonate content (36). Mockernut hickory is associated with the eastern oak-hickory forest and the beech-maple forest. The species does not exist in sufficient amounts to be included as a title species in the Society of American Foresters forest cover types (9). Nevertheless, it is identified as an associated species in eight cover types. Three of the upland oak types and the bottom land type are subclimax to climax. The types are: Central Forest Region (upland oaks)-Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), White Oak (Type 53), Black Oak (Type 110). Southern Forest Region (southern yellow pines) Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80); (oak-pine type) Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82); (bottom-land type) Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91). In the central forest upland oak types, mockernut is commonly associated with pignut hickory (Carya glabra), shagbark hickory (C. ovata), and bitternut hickory (C.cordiformis); black oak Quercus velutina), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), chestnut oak (Q. muehlenbergii), post oak (Q. stellata), and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa); blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), maples (Acer spp.), white ash (Fraxinus americana), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Common understory vegetation includes flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sumac (Rhus spp.), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), downy serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), redbud (Cercis canadensis), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), and American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana). Mockernut is also associated with wild grapes (Vitis spp.), rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum), mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia), greenbriers (Smilax spp.), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and spicebush (Lindera benzoin). Other understory vegetation includes New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), wild hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens), tick-trefoil (Desmodium spp.), bluestem (Andropogon spp.), poverty oatgrass (Danthonia spicata), sedges (Carex spp.), pussytoes (Antennaria spp.), goldenrod (Solidago spp.), and asters (Aster spp.). In the southern forest, mockernut grows with shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, pignut hickory, gums, several oaks, sourwood, and winged elm (Ulmus alata). Other common understory vegetation includes flowering dogwood, redbud, sourwood, persimmon (Diospyros uirginiana), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), sumacs, hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), blueberries, honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), mountain-laurel, viburnums, greenbriers, and grapes. In the Loblolly Pine-Hardwood Type in the southern forest, mockernut commonly grows in the upland and drier sites with white oak (Quercus alba), post oak, northern red oak (Q. rubra), southern red oak (Q. falcata), and scarlet oak; shagbark and pignut hickories; and blackgum. Understory vegetation includes flowering dogwood, hawthorn, sourwood, greenbrier, grape, honeysuckle, and blueberry. In the southern bottom lands, mockernut occurs in the Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak Type along with green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash, shagbark, shellbark (Carya laciniosa), and bitternut hickories; white oak, Delta post oak (Quercus stellata var. paludosa), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), and blackgum. Understory trees include pawpaw (Asimina triloba), flowering dogwood, painted buckeye (Aesculus sylvatica), American hombeam, devils-walking stick (Aralia spinosa), redbud, American holly (Ilex opaca), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), and Coastal Plain willow (Salix caroliniana).",Habitat,Mockernut Hickory,carya,tomentosa,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Mockernut hickory is monoecious-male and female flowers are produced on the same tree. Mockernut male flowers are catkins about 10 to 13 cm (4 to 5 in) long and may be produced on branches from axils of leaves of the previous season or from the inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth (4). The female flowers appear in short spikes on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers bloom in the spring from April to May, depending on latitude and weather. Usually the male flowers emerge before the female flowers. Hickories produce very large amounts of pollen that is dispersed by the wind. Fruits are solitary or paired and globose, ripening in September and October, and are about 2.5 to 9.0 cm (1.0 to 3.5 in) long with a short necklike base. The fruit has a thick, four-ribbed husk 3 to 4 mm (0.11 to 0.16 in) thick that usually splits from the middle to the base. The nut is distinctly four-angled with a reddish-brown, very hard shell 5 to 6 mm (0.20 to 0.23 in) thick containing a small edible kernel (4,10,19,22). Seed Production and Dissemination- The seed is dispersed from September through December. Mockernut hickory requires a minimum of 25 years to reach commercial seed-bearing age. Optimum seed production occurs from 40 to 125 years, and the maximum age listed for commercial seed production is 200 years (4). Good seed crops occur every 2 to 3 years with light seed crops in intervening years. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of fresh seed will germinate (26). Fourteen mockernut hickory trees in southeastern Ohio produced an average annual crop of 6,285 nuts for 6 years; about 39 percent were sound, 48 percent aborted, and 13 percent had insect damage (28). Hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) is probably a major factor in reducing germination. Mockernut hickory produces one of the heaviest seeds of the hickory species; cleaned seeds range from 70 to 250 seeds/kg (32 to 113/lb). Seed is disseminated mainly by gravity and wildlife, particularly squirrels. Birds also help disperse seed. Wildlife such as squirrels and chipmunks often bury the seed at some distance from the seed-bearing tree. Seedling Development- Hickory seeds show embryo dormancy that can be overcome by stratification in a moist medium at 1° to 4° C (33° to 40° F) for 30 to 150 days. When stored for a year or more, seed may require stratification for only 30 to 60 days. Hickory nuts seldom remain viable in the ground for more than I year. Hickory species normally require a moderately moist seedbed for satisfactory seed germination, and mockernut hickory seems to reproduce best in moist duff. Germination is hypogeal. Mockernut seedlings are not fast growing. The height growth of mockernut seedlings observed in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade on red clay soil was as follows (24,26): Vegetative Reproduction- True hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after cutting and fire. As the stumps increase in size, the number of stumps that produce sprouts decreases (27); age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden (18) discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed (30) indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (Carya aquatica). However, mockernut root stock grew slowly and reduced the growth of pecan tops. Also, this graft seldom produced a tree that bore well or yielded large nuts. Growth and Yield- Mockernut hickory is a large, true hickory with a dense crown. This species occasionally grows to about 30 m (100 ft) tall and 91 cm (36 in) in d.b.h., but heights and diameters usually range from about 15 to 24 in (50 to 80 ft) and 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in), respectively. The relation of height to age is as follows (26): The current annual growth of mockernut hickory on dry sites is estimated at about 1.0 m³/ha (15 ft³/acre). In fully stocked stands on moderately fertile soil2.1 m³ /ha (30 ft³ /acre) is estimated, though annual growth rates of 3.1 m³/ha (44 ft³/acre) were reported in Ohio (26). Greenwood and bark weights for commercial-size mockernut trees from mixed hardwoods in Georgia are available for total tree and saw-log stems to a 4-inch top for trees 5 to 22 inches d.b.h. (6). Available growth data and other research information is summarized for hickory species, not for individual species. Trimble (32) compared growth rates of various Appalachian hardwoods including a hickory species category Dominant-codominant hickory trees 38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 in) in d.b.h. on good oak sites grew slowly compared to northern red oak, yellow-poplar, black cherry (Prunus serotina), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Hickories were in the white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) growth-rate category. Dominant-codominant hickory trees grew about 3 mm (0.12 in) d.b.h. per year compared to 5 mm (0.20 in) for the moderate-growth species (black cherry) and 6 mm (0.23 in) for the faster growing species (yellow-poplar and red oak). Equations are available for predicting merchantable gross volumes from hickory stump diameters in Ohio (12). Also, procedures are described for predicting diameters and heights and for developing volume tables to any merchantable top diameter for hickory species in southern Illinois and West Virginia (23,39). Generally, epicormic branching is not a problem with hickory species, but a few branches do occur (31,32). Rooting Habit- True hickories such as mockernut develop a long taproot with few laterals. The species is windfirm. Early root growth is primarily into the taproot, which typically reaches a depth of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) during the first year. Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of 122 cm (48 in), and the laterals grow rapidly. After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the crown. By age 10, the height is 4 times the depth of the taproot (35). Reaction to Competition- At certain times during its life, mockernut hickory may be variously classified as tolerant to intolerant (1,32). Overall it is classified as intolerant of shade. It recovers rapidly from suppression and is probably a climax species on moist sites (26). Silvicultural practices for managing the oak-hickory type have been summarized (38). Establishing the seedling origin of hickory trees is difficult because of seed predators. Although infrequent bumper seed crops usually provide some seedlings, seedling survival is poor under a dense canopy. Because of prolific sprouting ability, hickory reproduction can survive browsing, breakage, drought, and fire. Top dieback and resprouting may occur several times, each successive shoot reaching a larger size and developing a stronger root system than its predecessors (15). By this process, hickory reproduction gradually accumulates and grows under moderately dense canopies, especially on sites dry enough to restrict reproduction of more tolerant but more fire or drought sensitive species. Wherever adequate hickory advance reproduction occurs, clearcutting results in new sapling stands containing some hickories. It is difficult to attain reproduction if advance hickory regeneration is inadequate, however; then clearcutting will eliminate hickories except for stump sprouts. In theory, light thinnings or shelterwood cuts can be used to create advance hickory regeneration, but this has not been demonstrated. Damaging Agents- Mockernut hickory is extremely sensitive to fire because of the low insulating capacity of the hard, flinty bark (13,25). Mockernut is not subject to severe loss from disease. The main fungus of hickory is Poria spiculosa, a trunk rot. This fungus kills the bark, which produces a canker, causes heart rot and decay, and can seriously degrade the tree (13). Mineral streaks and sapsucker-induced streaks also degrade the lumber. In general, the hard, strong, and durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi. Most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small, young trees (3,5). Common foliage diseases include leaf mildew and witches' broom (Microstroma juglandis), leaf blotch (Mycosphaerella dendroides), and pecan scab (Cladosporium effusum). Mockernut hickory is host to anthracnose (Gnomonia caryae). Nuts of all hickory species are susceptible to attack by the hickory nut weevil (Curculio caryae). Another weevil (Conotrachelus aratus) attacks young shoots and leaf petioles. The Curculio species are the most damaging and can destroy 65 percent of the hickory nut crop. Hickory shuckworms also damage nuts (2). The bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) attacks mockernut hickory, especially in drought years and where hickory species are growing rapidly. The hickory spiral borer (Argilus arcuatus torquatus) and the pecan carpenterworm (Cossula magnifica) are also serious insect enemies of mockernut. The hickory bark beetle probably destroys more sawtimber-size mockernut trees than any other insect. The hickory spiral borer kills many seedlings and young trees, and the pecan carpenterworm degrades both trees and logs (26). The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) attacks both small and large trees; it seriously deforms trees by sawing branches. Sometimes these girdlers cut hickory seedlings near ground level. Two casebearers (Acrobasis caryivorella and A. juglandis) feed on buds and leaves; later they bore into succulent hickory shoots. Larvae of A. caryivorella may destroy entire nut sets. The living-hickory borer (Goes pulcher) feeds on hickory boles and branches throughout the East. Borers commonly found on dying or dead hickory trees or cut logs include the banded hickory borer (Knulliana cincta) a long-horned beetle (Saperda discoidea), the apple twig borer (Amphicerus bicaudatus), the flatheaded ambrosia beetle (Platypus compositus), the redheaded ash borer (Neoclytus acuminatus), and the false powderpost beetle (Scobicia bidentata). Severe damage to hickory lumber and manufactured hickory products is caused by powderpost beetles (Lyctus spp. and Polycanon stoutii). Gall insects (Caryomyia spp.) commonly infest leaves. The fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospila) and the hickory leafroller (Argyrotaenia juglandana) are the most common leaf feeders. The giant bark aphid (Longistigma caryae) is common on hickory bark. This aphid usually feeds on twigs and can cause branch mortality. The European fruit lecanium (Parthnolecanium corni) is common on hickories (2). Mockernut is not easily injured by ice glaze or snow, but young seedlings are very susceptible to frost damage. Many birds and animals feed on the nuts of mockernut hickory. This feeding combined with insect and disease problems eliminates the annual nut production, except during bumper seed crop years.",Life History,Mockernut Hickory,carya,tomentosa,hardwood,10,0
"Mockernuts are preferred mast for wildlife, particularly squirrels, which eat green nuts. Black bears, foxes, rabbits, beavers, and white-footed mice feed on the nuts, and sometimes the bark. The white-tailed deer browse on foliage and twigs and also feed on nuts. Hickory nuts are a minor source of food for ducks, quail, and turkey (7,21). True hickories provide a very large portion of the high-grade hickory used by industry (8). Mockernut is used for lumber, pulpwood, charcoal, and other fuelwood products. Hickory species are preferred species for fuelwood consumption. Mockernut has the second highest heating value among the species of hickories (29). It can be used for veneer, but the low supply of logs of veneer quality is a limiting factor (17). Mockernut hickory is used for tool handles requiring high shock resistance. It is used for ladder rungs, athletic goods, agricultural implements, dowels, gymnasium apparatus, poles, shafts, well pumps, and furniture. Lower grade lumber is used for pallets, blocking, and so on (34). Hickory sawdust, chips, and some solid wood are often used by packing companies to smoke meats, and mockernut is the preferred wood for smoking hams (16). Though mockernut kernels are edible, because of their size they are rarely eaten by humans.",Special Uses,Mockernut Hickory,carya,tomentosa,hardwood,16,0
"Monkey-pod is frequently found on old home sites near streams in the forests of Hawaii where it is usually associated with mango (Mangifera indica), ti (Cordyline terminalis), guava (Psidium guajava), another escaped domestic plants. Where naturalized, is associated primarily with grasses, although occasionally with such trees or shrubs as koa-haole (Leucaena leucocephala), Java-plum (Eugenia cumini), and Christmas-berry (Schinus terebinthifolius).",Associated Forest Cover,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,1,0
"Monkey-pod grows in a broad annual rainfall range of 640 to 3810 mm (25 to 150 in). On wet sites (1270 mm [50 in] or more), its growth is often rapid. This rapid growth is at times objectionable because the tree forms a large mat of surface roots and the crown becomes top heavy, thereby overbalancing the tree (5). In Hawaii, the climate in locations where the tree is naturalized and spreading rapidly has winter maximum rainfall ranging from 1140 to 2030 mm (45 to 80 in), with a temperature range of 10° to 30° C (50° to 86° F). These climatic conditions are found between elevations of 15 to 245 in (50 to 800 ft) at several sites on three islands. Elsewhere, the tree is reported to grow at elevations of 0 to 700 in (0 to 2,300 ft) (15). It is, however, very intolerant of frost and also, if grown near the shore, of windblown saltwater spray.",Climate,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,2,0
"No information on the genetics of this tree was found. It is probable that the genetic base at each location where it has been introduced is quite narrow. For example, in Hawaii, the entire population may be the progeny of only two seeds, although the ease with which seed of this species can be transported in one's pocket from the Philippines, for example, makes this unlikely.",Genetics,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,7,0
"Monkey-pod is native from the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, through Guatemala to Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil (3). It grows naturally in latitudes from 5° S. to 11° N. (13). Cultivated throughout the tropics as a shade tree, it has been found in Burma, Ceylon, India, Jamaica, Nigeria, Sabah, Trinidad, Uganda and the island of Zanzibar (12). The species is naturalized in most of these countries as well as in the Philippines and Fiji (7). In the United States and its possessions, monkeypod grows in Hawaii, Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Marianas. It is naturalized in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands (3,10). The tree was reportedly introduced into Hawaii in 1847, when Peter A. Brinsmade, a businessman visiting Europe, returned to Hawaii, presumably via Panama, with two seeds, both of which germinated. One of the seedlings was planted in downtown Honolulu, the other at Koloa on the island of Kauai. These seedlings are possibly the progenitors of all the monkey-pod trees now in Hawaii (1). Monkey-pod may have been introduced into Puerto Rico and Guam as early as the 16th century.",Native Range,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Monkey-pod may flower at any time of the year in Hawaii, but it usually flowers from April to August, with the pea~ of flowering in May The flowers are perfect and form in umbels. The clusters, with their numerous pink stamens, 3.8 cm (1.5 in) long, look like powderpuffs in the tree crown. The flowers are insect pollinated Seed pods develop in from 6 to 8 months and fall to the ground intact, usually between December and April in Hawaii. The dark brown and relatively straight pods are usually 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) long and contain from 5 to 20 seeds (3,8). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are reddish-brown beans about 13 min (0.5 in) long that drop from the pods when they open on the ground. Although the seeds are hard coated and long lived, some germinate soon after moistening by soil contact, resulting in a short period of prolific reproduction even under lawn and garden trees. Most or all of the reproduction dies or is destroyed by insects, rodents, and lawn mowing. Seeds are easily collected by gathering pods on the ground and drying them under cover until they open. Natural dissemination is by birds and rodents. Seeds number from 4,400 to 7,000/kg (2,000 to 3,200/lb) (15). They can be stored dry at 0° to 3° C (32° to 38° F) in closed containers for lengthy periods with little loss of viability. Seeds are normally scarified; they are placed in water at 100° C (212° F), then allowed to cool overnight. Scarified seeds usually germinate 3 to 4 days after sowing. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Seedlings are usually grown from seed planted in containers. In Hawaii, polyethylene bags are now the most commonly used containers for this purpose. Monkey-pod seedlings have also been grown in seed beds and successfully planted bare-root in Hawaii, but not on a large scale. Severe drought stress usually results in high seedling mortality following bareroot planting. Nursery seedlings are of plantable size in about 4 months (15). Seedlings grow rapidly if maintained, reaching 2 to 3 m (6 to 10 ft) within 1 year after planting. Natural seedlings, or planted seedlings that are not weeded, are strongly inhibited by competition and grow much more slowly. Seedlings and mature trees are intolerant of shade (15) and extremely susceptible to damage by overspray of herbicides used in weed control. Vegetative Reproduction- Monkey-pod roots easily Hardwood (leafless) cuttings, ranging in size from 1 by 15 cm (0.4 by 6 in) to stems and branches of mature trees, can be rooted in moist soil on a site without use of mist or shade. In Honolulu, it is common practice to transplant huge trees by cutting away almost all the roots and all the branches. Trees grown at close spacing in the forest frequently have branch-free stems 4 to 5 in (13 to 16 ft) tall and are transplanted to parking lots and parks as ""instant"" full-size shade trees. Despite the ease with which it can be vegetatively propagated, monkey-pod is almost always started from seed.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- One of the best known trees of this species is in Trinidad. When a little more than 100 years old, this tree had a trunk 244 cm (96 in) in diameter, was (reportedly) 44.8 in (147 ft) tall, and had a crown spread of 57 m (187 ft) (3). The large, rounded crown of open-grown trees (fig. 1) provides shade over a wide area. Huge trees such as these are extremely difficult to log, so young, smaller trees are sought after for utilization, particularly those that are forest-grown and have long boles. Although primarily a shade tree, monkey-pod also has potential as a timber tree. After the first year of planting at close spacings in Western Samoa, monkey-pod averaged 4 cm (1.6 in) d.b.h. and 4.4 m (14 ft) tall (2). Because of its large crown, however, it requires wide spacing in plantations. A spacing of 2.4 by 2.4 m (8 by 8 ft) proved much too close in Zanzibar (12). In Hawaii, two plantings at 3 by 3 m (10 by 10 ft) failed, possibly as a result of spacing, but more likely for lack of adequate tending. Monthly weeding around planted trees greatly improved height growth in the Philippines, thus ensuring survival (6). Another planting in Hawaii that covered about 16 ha (40 acres) at 6 by 6 m (20 by 20 ft) was fairly successful and produced many trees with 7 to 10 m (24 to 32 ft), relatively straight, branch-free stems. The growth of this stand, now 85 years old, has never been measured or evaluated, however. Trees in this stand are 18 to 21 m (60 to 70 ft) tall and are about 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in) in diameter, and have crowns that are co-dominant in the overstory with Eucalyptus, Ficus, Persea, and other introduced trees that have invaded over the years. Rate of growth depends on rainfall. In dry areas in Hawaii, diameter growth of open-grown trees is usually less than 13 mm (0.5 in) per year, and total height rarely exceeds 12 m (40 ft). In wet areas, diameter growth usually exceeds 2.5 cm (I in) per year. An annual growth rate of 25 to 35 m³/ha (350 to 500 ft³/acre) was reported, but a source was not cited (15). This rate may be excessive in view of the wide spacing required by this species. Rooting Habit- Depth of rooting varies with amount of rainfall (3,5). In dry areas with less than 1270 mm (50 in) annual rainfall, monkey-pod roots deeply. In wet areas, the root system develops at or near the soil surface and can become a problem in gardens or near paved roads. Reaction to Competition- Monkey-pod is intolerant of shade. The leaves of shaded branches remain folded during the day and contribute little photosynthate. Shaded branches die back and improve the form of trees that shade each other. Damaging Agents- Monkey-pod on the Island of Oahu, HI, is badly defoliated each year by three caterpillars, Melipotis indomita, Ascalapha odorata, and Polydesma umbricola, with most damage attributed to M. indomita (13). The trees promptly leaf out after defoliation, so are not stressed for long. Stressed trees, however, are sometimes attacked by the monkeypod roundheaded borer (Xystrocera globosa), which makes large galleries in the sapwood (11). In Puerto Rico, ants (Myrmelachista ramulorum) bore into branchlets, resulting in defoliation and leaf deformation (14). The defoliators can be controlled with insecticides applied to the tree trunks (13). The tree is highly susceptible to leaf damage from herbicide overspray. Leaves are also very susceptible to damage by salt-laden mist from ocean storms (called 'ehu kai in Hawaiian).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,14,0
"Monkey-pod attains its best growth on deep alluvial soils that are well drained and neutral to slightly acid in reaction. In Hawaii, most areas to which monkey-pod is well adapted are used for cultivated crops. It has naturalized, however, on gently to steeply sloping Oxisols and Inceptisols on certain sites. On these sites it is most common in gullies where the soil is deeper and more moist than on adjacent hills and ridges. It can, however, grow well on a wide variety of soils when planted and can withstand seasonal flooding (15).",Soils and Topography,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,15,0
"The pods contain a sweet edible pulp that supplies nutritious food for animals. Children also chew on the pods, which have a licoricelike flavor (3). Monkey-pod has long been a favorite of plant physiologists for studies of nyctinastic leaf movements (9). Although the tree is commonly used as a shade tree in parking lots, it is undesirable for this purpose because of the sticky flowers, gum, and seed pods that fall from it during much of the year. Monkey-pod wood has been reported as hard and heavy (12), and difficult to work (3,4). Actually, in Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific where it has been used much more extensively than in its native habitat, the wood is considered easy to work, particularly because low shrinkage during drying allows it to be machined while green. Articles made from green wood can be dried without serious drying degrade (10). In Hawaii, monkey-pod has been the premier craftwood used for carved and turned souvenir bowls since 1946. As labor costs increased, however, the industry spread to the Philippines and Thailand, which now supply most of the monkey-pod bowls for which Hawaii is famous.",Special Uses,Monkey-Pod,pithecellobium,saman,hardwood,16,0
"Monterey pine has been listed in at least two vegetation classifications: the Closed-Cone Pine Forest Community of California (27) and the Closed-Cone Pine and Cypress Californian Floristic Province (31). The fossil record, although somewhat limited, indicates that this pine once occupied a larger range during the late Pleistocene epoch, extending almost continuously along the outer coastal strip and California islands. Fossil remains have been found at Tomales Bay, Little Sur, Carpinteria, Rancho La Brea, and Santa Cruz Island. The evidence suggests that present-day pines are survivors of an ancient oak-laurel, pine, and palm forest that grew well in a mild climate (2). Fire is a major influence affecting the extent and makeup of Monterey pine stands. Fire is frequent, sometimes of natural causes, often accidental, and sometimes deliberately set. Graziers at Cambria, for example, burned the woods to obtain more grass. At Año Nuevo, frequent fires have helped to maintain the pine forest. Without fire, the taller and longer-lived coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) would usurp land occupied by pines. Much regeneration and a number of even-aged stands at all three mainland locations can be traced directly to the influence of fire. Many of the plant species associated with Monterey pine have been listed (32). Such lists are subject to change because undisturbed stands are scarce; nearly all have been grazed, burned, or logged. At Año Nuevo, tree associates of Monterey pine are coast Douglas-fir, redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa var. ponderosa), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii). Some portions of the Monterey pine forest are pure and almost fully stocked with 370 to 740 trees per hectare (150 to 300/acre). Width of tree crowns varies with age, but rarely are crowns interlocking. Monterey pine also intermingles with Douglas-fir on middle slopes and with knobcone pine and an occasional ponderosa pine on upper drier slopes, especially where the soil is shallow and rocky. On lower slopes, redwood and an occasional madrone are present. Coast live oak, usually in the understory, also is an associate species. In some places, natural regeneration of Monterey pine is prominent, particularly where disturbance has bared the soil. Understory associates generally are not particularly diverse nor abundant at Año Nuevo. In places, however, understory vegetation fully occupies the ground. In addition to young coast live oak, the most common species are bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), coyotebrush (Baccharis pilularis), blueblossom (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus), California buckthorn (Rhamnus californica), blackberry (Rubus spp.), coast sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and several grasses. At Monterey, tree associates are coast live oak, Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa), Gowen cypress (C. goveniana), and bishop pine (Pinus muricata). Coast live oak is the most common tree associate of Monterey pine. Seldom taller than 9 m (30 ft), the oak usually is relegated to the understory. White alder (Alnus rhombifolia) and a species of willow (Salix sp.) are occasional associates in riparian zones. At least one species of willow is scattered throughout the forest on higher ground. Shrubs and forbs in the Monterey forest vary with time after disturbance and general quality of the habitat. Successionally, young stands of pines, shrubs, and forbs often become established after fire. At age 45, Monterey pine has a stand density of 160 to 200 trees per hectare (65 to 81/acre). Shaggy-bark manzanita (Arctostaphylos tomentosa) and California huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum) are prominent with an average cover of about 50 percent. By the time Monterey pine reaches age 65, competition, disease, and slow growth reduce its density to 80 to 120 trees per hectare (32 to 49/acre). In stands of this age, poison-oak, bush monkeyflower (Mimulus aurantiacus) and California blackberry (Rubus ursinus) are present and, along with the shrubs mentioned earlier, contribute to a shrub cover of about 40 percent. Openings form in the pine stand as the trees grow older but density remains about as before because younger age classes of pines contribute. Shrub cover continues at about 40 percent with poison-oak and creeping snowberry (Symphoricarpos mollis) becoming the understory dominants. In old stands where tree diameters are over 100 cm (39 in), one or more age classes of pine are present. Coast live oak sometimes constitutes 25 to 50 percent of the trees in such stands (37). At Cambria, tree associates of Monterey pine are limited to one hardwood: coast live oak. On better sites, understory vegetation near the typically open pine stands includes coast live oak, bracken, California blackberry, and poison-oak. On drier sites, coast sagebrush, coyotebrush, and bush monkeyflower are present. At the edge of the pine's natural range, grasses often are the only understory plants. On Guadalupe and Cedros Islands, vegetation associated with Monterey pine is poorly known. That reported for Guadalupe Island is island live oak (Quercus tomentella), Guadalupe Island palm (Erythea edulis), and grasses; for Cedros, bishop pine, yucca (Yucca spp.), and at least two species of cactus (Opuntia spp.).",Associated Forest Cover,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,1,1
"The Monterey pine habitat is strongly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean from which the cold waters of southward-flowing currents result in high humidity, low temperatures, and summer fogs. The minimum relative humidity at Monterey in July, for example, averages between 60 and 70 percent (23). At least one-third of the days each year are foggy (35). Temperatures tend to be mild, although extremes range from about -5° to 41° C (23° to 106° F). Mean monthly temperatures show a relatively even climate with a difference between the coldest and warmest month of about 6.5° C (12° F) in the range of 9° to 11° C (48° to 52° F) in winter and 16° to 18° C (61° to 64° F) in summer. Mean temperatures during the growing season, February through June, range from 11° to 16° C (52° to 61° F), with maximums of 17° to 24° C (63° to 75° F) (34). Frost-free days number about 300 each year. Annual precipitation ranges from about 380 to 890 mm (15 to 35 in) and varies from year to year. From December to March, precipitation averages 300 to 510 mm (12 to 20 in), with less than 50 mm (2 in) per month for the remaining months. Rain usually does not fall in July and August. During these months, however, the tree crowns collect moisture from fog that moves inland. Fog drip can amount to as much as 15 mm (0.59 in) per week at higher elevations on the Monterey Peninsula (25). No snow falls in the natural range of Monterey pine. Año Nuevo is the wettest of the three mainland locales; Cambria, the driest; and Monterey, the foggiest (3). Wind is, at best, a minor climatic influence, averaging only 7.6 km/h (4.7 mi/h) on an annual basis. May is the windiest month, August the least windy (23). The climate of Guadalupe and Cedros Islands is Mediterranean-like, possibly with less rainfall and greater temperature extremes than for mainland stands. Fog is a critical factor and, on both islands, pine stands are restricted to foggy ridges and windward slopes, or occasionally to the moist slopes of deep canyons. On Cedros Island, fog was most frequent and of maximum concentration where the pines grew, and each pine grove tended to be covered with fog while the desert between was exposed to clear sky (22).",Climate,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,2,1
"No evidence of widespread introgression from knobcone or bishop pine has been found, although hybridization is occurring locally between Monterey and knobcone pines at Año Nuevo (11). The hybrid is designated Pinus attenuata x radiata Stockwell & Righter. The two-needled pine found on Guadalupe and Cedros Islands is currently named P. radiata var. binata. The unique characteristics of rapid growth, large genetic variability, and ease of vegetative propagation have made Monterey pine the subject of intensive genetic improvement programs in several countries, notably Australia and New Zealand.",Hybrids,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,9,1
"Native stands of Monterey pine are found in three distinct areas of central-coastal California in San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Luis Obispo Counties. The northernmost stand is east of point Año Nuevo, the central stand 48 km (30 mi) to the south near Monterey and Carmel, and the southernmost stand about 105 km (65 mi) away in the Pico Creek-Cambria area (15). Seldom is the pine found more than 11 km (7 mi) from the sea. The north-south range is about 209 km (130 mi). A close relative of Monterey pine also inhabits the northeastern portion of Guadalupe Island and the northern and central parts of Cedros Island-both of which are Mexican possessions. Guadalupe Island is 740 km (460 mi) south of Cambria, and Cedros Island is 908 km (564 mi) south-southeast of Cambria. Although trees on these islands differ in morphology from those in the United States, they have now been shown to be most closely related to P. radiata (21). The area occupied by natural stands of Monterey pine on the United States mainland was once well defined, even though estimates of the total area ranged from 4860 to 6480 ha (12,000 to 16,000 acres) (28). Precise natural limits, however, are now difficult to determine because of conspicuous amounts of new regeneration. The southern part of the forest at Año Nuevo, for example, is estimated to have increased by as much as 95 ha (235 acres) in recent decades (14). Additional trees have been planted, and these also have produced seed that led to many acres of new reproduction. Nevertheless, the total area currently occupied probably is no more than 8000 ha (19,770 acres) (21). - The native range of Monterey pine.",Native Range,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,11,1
"The three mainland populations of Monterey pine, although disjunct, grow where climate and soil are similar. A large proportion of the total phenotypic variation in several branch, needle, and cone characteristics, however, is observed between individual trees at each location. The Cambria population, although less variable than the other two, differs from them in several cone, branch, and needle characteristics. In Australia these differences, plus a slower growth rate and a different pattern of seasonal growth, suggest that the Cambria population differs genetically from the northern populations (11). A recent study, however, indicates little genetic differentiation among the native populations. Most of the genetic variation is located within each stand (26).",Population Differences,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- In its native habitat, Monterey pine ""flowers"" in late winter and early spring. The species is monoecious; the numerous yellow male strobili are produced on side branches, and female flowers are produced in all parts of the crown. Monterey pine is multi-nodal and female strobili occasionally are found at a secondary whorl position (18). Seed Production and Dissemination- Fertile cones are produced as early as 5 to 10 years, but substantial crops are not yielded until age 15 or 20 if the trees are open-grown, and considerably later if the stands are dense. Cones mature in the autumn of the second season and most open during the first warm days of late winter and early spring. They range in color from lustrous nut brown to light brown when ripe, and in length from 8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 in). The ellipsoid seeds, jet black and pimpled, average about 2 cm (0.8 in) long. Monterey pines at Cambria have the largest cones and seeds; those at Monterey the smallest (11). Each cone contains from 120 to 200 seeds. Cones remain attached to the trees for many years and open and close several times, depending on temperature and humidity. Because the habitat of the species is typically cool and moist, cone opening is infrequent and of short duration, so that seeds are often retained and then disseminated over a longer period than in warmer and drier climates. Although cones and seeds are produced almost every year, seedfall varies. A relatively small number of seeds dribble out of the cones each year. In warm and dry years, seedfall can be heavy. Fire is particularly effective for opening cones and releasing large quantities of stored seeds. Several species of birds and small mammals depend in part for sustenance on the seeds of Monterey pine. Principal bird species are the scrub jay, Stellar jay, and common crow. Important small mammals are deer mice, chipmunks, and ground squirrels (7). Numerous other creatures eat the seeds of this pine, but their effect usually is insignificant. Seedling Development- Although the seeds of Monterey pine do not require stratification for good performance, germination is enhanced by it. Cold-moist stratification of 0 to 7 days is recommended for fresh seed and 7 to 20 days for stored seed. In one test with no pretreatment of seed, germinative energy was 16 percent in 7 days and germinative capacity 81 percent after 25 days at a controlled temperature of 20° C (68° F). In another test, again with no pretreatment, but where the day temperature was held at 30° C (86° F) and the night temperature at 20° C (68° F), germinative capacity was 67 percent after 28 days (18). Germination is epigeal New germinants bear a whorl of five to nine cotyledons that are succeeded by primary needles. Secondary needles in fascicle bundles form when the seedling is a few months old. After age 3, the seedling produces only secondary needles. The root system of most seedlings consists of a slender taproot, aimed straight down. Mycorrhizal associations with root tips in the upper 10 cm (4 in) of soil probably increase nutrient and water intake and enhance the growth of Monterey pine seedlings. At least 16 mycorrhizal fungi associated with Monterey pine have been identified in the United States and several others noted in other countries (28). The seedbed required for natural regeneration of Monterey pine is highly variable. The best seedbed is moist mineral soil free of competing vegetation. Numerous seedlings, however, are found where the seedbed consists of several inches of pine needles over mineral soil (23). Although unknown, these seedlings could be the survivors of a great many seedlings and they could be much older than similar-sized, free-to-grow counterparts on bare mineral soil. Seedlings develop best in full sunlight. Soil disturbed by logging and fire is conducive to seedling establishment and rapid growth. Dense slash decreases seedling density, although light slash can improve the seedling ""catch."" Optimum conditions for regeneration, however, are produced by fire; maximum numbers of cones are opened, and at least a temporarily competition-free and receptive seedbed is prepared (37). As a result, dense stands often are formed after burning. In fire-killed stands in foreign countries, Monterey pine seedlings were reported to number 1,235,500/ha (500,000/acre) and more than 2,471,000/ha (1,000,000/acre) (32). On Guadalupe Island, seedlings and saplings are scarce. ""Very dense reproduction,"" however, was recorded in places on Cedros Island (21). Pines also become established in grassland vegetation and beneath live oaks, the latter providing shade during the critical establishment period. In most instances, the pines eventually grow through the oak canopy and dominate (23). Some pines reproduce naturally under the canopies of older trees. Number and vigor of pine seedlings and saplings relate directly to the spacing of the older trees; the more dense the overstory, the fewer and slower growing the seedlings. Dense thickets often are formed in small openings. Naturally established Monterey pine seedlings are fairly large initially and grow larger quickly. Seedlings 30 to 56 cm (12 to 22 in) tall after one growing season are common. Rapid shoot growth usually starts in February and continues until September. Monterey pine apparently begins growth at colder soil temperatures than associated conifers. Lack of soil moisture limits growth in the fall. The period of growth is variable, differing from tree to tree and from season to season (23). By age 5, trees are about 6.6 cm (2.6 in) in d.b.h. and 6 m (20 ft) tall (19). By this age, seedling roots have expanded much more laterally than vertically and have formed a lateral, rather than a taproot, system. Artificial regeneration of Monterey pine in California is usually for horticultural rather than timber-growing purposes; however, several large plantations have been established for a variety of reasons. The most successful and long-lasting plantations are in central California near the Pacific Ocean (28). Monterey pine grows readily in California nurseries. Its only problem is rapid growth and stock too large for field planting. At one nursery, average seedling height was 41 cm (16 in), accumulating from the normal seeding date in April to lifting in January. Seedling size and growth are affected by seed size, soil temperature, and soil moisture. After 32 weeks, Monterey pine seedlings were taller and heavier from seeds retained by a 0.39 cm (0.15 in) mesh screen than from seeds passing through a 0.33 cm (0.13 in) screen (13). Seedling root growth was greatest at 15° C (59° F), a value 5° C (9° F) lower than the optimum soil temperature reported for other pines. Monterey pines with a predawn water potential of -1.5 MPa (-15 bars) were unable to open stomates, a phenomenon also noted at a similar value for ponderosa and lodgepole (Pinus contorta) pines (17). Vegetative Reproduction- Monterey pine does not reproduce naturally from sprouts, and no record of sprouting in natural stands is known. Reproduction from artificially rooted propagules of this pine has been successful in many trials in several countries. Hedging is one method for successfully mass-producing large numbers of symmetrical and straight cuttings and maintaining the juvenile nature of propagules (22). Plantlets from embryos and cotyledons are another (1). Cuttings, or other means of vegetative propagation, offer a number of advantages over seedlings, not the least of which is closer control of genotype. Cuttings from mature planting stock show a reduced incidence of retarded leaders, excessive branching, crooked internodes, and frost susceptibility. Vegetative propagules also tend to have straighter boles, less forking, fewer and smaller branches, less bole taper, and thinner bark (22). Height growth of cuttings generally is similar to that of seedlings, although extremes of environment and age of ortet can cause lower growth than from seedlings. Cuttings also develop a higher frequency of cones on the bole-a negative factor. This can be mitigated by pruning, however.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- On good sites, pine saplings that are free to grow and have at least moderate spacing enlarge rapidly: an increase in height of 1.2 to 2.4 m (4 to 8 ft) per year has been observed (23). By age 15, trees are 24 cm (9.4 in) in d.b.h. and 16 m (53 ft) tall (19). These values indicate a growth rate for the first 15 years that places Monterey pine among the most rapidly growing of American conifers. Although reproduction can be very dense, stands seldom, if ever, stagnate. A few saplings grow faster than their counterparts, quickly establish dominance, and eventually form the well-spaced, relatively open stands typical of older Monterey pine forests. Branches of Monterey pine saplings die when shaded but persist on the bole for many years. In dense stands, the trunks clean themselves well (35). Mature trees often have clear boles for 8 to 15 m (26 to 49 ft). Height growth of pole-sized trees on poor sites may slow down appreciably after 15 years, but on better sites, it continues at a good rate until trees are about age 50 (19). At Monterey, pole-sized trees less than 30 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. average about 20 years old and 20 m (64 ft) tall. Height of mature trees ranges from 9 to 38 m (30 to 125 ft) but generally is 21 to 30 m (69 to 98 ft), with the tallest trees often found in small gullies. Diameters vary widely and, on a good site, average just under 64 cm (25 in) in d.b.h. A few trees reach an exceptional diameter of 122 cm (48 in) in d.b.h. At Cambria, Monterey pines are a little taller, averaging 30 to 37 m (98 to 121 ft) at maturity (23). On Guadalupe Island, the tallest tree was 33 m (108 ft); the largest d.b.h. recorded was 211 cm (83 in). On Cedros Island, the tallest tree measured 32 m (105 ft); the tree with the largest d.b.h. was 77 cm (30 in) (21). Crown development of Monterey pine is a function of age and spacing. In crowded conditions, the species has a narrow pointed crown. Vigorous trees continue to have pointed crowns until 35 to 45 years of age, after which the crown becomes flat and irregular. Trees 30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) in, d.b.h. have crowns 5 to 6 m (16 to 20 ft) wide, but much narrower if crowded, and those larger than 76 cm (30 in) in d.b.h. have crowns 9 to 12 m (30 to 39 ft) wide. Trees taller than 30 m (98 ft) have a live crown one-third to one-sixth of this length (23). Monterey pine is short lived. It attains full size in 80 to 100 years and rarely lives beyond 150 years (35). Yield of Monterey pine in natural stands is lowered by the characteristically open spacing of the trees. Pine volume averages less than 281 m³/ha (4,011 ft³/acre). As stocking increases, so does productivity. A stand with better than average stocking, for example, averaged 490 m³/ha (7,003 ft³/acre). Trees were about 50 years old, 39 cm (15 in) in d.b.h., and numbered 408/ha (165/acre). The best stocked stand at Monterey contained 482 trees and 1681 m³/ha (195 trees and 24,009 ft³/acre). These trees averaged 52 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. and 29 m (95 ft) in height (19). In other countries, the yield of Monterey pine in plantations that are thinned and pruned and sometimes fertilized is much higher than that of natural stands. In New Zealand, stands 35 to 40 years old yield about 770 m³/ha (11,004 ft³/acre). On a productive site in Chile, trees 20 years old produce about 500 m³/ha (7,145 ft³/acre). They number about 270 trees per hectare (109/acre) after three thinnings, average about 48 cm (19 in) in d.b.h., and have been pruned three times (30). Rooting Habit- After age 5, the roots of pine seedlings grow downward as far as soil depth or the clay layer permit. Main support roots, however, develop in the top 61 cm (24 in), even in deeper soils (23). Studies at Monterey and Cambria showed at least a few pine roots penetrated to 1.7 m (5.5 ft) in deeper soils (8,10). The root system becomes extensive laterally and roots of mature pines extend from 9 to 12 m (30 to 39 ft) from the tree (19). Where a layer of organic matter covers the soil, large numbers of small pine roots exploit the layer for moisture and nutrients. The species is regarded as moderately windfirm on deeper soils but less so on shallow soils. Trees growing in soils saturated with moisture are vulnerable to windthrow, particularly in exposed places (24). Reaction to Competition- Because Monterey pine exists both as an overstory and an understory tree, it is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade (4)- that is, at least as tolerant as any other pine in western North America. Age and site quality, however, affect this assessment. As a sapling or seedling, the species tolerates shade but becomes less tolerant in the pole stage and is intolerant when mature (19). When overtopped, young pines can withstand a considerable amount of suppression, struggling along for 30 years or more before they die. Damaging Agents- Within its restricted range, few abiotic factors cause significant damage except pollution, especially ozone. Because of its rapid growth, Monterey pine has been planted widely along the western coast of North America. In these plantings and even in the Central Valley of California, the pine technically is an introduced species because it is exposed to environmental conditions rare in its native range. Temperatures below freezing for only a few hours seriously damage and kill trees of all ages. Trees that are rapidly growing or newly planted are susceptible to windthrow during winter storms. Sudden increases in temperature to 38° C (100° F) or greater cause needle scorch and damage to new growth (5). Fire is a particular hazard to young, thin-barked trees and can be disastrous in dense plantations where persistent lower limbs become festooned with dead needles, resulting in an ideal situation for crowning fires. Pruning to a height of 2.1 to 2.4 m (7 to 8 ft) helps keep a fire on the ground and is a desirable measure for protection (32). Pathogens of significance in the natural range of Monterey pine include a dwarf mistletoe, two gall rusts, and two root diseases. Digger pine dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium occidentale) infects trees of all ages and is found in native stands except at Aho Nuevo (32). Western gall rust (Peridermium harknessii) and coastal gall rust (P. cerebroides) are found in the three stands in the United States and cause significant damage to young trees. Cedros and Guadalupe Island populations of Monterey pine have higher resistance to western gall rust than mainland populations (29). A widespread pathogen of particular virulence is annosus root disease (Heterobasidion annosum). Armillaria root disease (Armillaria mellea) is found where oaks are present, but damage to Monterey pine is minor. Outside its natural range, Monterey pine is attacked by several pathogens in addition to those in native stands. Of these, the red band needle blight (Scirrhia pini) is the most damaging. This worldwide pathogen is not found in native stands but has caused serious damage and is a major concern for plantations in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and north-coastal California. Western gall rust is a pest in plantations from central California to British Columbia and can be damaging to Christmas tree plantations. As many as 35 other pathogens cause negligible to minor damage in exotic stands of Monterey pine (5,32). Furniss and Carolin (12) list 56 insects from 44 genera that feed on Monterey pine foliage, twigs, branches, and boles. Relatively few of these cause significant damage and only five can kill trees, especially those weakened by other agents. Four are bark beetles and one is a weevil; all are cambium feeders. Bark beetle larvae mine the cambium of all but young trees. Once the trunk is girdled, the tree dies. All four species produce broods in stumps or fresh cut limbs and logs and commonly work in concert on individual trees. The Monterey pine ips (Ips mexicanus) is seldom a primary killer except in young plantations. The California four-spined ips (I. plastographus) and pinyon ips (I. confusus) attack large and small trees. The red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) kills large, mature trees. The Monterey pine weevil (Pissodes radiatae) is primarily a threat to young trees where the larvae mine cambium in tops, stems, bases, and even portions below ground. Various other insects, including aphids, borers, caterpillars, and moths, cause minor damage. Probably the most serious of these is the Monterey pine cone beetle (Conophthorus radiatae) that attacks maturing cones in central California but does not damage the more southerly population. Animal damage to ornamental plantings can be a problem but generally is not serious. On Guadalupe Island, however, chronic overgrazing by goats has virtually eliminated Monterey pine regeneration.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,14,1
"In spite of a small and narrow natural range, Monterey pine grows on soils that are derived from a variety of parent materials. At Año Nuevo, for example, the underlying rocks are shales and marine sandstones. At Monterey, these rocks and granite are present, and at Cambria, parent materials are limestones, sandstones, cherts, and slates. Monterey pine is found on soils of four orders. Mollisols are the most prominent and include four Haploxerolls (Santa Lucia, Ben Lomond, Catelli, and Baywood soil series) (36) and four Argialbolls (San Simeon, Conception, Watsonville, and Chamise series). Ultisols are next in extent and are represented by an Albaquult (Narlon series). The Entisol order is represented by one soil series, a Xeropsamment (Tangair series), and the Alfisol order by a Palexeralf (Tierra series). At all three locations-Año Nuevo, Monterey, and Cambria-the soils have a number of similarities. Most soils are deep sandy loams, often derived from marine sediments. A thick accumulation of organic material is common beneath Monterey pine stands on good sites. The 8- to 15-cm (3- to 6-in) layer of organic material stores many times its weight in water and is a modest reservoir for nutrients. Most soils are found on sloping ground and are reasonably well drained, at least down to a clay layer at the 50- to 85-cm (20- to 33-in) depth. The clay layer is of critical importance. Pine roots generally do not extend far into this layer, but many penetrate for a short distance. Such roots have been observed to be well inoculated with mycorrhizae (10). Another common attribute of soils supporting Monterey pine is that soil pH generally is acid, even extremely acid. Acidity often is high at or just above the clay layer. The combination of poor drainage and high acidity seems to enhance mycorrhizal formation. The clay layer, then, intercepts winter rains and forms a reservoir of water that is available for most of the year. Mycorrhizae on roots at or in the clay layer enhance the nutrient- and water-gathering capability of the pines. Of the seven most common mycorrhizal species that colonize the roots of Monterey pine seedlings in nurseries, Rhizopogon rubescens and R. luteolus enhanced height growth and nutrient uptake the most (6). In general, the topography on which Monterey pine grows is hilly and gently to moderately sloping. With one possible exception in the Santa Lucia Mountains, elevations range from sea level to about 305 m (1,000 ft). At the three mainland elevations, the most extensive stands are found on modest slopes or gently rolling terrain between the ocean and steeper inland hills. The pine is found on north aspects at all locations and shifts from all aspects at Año Nuevo, through presence only in sheltered canyons on south aspects at Monterey, to complete absence on all other aspects at Cambria. On Guadalupe and Cedros Islands, stands are found on gentle to steep slopes at elevational ranges of 300 to 1100 m (980 to 3,610 ft) on Guadalupe, and 275 to 640 m (900 to 2,100 ft) on Cedros (21). Limitations in habitat at each location probably contribute to the areal extent of the Monterey pine stands. At Año Nuevo, shallow soil near the coast could be limiting. At Monterey, lower rainfall together with differences in soil depth, texture, and location of clay layer could govern distribution. At Cambria, climate and soil mandate a shift from trees to grass and shrubs. Among the three mainland areas, where genetically controlled differences in tolerance to cold have been noted, the tolerance decreases from north to south (16). Recently, analyses of satellite photos taken over several years have shown that the present groves of closed-cone pines ""are all at centers of high fog concentrations"" (3). For the three mainland areas, the factor limiting the natural range of Monterey pine at its eastern boundary could be fog, but fog does not sufficiently explain the abrupt northern and southern termination of the pines' natural range. Farther south on Guadalupe and Cedros Islands, absence of fog appears to limit the distribution of the species. In spite of these evident limitations, the causes of restrictions on the range of Monterey pine are not clear.",Soils and Topography,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,15,1
"The wood of Monterey pine is light, soft, brittle, and coarse-grained. The trunk is characterized by a large amount of crook and other irregularities, a small percentage of clear bole, and frequent presence of disease. These characteristics cause the species to be of little commercial value for lumber and wood products in the United States. Past commodity use has been for coarse lumber in a localized market and for fuelwood. In marked contrast, the species is valued for wood products in many other countries. A major use of this pine is as an ornamental in parks and urban areas. The species often is planted in areas devoid of trees where its rapid growth and attractive foliage quickly provide variety and contrast to the landscape. The pine also is planted extensively to help establish vegetative control of eroding and blowing soils. Prized as a living screen against wind, noise, and traffic, Monterey pine graces many a boulevard and backyard in urban areas. It also has been asexually propagated for Christmas trees (33). In its native habitat and particularly near the ocean, the rugged, picturesque, wind-battered trees deserve special mention for their esthetic appeal. Stands near Carmel, CA, are among the most photographed in the world.",Special Uses,Monterey Pine,pinus,radiata,conifer,16,1
"The mountain hemlock zone includes the upper Canadian and most of the Hudsonian Life Zones (11) and includes all of the forest cover type Mountain Hemlock (Society of American Foresters, Type 205) (16). Mountain hemlock is a major component of Coastal True Fir-Hemlock (Type 226), California Mixed Subalpine (Type 256) and (in the Cascade Range) Whitebark Pine (Type 208). Mountain hemlock is a minor associate in 12 other coniferous types: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206), Red Fir (Type 207), Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Western Larch (Type 212), Western White Pine (Type 215), Lodgepole Pine (Type 218), Sitka Spruce (Type 223), Western Hemlock (Type 224), Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce (Type 225), Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock (Type 227), Western Redcedar (Type 228), and Port-Orford-Cedar (Type 231). Mountain hemlock usually grows in mixture with other trees, and it has many associates, as is evident from the large number of forest types in which it is found. Though pure stands are less common than mixed stands, there are extensive pure stands of mountain hemlock in Alaska (11) and in the central high Cascades of Oregon (20). One of the most widespread mountain hemlock communities is the mountain hemlock-Pacific silver fir/big huckleberry (Tsuga mertensiana-Abies amabilis/Vaccinium membranaceum) type found in British Columbia (9) and the Oregon and Washington Cascades (1,20). In British Columbia, the understory is dominated by deciduous ericaceous shrubs: Cascades azalea (Rhododendron albiflorum), Alaska huckleberry (Vaccinium alaskaense), rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), ovalleaf huckleberry (Vaccinium ovalifolium), and big huckleberry. Also included are strawberryleaf blackberry (Rubus pedatus) and several mosses. Silver fir and Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) are common tree associates in this community in coastal areas, and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) are common associates in inland areas (9). In the Rocky Mountains, the mountain hemlock/beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax) habitat type is generally found on south slopes and is characterized by a high cover of beargrass with big huckleberry and grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium) as common associates (12,63). Subalpine fir and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are common arborescent associates. A similar Pacific silver fir-mountain hemlock/beargrass association is found in Oregon (20). The extensive pure or nearly pure mountain hemlock forests in the high Cascades of Oregon are primarily in the mountain hemlock/grouse whortleberry community (38,42,48,72). Except for grouse whortleberry, understory plant cover is generally low, long-stoloned sedge (Carex pensylvanica) being the most commonly mentioned associate. Mountain hemlock forests in Crater Lake National Park were classified with 89 percent accuracy using Landsat imagery (86), which offers hope for broadscale mapping of this forest type.",Associated Forest Cover,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,1,1
"Areas occupied by mountain hemlock generally have a cool to cold maritime climate that includes mild to cold winters, a short, warm to cool growing season and moderate to high precipitation (table 1). Annual and summer precipitation and the proportion of precipitation as snow show notable latitudinal climatic trends in the range of mountain hemlock (table 1). Latitudinal trends in mean temperatures are not evident. The high snowfall results in snowpacks with maximum depths that range from 245 cm (96 in) in Idaho to 380 cm (150 in) in British Columbia (9). A snowpack may cover the ground for long periods (7 to 10 months in southwestern British Columbia) (9). The relatively short growing season (frost-free period) ranges from 95 to 148 days in southwestern British Columbia (9,45) and from 49 to 63 days in the central Sierra Nevada (64). Climatic extremes include a temperature range of -29° to 38° C (-20° to 100° F) (11), annual snowfall in excess of 2200 cm (866 in) (66), snowpack up to 750 cm (295 in) (20), and persistence of the snowpack until August or September (9,66). Because there are few weather stations in the range of mountain hemlock, reported extremes are probably often exceeded. Mountain hemlock grows in an altitudinal band 300 to 1000 m (1,000 to 3,300 ft) wide that increases in altitude from north to south: The presence of mountain hemlock in the Rocky Mountains is closely correlated with the eastward penetration of moist maritime air masses (33). On the east side of the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, mountain hemlock is limited to relatively moist sites where snow accumulates early in the fall (46). Krajina (46) proposes that mountain hemlock does not grow on sites with later, thinner snowpacks because it cannot tolerate the frozen soils there. Throughout most of the range of mountain hemlock local climate differentiates two types of subalpine mountain hemlock forest. A parkland subzone of single trees and small tree clumps (average canopy cover less than 25 percent) extends from treeline or near treeline to the lower forest subzone of relatively continuous forest cover (canopy cover more than 25 percent) (2,9,21,82). Most climatic data (table 1) are from the forest subzone. Detailed microclimatic data (9) and data extrapolated upslope from the weather stations (45) in southwestern British Columbia indicate that the parkland subzone has shorter frost-free and snow-free periods and that maximum snowpack, range of summer temperatures, and actual evapotranspiration are greater than in the forest subzone. Mountain hemlock also grows above treeline in the alpine environment as prostrate krummholz (elfinwood) throughout most of its range (10,20,35). If climate warms as hypothesized for western North America (24), existing mountain hemlock forests will probably increase in productivity; upper and lower boundaries of the mountain hemlock zone, within which new mountain hemlock forests become established after disturbance, will increase in elevation; and the zone will decrease in area. Near Mount Baker, Washington, ring width of mountain hemlock increases with increasing monthly temperatures in the preceding 12 months, decreasing winter precipitation (37), and decreasing spring snow depth, down to about 1 m (3.3 ft) (27). This implies productivity should increase with predicted temperature increases. Graumlich and others (28) estimated that productivity increased 60 percent in the last century in four high-elevation stands in Washington, three of which contained 48 to 96 percent mountain hemlock. They related this increase most strongly to the increase in growing-season temperature during this period (about 1.5° C or 2.7° F). Thus, further increases in temperature may cause further increases in productivity. Based on the current elevational distribution of major forest zones in the Oregon Cascades and a mean temperature lapse rate of 4.4° C/100 m (2.4° F/1,000 ft), Franklin and others (24) have hypothesized the effects of two warmer climates. If mean annual temperature increases 2.5° C (4.5° F), the mountain hemlock zone in Oregon may be shifted upwards 570 m (1,900 ft) and decrease in area from 9 to 2 percent; an increase of 5.0° C (9° F) may move it upwards 1140 m (3,700 ft)-above all but the tallest peaks-so it is effectively eliminated.",Climate,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,2,1
"Mountain hemlock has several morphological characteristics that separate it from most other species of Tsuga, including branchlets not all in one plane; needles radially arranged, relatively thick, with stomata on both surfaces; cones generally larger with more scales; and pollen with air bladders. Because of these spruce-like characteristics, the genetic background of mountain hemlock was under some question (11,13) until recently. Mountain hemlock was proposed as a hybrid between western hemlock and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) by several French taxonomists and assigned to the new genus Tsugo-Picea (see references in 11,13). Recent studies of pollination mechanisms (59), embryology (61), and leaf pigment chemistry (74), however, place the species firmly in the genus Tsuga. These studies are consistent with the proposal by Taylor (74) that Picea and Tsuga are closely related genera, and mountain hemlock is more similar to Picea than are other Tsuga species (59,74). Individuals morphologically intermediate between western hemlock and mountain hemlock are occasionally found where the two species occupy the same site. These populations have been given hybrid status (Tsuga x jeffreyi (Henry) Henry) (11, 13,47). A study of leaf pigment chemistry of 43 morphologically intermediate individuals collected from throughout western Washington indicated, however, that only three (all from Corral Pass near Mount Rainier) were chemically intermediate and so were potentially of hybrid origin (74). Six leaf cuticle characteristics of Tsuga x jeffreyi in Britain were similar to mountain hemlock and dissimilar to western hemlock (70), also not supporting hybrid status. The limited overlap in the timing of pollen release (14) and failure of all known controlled pollinations to produce filled seeds (in British Columbia (53) and in Oregon (cited in 74) support the conclusion that true hybrids are probably much rarer than the morphological intermediates on which hybrid status is based, if such hybrids occur at all. A California form of mountain hemlock has been given specific status (Tsuga crassifolia Flous) and is proposed as a hybrid between Engelmann spruce and mountain hemlock (13). The hybrid swarms expected from backcrosses with the parent taxa have not been observed (13), however, and this specific status and phylogeny are not generally recognized by taxonomists (17,47,57). All mountain hemlock in the Siskiyou Mountains from the Oregon-California border south were recently given subspecific status as Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carr. ssp. grandicona Farjon, in recognition of the generally larger cones of trees in this region (17,63). This classification is less ambitious than the new species T. crassifolia. Clausen (10) studied the mountain hemlock phenotypes of erect simple stems and prostrate krummholz (elfinwood) over a gradient in elevation (3050 to 3350 m; 10,000 to 11,000 ft) in the Sierra Nevada and described them as genetic races. It has not been determined, however, whether these growth forms have different genotypes or result solely from different environments.",Genetics,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,7,1
"Mountain hemlock grows from Sequoia National Park in California (lat. 36° 38' N.) (62) to Cook Inlet in Alaska (lat. 61° 25' N.) (83). It grows along the crest of the Sierra Nevada in California (31); the Cascade Range in Oregon; the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains in Washington; the northern Rocky Mountains in Idaho and western Montana; the Insular, Coast, and Columbia Mountains in British Columbia; and in southeast and south-central Alaska. - The native range of mountain hemlock.",Native Range,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Mountain hemlock is monoecious. Pollen release occurs in June in the Cascade Range in Oregon (11), from mid-June to mid July in British Columbia (14,61), and from mid-May to late June in Alaska. In a British Columbia study, mountain hemlock and subalpine fir were the last of 10 species to release pollen (14). Daytime temperature appeared to be the most important variable regulating release of pollen, with more release (and by inference more pollination) on warm, dry days. Both protogyny (53) and synchrony between pollen release and female cone receptivity on individual trees have been observed in British Columbia. Fertilization occurs from about late July to early August in British Columbia (61). Reproductive buds can easily be identified in the late summer and fall (15). Many female strobili indicate the potential for a large cone crop next year. Mature cones are oblong, purple or brownish purple, and are generally longer than the other species of Tsuga (2 to 9 cm or 0.75 to 3.5 in) (53). Owens and Molder (60) have thoroughly described the reproductive cycle of mountain hemlock. Seed Production and Dissemination- Three years of data from British Columbia indicate that high temperatures in July the year before cone production favor cone-bud initiation (14). Cones ripen and open from late September to November (11,61). Wild mountain hemlock as young as 20 years may bear cones (11,65). A study of cone-bud initiation indicates it may be possible to induce cone production at younger ages (58). Mature trees 175 to 250 years old produce medium to very heavy cone crops at about 3-year intervals in Oregon and Washington but crops may be complete failures in other years (22). Mountain hemlock seeds are dispersed primarily by wind. During a bumper mountain hemlock seed year in Oregon, seedfall at the clearcut-forest boundary was very high (215,000 to 4,144,000/ha or 87,000 to 1,677,000/acre) and was greatest at the south edge and least at the north edge of a gently sloping 12.5-ha (31-acre) clearcut (21). Seedfall was correlated with stand basal area in this study, as basal areas at the north and south edges were 34 and 94 m²/ha (149 and 410 ft²/acre), respectively. Seedfall was much less 114 m (375 ft) from the edge of the clearcut but was still quite heavy (40,000 to 230,000/ha or 16,000 to 93,000/acre). Sound seed in this study varied from 36 to 76 percent over 2 years. Germination of mountain hemlock seed ranges from 47 to 75 percent (66). Seedling Development- Mountain hemlock is easily transplanted and propagated by seed and cuttings (76). Heavy seeds germinate more rapidly (44). Germination, which is epigeal, occurs on snow, mineral soil, or organic soil if sufficient moisture is available. Young seedlings grow best in partial shade (11), and early development is often slow. Increasing light intensity and day-length increase seedling height but delay or prevent terminal-bud formation under shelter (4). Stem dissection of trees on the east side of the Oregon Cascades shows that growth to breast height in natural stands is slower on sites thought to have a late-lying snowpack than on warmer sites. Mountain hemlock is generally slow to regenerate after disturbances such as logging, site preparation, or wildfire. Most burned areas in the mountain hemlock zone on the Olympic Peninsula do not have adequate stocking for commercial forests (600 trees/ha 1,500/acre) even 55 to 88 years after wildfires (3). Reproduction is greater during normal-to-wet growing seasons, than during dry growing seasons, and greater in areas near live trees at the edge of fires and near trees that survive the fires than in areas farther from seed sources. In the parkland subzone, reproduction is limited to the margins of tree clumps (48,72), except when successive years with earlier than normal snowmelt allow invasion of subalpine meadows (3,23). Young stands 20 to 40 years old (some in burned areas) in southern Oregon and northern California may be pure mountain hemlock and quite dense (9,900 to 24,700 trees/ha, or 4,000 to 10,000/acre) (11). In Oregon, mountain hemlock forests typically regenerate slowly after they are clearcut. In a study of 25 clearcuts, 5 to 11 years were required to reach 60-percent stocking on 0.0012-ha (0.003-acre) subplots (56). Establishment of seedlings during the first 2 years in an Oregon shelterwood cut was very low because germinants were few at low residual basal areas (less than 11.5 m²/ha or 50 ft²/acre) and all seedlings died at all higher basal areas (69). The normally slow restocking process is retarded by slash treatment. On the east side of the Cascade Range in Oregon, treated (generally piled and burned) clearcuts had lower stocking (33 percent based on 0.0004-ha (0.001-acre) subplots) than untreated clearcuts (57 percent) because of destruction of advance regeneration and a 50-percent decrease in the number of subplots stocked with natural, post-harvest reproduction (61). These clearcuts ranged from 3 to 19 years old. Stocking of mountain hemlock and its associates near Willamette Pass, OR, in 13-year-old strip cuts with unburned slash was 95 percent (on subplots of 0.0012 ha or 0.003 acre), compared with 82 percent in units that had been burned. The difference was due to advance regeneration of silver fir and mountain hemlock in the unburned clearcuts. These studies indicate that stocking in clearcuts in the mountain hemlock zone is typically made up of post-harvest naturally seeded trees, such as mountain hemlock, Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis), silver fir, lodgepole pine, and western white pine (Pinus monticola); and advance regeneration of mountain hemlock and Shasta red fir (56,67). Planting has been relatively ineffective in speeding regeneration on these cold, snowy sites compared with advance and post-harvest natural regeneration that slowly provide adequate to abundant stocking. Healthy mountain hemlock saplings (mean d.b.h. 4.5 cm, 1.8 in) respond well to release, in both diameter and height growth (68). Understory saplings with crown ratios greater than 50 percent and growing fastest before release will likely be the best crop trees (68). Regeneration of mountain hemlock varies in response to environmental gradients. In six strip cuts at Willamette Pass, OR, it decreases from the south (shaded) side to the north (unshaded) side. In the Cascade Range in central Oregon, it decreases with increasing cover of grass and forbs (67). Near Windigo Pass, OR, mountain hemlock makes up an increasing proportion of tree regeneration as elevation and pumice depth increase (56) and so becomes increasingly important for reforesting these harsher sites. In Oregon, the proportion of mountain hemlock to other species in clearcuts and burned areas typically is lower than that in surrounding mature stands, whereas the proportion of lodgepole pine, western white pine, and Shasta red fir reproduction is relatively higher. Seedlings and small saplings of mountain hemlock tolerate heavy snowpacks well. Bent boles and branches spring erect after snowmelt. Leader replacement by axial buds is less frequent than in other North American hemlocks, and the drooping leaders take 3 or more years to become erect (40). Vegetative Reproduction- Layering is an important method of reproduction on muskegs and krummholz in Alaska but is insignificant in subalpine tree clumps in the north Cascades of Washington (48) and in forested areas in general.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Mature trees range in height from 15 m (50 ft) on poor sites to 46 m (150 ft) on the best sites. Depending on stocking, diameters of old trees range from 30 cm (12 in) on poor sites to 150 cm (60 in) on good sites. The record tree of the American Forestry Association's list of big trees is 34.4 m (113 ft) tall and 224 cm (88 in) in d.b.h. Mountain hemlocks 700 to 800 or more years old are reported in British Columbia (9) and at Mount Rainier National Park, WA. Mountain hemlock grows slowly in height (fig. 1) and in diameter. Three investigators found that stem-dissected trees in Oregon and southern Washington without signs of impeded height growth were only 7 to 28 m (23 to 91 ft) tall at 100 years (39,43,54). Height growth of mountain hemlock is initially slower than that of western hemlock but continues at a moderate rate to greater age. As a result, use of western hemlock site curves in old mountain hemlock stands leads to large overestimates of growth and yield (39). Figure 1- Height growth curves for two mountain hemlock communities on the east side of the Cascade range in central Oregon (adapted from 43). Mean site index (base age 100 years) and form of height growth curve differ markedly be- tween communities. Site index (base age 100 years) and the form of the height growth curve are different in different plant communities in the central Oregon Cascades (fig. 1) (43). The mountain hemlock/smooth woodrush (Tsuga mertensiana/Luzula hitchcockii) and mountain hemlock/prince's-pine-pinemat manzanita (T. mertensiana/Chimaphila umbellata-Arctostaphylos nevadensis) communities have ranges in site index of 7 to 14 m (23 to 46 ft) and 13 to 19 m (43 to 62 ft), respectively. In the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, site index (base age 100 years) ranges from less than 6 m (20 ft) on xeric sites to 34 m (110 ft) on the best sites (46). Mountain hemlock stands at least 200 years old can have high basal areas and volumes; the highest values are in mixed species stands. In the mountain hemlock zone in British Columbia, stands in which that species makes up more than half the volume (59 to 79 percent) have volumes of 125 to 924 m³/ha (1,786 to 13,204 ft³/acre); volumes are much higher (range 588 to 1348 m³/ha, 8,397 to 19,260 ft³/acre) in stands where mountain hemlock makes up less than half the volume (9 to 36 percent) (9). These more productive mixed-species stands usually grow on deeper soils irrigated by seepage and have a slightly longer average snow-free period, whereas the communities in which mountain hemlock forms a majority of the stocking occupy the poorer, colder sites. A similar pattern occurs in the Cascade Range in southern Oregon (42). The mountain hemlock/grouse whortleberry community (nearly pure mountain hemlock) produces an estimated 1.0 m³/ha (14 ft³/acre) per year, and the Shasta red fir-mountain hemlock/pinemat manzanita/long-stoloned sedge community produces an estimated 3.8 to 9.8 m³/ha (54 to 140 ft³/acre) per year (42). The latter community tends to grow on warmer sites, and most of the productivity is by Shasta red fir, not mountain hemlock. Basal areas of both communities are high, 76 and 62 m²/ha (330 and 270 ft²/acre), respectively. Mountain hemlock communities in the western Cascades of Oregon and Washington commonly have a mixture of other tree species; estimated productivity ranges from 3.8 to 7.6 m³/ha (54 to 108 ft³/acre) per year (8,38). Volume tables are available for mountain hemlock for Alaska (32) and the central Oregon Cascades (6). Volume growth, biomass, and leaf area equations are also available (1,26,71,81,87). Leaf area index (all sides), like volume productivity, is lower in nearly pure mountain hemlock forest (10 m²/m² or 10 ft²/ft²) (25) than in mixed species forest (35 m²/m² or 35 ft²/ft²) (88) in the Cascade Range. Rooting Habit- Mountain hemlock is usually shallow rooted. In British Columbia, roots are mainly confined to the forest floor (9,45). This is not surprising because of the high proportion of soil nutrients in the forest floors of these forests. Mountain hemlock will root adventitiously when, for example, 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) of volcanic tephra is added to the soil surface (91). Two-thirds to three-quarters of the net primary productivity (NPP) is allocated below ground, according to the available data on three stands 130 to 280 years old dominated by silver fir but with significant mountain hemlock components (30,84). This high allocation below ground is probably caused by the need to obtain sufficient nutrients in these infertile soils (30). Mycorrhizae were found to be important sinks for carbon and components of nutrient cycles in one stand (84). Reaction to Competition- Mountain hemlock is classed as tolerant of shade and other forms of competition (10,48,55) and, based on synecological studies, is more tolerant than all its associates except Pacific silver fir (46), western hemlock, and Alaska-cedar. Mountain hemlock is considered a minor climax species on most of its habitats; however, it pioneers on glacial moraines in British Columbia and Alaska (11) where it is nevertheless considered indicative of the climax forest (46); also see references in 19). Pacific silver fir is a major climax species in many communities of the mountain hemlock forest subzone in British Columbia (9) and Washington and northern Oregon (20). Alaska-cedar, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), however, are climax associates on some sites. Mountain hemlock is more commonly the major climax species in the mountain hemlock zone south of central Oregon where Pacific silver fir does not occur. Mountain hemlock often succeeds lodgepole pine or subalpine fir when these species pioneer on drier sites (20). It also tends to replace Engelmann spruce when the two species occur together, possibly because hemlock is better able to withstand the allelopathic effects of spruce than are other associated species (76). Damaging Agents- The most striking damage to mountain hemlock is probably that caused by laminated root rot (Phellinus weiri) in the high Cascades of central Oregon (49). This fungus spreads from centers of infection along tree roots so that all trees are killed in circular areas that expand radially. Mountain hemlock is the most susceptible tree in these forests (18,49), and Phellinus moves faster (34 cm/yr; 13.3 in/yr) through nearly pure mountain hemlock (91 percent hemlock) than through a more heterogeneous conifer (74 percent hemlock) stand (23 cm/yr; 9.1 in/yr) (49). Growth and coalescence of Phellinus pockets have produced infected areas of more than 40 ha (100 acres). The low levels of available nitrogen in the forest floor and mineral soil (51) stress mountain hemlock, increasing its susceptibility to infection by Phellinus, as indicated by a seedling growth chamber study (52). Seedlings of mountain hemlock and associated species recolonize disease-killed areas immediately behind the advancing mortality front. These seedlings are apparently not susceptible to reinfection by P. weiri for 80 to 120 years (89). This may be due to greater vigor caused by higher levels of available nitrogen (up to a 4-fold increase), higher temperatures, and more growing-season moisture in this regrowth zone (7,89). Other common fungal pests of mountain hemlock include several heart rots (Heterobasidion annosum, Phellinus pini, Fomitopsis pinicola, and Phaeolus schweinitzii) (11,72), of which Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorum) is perhaps the most common and damaging (42). Several needle diseases and a snow mold (Herpotrichia nigra) also attack mountain hemlock but are not considered serious pests (11). The mountain hemlock race of hemlock dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense) is a potentially damaging parasite that causes witches' broom, reduction in vigor, and occasionally death (11,50). It is found throughout most of the range of mountain hemlock, but reported infection of mountain hemlock decreases from Washington north (36). Dwarf mistletoe rarely infects mountain hemlock in Alaska, though western hemlock is often infected. Several defoliating insects, bark beetles, and wood-boring insects attack mountain hemlock but do not cause extensive damage (11). Before effective fire suppression, many mountain hemlock stands south of Alaska probably succumbed to fire, as is indicated by the many young stands (11,20). The species is considered susceptible to fire because it often retains branches almost to the ground, grows in clusters, and, in Oregon, often has well-developed forest floors that dry out in the summer (72). Wind commonly destroys trees in the coastal strip of British Columbia (45) and Alaska where fire is not important (35). As cutting is increased in mountain hemlock forests, wind damage will probably become a more common cause of mortality of this shallow-rooted species. Periodic snow breakage may remove 2 to 6.5 percent of the foliage mass (29). After the eruption of Mount St. Helens and deposition of tephra on foliage and soil (18 cm, 7 in), growth slowed but trees did not die (41).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,14,1
"Over its range, mountain hemlock grows on soils derived from a wide variety of parent materials, including those of volcanic, sedimentary, metamorphic, and glacial origin. It is, however, relatively rare and stunted on soils derived from calcareous parent materials in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia (11). Mountain hemlock was not found on calcareous parent materials in the Rocky Mountains of the United States, but edaphic factors influencing its distribution in that area are not clear (12,63). Mountain hemlock is reported on organic soils (Histosols) in the northern portion of its range (9,82) more often than in the southern portion (62,64). In Alaska it is found down to sea level on noncommercial forest land on organic soils bordering muskegs where it may be a major stand component (35). A stunted or prostrate form is often found on these muskegs. It also grows below its usual altitudinal range in British Columbia on poorly drained sites where other species offer little competition (11). Best development of mountain hemlock is on loose, coarse-textured, well-drained soils with adequate moisture (9,11,62), and in British Columbia (9), on thick and very acidic organic matter and decayed wood. Adequate soil moisture appears to be especially important in California (11,62) and Montana (33)- portions of its range where summer drought is most pronounced. Mature soils typically found under mountain hemlock stands in Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington are Cryaquods and Cryorthods of the order Spodosols. These soils typically have a 13- to 28-cm (5- to 11-in) forest floor with a root mor or mycelial root mor humus layer in British Columbia (9), and a 5- to 10-cm (2- to 4-in) forest floor with a mor or duff mull humus layer in the Washington Cascades (20). In the central and southern Oregon Cascades and in northeastern Washington and northern Idaho, mature soils are generally weakly developed Haplorthods with densely matted felty mor humus layers 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) thick (12,20,90). Mountain hemlock also commonly grows on immature soils (Entisols and Inceptisols). For example, it grows on Andepts (soils derived from volcanic ash) in the Cascade Range in Oregon (38,42). Forest floors and mineral soil surfaces of pumice and ash soils supporting mountain hemlock in Oregon show moderate resistance to wetting when dry (42). Stands dominated by mountain hemlock typically have very acidic forest floors (pH 3.4 to 5.0, rarely 6.0) and mineral soils (pH 4.2 to 6.2) with low base saturation (9 to 18, rarely 37 percent) in British Columbia (9), Washington, Oregon (77,90), and northern Idaho (12). Mountain hemlock accumulates aluminum in its foliage and fine roots, so it may increase the acidity and speed up podzolization of these soils (85). Total nitrogen in the forest floor (0.4 to 1.13 percent) and mineral soil (0.05 to 0.4 percent) in British Columbia (9), Washington, and Oregon (51,77,90) are comparable to those of other coniferous forests in the region. Levels of available nitrogen in an old-growth stand in Oregon, as indexed by 7-day anaerobic 40° C (104° F) incubations, are extremely low in the mineral soil (1.7 to -2.3 µg N/g) and 100 times higher but still low in the forest floor (45 to 225 µg N/g) relative to levels for lower elevation stands in Oregon and Washington (51). A study of forests on an altitudinal gradient in western Oregon indicates that, as for available nitrogen, a high proportion of soil calcium (98 percent), organic matter (50 percent), and total nitrogen (34 percent) is in the forest floor relative to most lower elevation forest types (77). Because of this, nutrients in the forest floor are very important to the productivity of these forests. These edaphic differences are caused by slower (measured) decomposition rates caused in large part by lower temperatures and, on some sites, by the youth and infertility of the volcanic ash parent material. Mountain hemlock will grow on most landforms, but individuals typically develop best in mixed stands of the forest subzone on sheltered slopes or in draws. From southern British Columbia south, the tree grows better on northerly exposures (11). The preference for relatively moist, cool sites evidently becomes a necessity as the climate becomes more continental in western Montana (33) and more mediterranean in the central Sierra Nevada (62) at these extremes of its range. In these locations, mountain hemlock typically grows in isolated populations in north-facing glens and cirque basins where snow collects and may remain well into summer. Limited data on stomatal behavior from Carson Pass, CA, indicate that mountain hemlock is adapted to sites with long-lasting snowpacks. In the spring, mountain hemlocks emerging through 2 to 4 m (7 to 13 ft) of snow were transpiring and, presumably, photosynthesizing (73), whereas nearby whitebark pines (Pinus albicaulis) did not transpire until the soil beneath them was free of snow. Water uptake by seedlings in a greenhouse decreases to near zero at soil water potential of about -2 MPa (versus about -3 MPa for Douglas-fir) because of greater uptake resistance (5). Such decreases suggest that mountain hemlock is less well adapted to droughty sites or sites with high evaporative demand.",Soils and Topography,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,15,1
"Perhaps the most important use of mountain hemlock is for watershed protection and the scenic beauty it adds to subalpine landscapes. It is well adapted to produce attractive forest on the more extreme subalpine sites. The Mount Jefferson and Three Sisters Wildernesses, heavily used year-round recreation areas in Oregon, provide excellent examples. Stands of this species are said to be well suited to the conservation of snow (see references in 19). Its slow growth contributes to its attractive, dense foliage and usually balanced form so that it is a desirable ornamental, including the cultivars that make fine dwarf specimens or have silvery foliage (76). Some mountain hemlock forest types are important deer summer range on Vancouver Island (34). A shrubby plant association (Mountain Hemlock-Copperbush) there provides abundant browse in old stands as well as in early seral conditions, so harvesting does not significantly affect food availability.",Special Uses,Mountain Hemlock,tsuga,mertensiana,conifer,16,1
"Noble fir is associated with most other Pacific Northwest conifers at some point in its range. Most commonly these are Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), western and mountain hemlocks (Tsuga heterophylla and T. mertensiana), western white and lodgepole pines (Pinus monticola and P.contorta), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis). It is also found growing with grand and subalpine firs (Abies grandis and A. lasiocarpa), Engelmann and Sitka spruces (Picea engelmannii and P. sitchensis), western larch (Larix occidentalis), and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). Noble fir is a component of five forest cover types (4): Mountain Hemlock (Society of American Foresters Type 205), Western Hemlock (Type 224), Coastal True Fir-Hemlock (Type 226), Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), and Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock (Type 230). It is a significant component only in Type 226, where noble fir stands are recognized as a major variant. Most noble fir is found primarily within the Abies amabilis zone (10) with lesser amounts in the Tsuga mertensiana (particularly in Oregon) and Tsuga heterophylla (particularly in Washington) zones. It is a component of many recognized plant community and habitat types within these zones (3,7,9). Noble fir presence by habitat type in southern Washington (9) is typical of the general pattern. Noble fir is poorly represented on colder sites in the Tsuga mertensiana zone and is scarce in the very widespread and environmentally moderate Abies amabilis/Vaccinium alaskaense habitat type. It is abundant in the relatively warm, well-watered Abies amabilis / Tiarella unifoliata habitat type and in the Abies amabilis/Xerophyllum tenax habitat type. Noble fir attains best development on sites characterized by rich herbaceous understories. Understory plants associated with noble fir typically include an array of ericaceous shrubs and evergreen herbs. Shrubs (10) include rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), Alaska huckleberry (Vaccinium alaskaense), big huckleberry (V. membranaceum), red huckleberry (V. parvifolium), ovalleaf huckleberry (V. ovalifolium), Cascades azalea (Rhododendron albiflorum), Pacific rhododendron (R. macrophyllum), and various currants (Ribes spp.). Common herbs include beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), two trailing blackberries (Rubus lasiococcus and R. pedatus), avalanche fawnlily (Erythronium montanum), queenscup (Clintonia uniflora), purple twistedstalk (Streptopus roseus), slim Solomon's seal (Smilacina sessilifolia), coolwort foamflower (Tiarella unifoliata), and white inside-out-flower (Vancouveria hexandra).",Associated Forest Cover,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,1,1
"Noble fir lies entirely within a moist, maritime climatic region. Since it grows primarily at higher elevations-within the Abies amabilis zone (10) high precipitation and relatively cool temperatures are characteristic. Five climatic stations within the range of noble fir provide representative data. Annual temperatures average 4.4° to 7.2° C (39.9° to 45.0° F). The mean temperature in January ranges from -4.4° to -1.1° C (24.1° to 30.0° F) and in July, from 13.3° to 16.1° C (55.9° to 60.9° F). Annual precipitation averages 1960 to 2410 mm (77.2 to 94.9 in). About three-fourths of this precipitation occurs between October and March, and much of it accumulates as snowpacks with maximum depths of 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft).",Climate,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,2,1
"Noble fir has a high self-fertility (27). Selfing produced 69 percent of the sound seeds produced by outcross pollination; there was no difference between selfed and outcrossed progeny in weight and germination of seeds or in survival after 3 years. The number of cotyledons was greater for selfed individuals, but 3- and 10-year height growth was less. Survival of outplanted outcross trees did not differ after 10 years from that of wind-pollinated and selfed trees.",Genetics,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,7,1
"No races of noble fir are known within its natural range, but three horticultural varieties (glauca, prostrata, and robustifolia) are known. Noble fir has been artificially crossed with several other true firs. It interbreeds readily with California red fir, and reciprocal crossings have high yields of viable seed. Some noble fir parents yield nearly as much seed from pollen of California red fir as from local noble fir pollen. Other crossings reported in the literature are Abies concolor (supposedly ""confirmed""),recurvata, sachalinensis, balsamea, and lasiocarpa. None of these have been repeated, however, and all are seriously questioned as to validity.",Hybrids,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,9,1
"Noble fir is found in the mountains of northern Oregon and Washington between the McKenzie River and Stevens Pass or latitudes 44° and 48° N. Most of its distribution is within the Cascade Range, particularly on the western slopes and along the crest. Isolated populations are found on peaks in the Oregon Coast Ranges and in the Willapa Hills of southwestern Washington. Trees with needle and cone characteristics of noble fir have frequently been reported in mixture with California and Shasta red firs (Abies magnifica var. magnifica and var. shastensis) from northern California north to the central Cascade Range in Oregon. Studies of weight of seeds, number of cotyledons, and chemistry of terpenes strongly suggest that the populations north of the McKenzie River differ from the remainder of the fir complex and lack the apparent latitudinal clines in these characteristics found in the populations to the south. In any case, the ecological behavior of the populations from central Oregon south resembles that of California and Shasta red firs much more closely than that of noble fir. The northern limits of the range of noble fir have also been a source of confusion. Early reports placed noble fir on Mount Baker, in the Olympic Mountains, and at other locations in the northern Cascades. Subsequent investigators have not found noble fir at these Washington sites. - The native range of noble fir.",Native Range,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,11,1
"Variation in cotyledon number and seed weight (11), monoterpenes (32), and seedling characteristics has been studied in noble fir populations. Substantial variability exists in cotyledon number and seedling characteristics but does not appear to be related to latitude. Furthermore, noble fir appears discontinuous in characteristics from the fir populations south of the McKenzie River in Oregon. The southwestern Oregon populations may be a part of a strong latitudinal gradient that includes California red fir and extends south to the Sierra Nevada and California Coast Ranges.",Population Differences,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Like other true firs, noble fir is monoecious and produces female strobili high in the crown and clusters of male strobili in a zone below. Female strobili are borne singly or in groups of two, or rarely, up to five, on the upper side of 1-year-old twigs. Male strobili are borne in clusters of up to 30 or more on the undersides of branchlets. Phenological data for noble fir at three locales and over 3 years show the following ranges in timespans (12): Slightly earlier dates have been recorded for some events (6). Timing of phenological events has varied as much as 2 weeks in 3 years at the same site (12). Events are typically delayed by 1 or 2 days for each 30 m (100 ft) rise in elevation. Seven developmental stages have been identified for female strobili (12), beginning with bud swelling and ending with cone shattering. A period of early rapid growth coincides with pollen receptivity; this growth period does not appear to be as sensitive to temperature as earlier growth periods. Cone growth is generally completed by mid-August of the same year. Development of male strobili appears to be sensitive to temperature and humidity; pollen shedding requires warm, dry weather. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees may begin bearing cones at 20 years of age, although commercial seed bearing is generally considered to begin at about 50 years. Older trees can produce large quantities of seeds. The current record is an estimated 3,000 cones, potentially yielding more than 1,500,000 seeds, produced by one tree in a single year. In studies extending over the Pacific Northwest Region, noble fir produced a medium or better crop (median cone count of at least 10 cones per tree) 42 percent of the time (7,13). Cone production at particular locations was much poorer, however, especially in the high Cascades and along the eastern margin of the range of noble fir. Individual stands had intervals of as long as 6 years between medium cone crops. Seed quality is typically poor. Collections from seed traps in natural stands (equivalent to 54 seed years) had a maximum of 49 percent sound seeds; the overall average was about 10 percent. Seed quality is strongly correlated with the cone crop, which must be at least medium size before sound seeds exceed 10 percent (7). Most unsound seeds collected in seed traps consist of round but unfilled seeds, relatively small amounts being damaged by insects. Possible explanations for the poor seed quality include inadequate pollen (especially in young stands and poor seed years), poor synchrony between female receptivity and pollen shedding (12), selfing, insects, and meiotic irregularities in developing pollen. The most important factors may be similar to those suggested for Pacific silver fir (24). Firs have unspecialized pollen mechanisms, long periods of pollen dormancy, a short time after germination when pollen tubes must develop and penetrate the long nucellar tip, and archegonia that abort quickly if unfertilized. These traits, plus a low number of archegonia, may cause the low percentage of viable seeds. Noble fir seeds are not widely dispersed because of their weight, which averages 29,750 seeds per kilogram (13,500/lb) (25). Wind is the major agent of dispersal. Although the seeds can fly over 600 m (2,000 ft) (22), most actually fall within one or two tree heights of the seed trees (1). Thornburgh (29) thought that the local distributional pattern of noble fir was mainly controlled by limited seed dispersal capabilities coupled with low resistance to fire. Most noble firs in his study area were in bums that were narrow in one dimension. In one large burn that was wider than the others, noble fir grew mostly along the edges. Seedling Development- Noble fir seeds are of transient viability under natural conditions, and most germinate in the first growing season after dispersal. They remain viable for only one season in the forest floor. Germination is epigeal. Noble fir seeds germinate freely, and seedlings grow well in the open or in moderate shade on any moist humus or mineral soil. Initial development of seedlings is typically slow. Total height of 1-year-old seedlings is 2 to 5 cm (0.8 to 2.0 in), of which 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.1 in) is growth above the whorl of four to seven cotyledons. Seedlings typically require 3 to 5 years to reach a height of 0.3 m (1 ft). Seed dispersed after snow covers the ground may germinate in and on the snowbanks the next spring, with essentially no chance for survival of such germinants. Natural regeneration of noble fir appears to have variable success. In one early study, it was so rapid and abundant that it was used to support the hypothesis of reproduction from seed stored in the duff (21). Noble fir was disproportionately successful at regenerating in some small burns at high elevations, but it also failed to regenerate in one small burn where it consisted of 25 percent of the potential seed source (29). Competing vegetation may deter regeneration of noble fir on some sites (6). Little information is available on regeneration of noble fir after clearcutting. On some clearcuts, regeneration is successful; on others, it can be sparse despite an available seed source. Stocking was found to be superior to that of Douglas-fir on three of five upper-slope habitat types in the central Willamette National Forest in Oregon (28). The 15- to 17-year-old clearcuts had 282 to 1,779 noble fir seedlings per hectare (114 to 720/acre), depending on habitat type. Growth was slow; noble fir reached heights of 30 to 51 cm (12 to 20 in) at 7 years. In summary, although development of good natural noble fir regeneration is possible, it is not yet predictable. Early growth of planted seedlings is variable, depending on site conditions and stock. In one study, growth was slow; noble fir seedlings were only 8.4 cm (3.3 in) tall at the end of the first growing season in the field, half the height of Douglas-fir seedlings planted at the same time. Damage from browsing was much less on noble fir than on Douglas-fir, however. In a test of containerized noble fir seedlings, survival averaged 77 and 60 percent for containerized and bare-root stock, respectively, after 7 years. Total height after 7 years averaged 56 and 46 cm (22 and 18 in) for containerized and bare-root stock, significantly less than for Douglas-fir. Other plantings of noble fir have shown substantially better early growth than these two examples. Vegetative Reproduction- Noble fir is not known to reproduce vegetatively.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,13,1
"Outstanding growth characteristics of noble fir include its slow initial growth, sustained height growth pattern, and high form factor. Growth and Yield- Initial growth of noble fir is typically slower than that of associated species. Noble firs averaged 7.3 years to breast height (1.37 m or 4.5 ft) against 6.9 for Douglas-fir in one study (31). Significantly slower growth (for example, 11 years to breast height) is suggested by others (16,28). The height growth patterns of noble fir have been described for young stands (17,23), for British plantations (2), and for trees up to 300 years (20). Young trees on good sites are capable of height increments of nearly 1.2 m (4 ft). Height-growth curves (fig. 1) show the ability of undamaged trees to maintain height growth to very advanced ages (200 to 250 years). Maximum heights are greater than 79 m (260 ft) on the best sites, and heights at age 100 (determined at breast height) range from 18 to 49 m (60 to 160 ft). Figure 1-Height-growth patterns of natural free-grown noble fir over the general range of site qualities (adapted from 20). The largest known noble fir is 274 cm (108 in) in d.b.h., 84.7 m (278 ft) tall, and has a crown spread of 14.3 m (47 ft). Mature specimens are commonly 114 to 152 cm (45 to 60 in) in d.b.h. and 40 to 53 m (132 to 175 ft) tall. Noble fir grows most frequently in mixed stands with other species, such as Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and Pacific silver fir. It has a greater volume for a given diameter and height than any of its associates and dominates such stands, contributing volume out of proportion to the number of trees. It does grow in nearly pure stands, however, and is capable of producing high standing volumes and good growth over a wide range of ages and site qualities (7,14). Sustained height growth, high stand densities, a high form factor, and thin bark all contribute to the development of large volumes of trees and stands. Volumes of about 1400 m³/ha (100,000 fbm/acre) are indicated at culmination of mean annual increment on site class II lands (for example, site index 36 m or 119 ft at 100 years). In the grove at Goat Marsh Research Natural Area on the southwestern slopes of Mount St. Helens in Washington, the gross volume of the best contiguous 1-ha (2.47acre) block is 5752 m³/ha (82,200 ft³/acre or 407,950 fbm/acre); this value significantly exceeds the best gross volume for an acre of Douglas-fir. British yield tables for noble fir plantations indicate that yields from managed stands should also be high (2). The high form class (small amount of taper) of noble fir has been noted by many foresters and scientists (2). Culmination of mean annual increment (MAI) appears to be relatively late in normally stocked stands of noble fir. Volume and, to a lesser extent, MAI increase rapidly in stands from ages 70 to 100 years. The approximate culmination of MAI for site class 11 (site index of 36 m or 119 ft) seems to be between 115 and 130 years. Various comparisons of growth have been made between noble fir and Douglas-fir (7,17,23). Site index at 100 years for noble fir is almost always higher than for Douglas-fir on upper-slope habitat types. Despite the slower initial start, noble fir overtops the associated Douglas-firs. Yields of noble fir stands at various ages are 10 to 51 percent higher in board-foot volume and 56 to 114 percent higher in cubic-foot volume than shown in the normal yield tables for Douglas-fir stands of comparable site indexes. Rooting Habit- The main root of noble fir is slow growing, whereas lateral roots develop rapidly and have few branches (30). Root systems of typical 1- to 3-year-old seedlings do not appear fibrous, and there is no well-developed taproot. The absence of an early taproot may explain why seedlings survive only in moist soils. Little is known about the rooting habit of noble fir trees beyond the seedling stage. Noble fir appears to be at least moderately windfirm, certainly superior to western hemlock and Engelmann spruce. Reaction to Competition- Noble fir has the most intolerance for shade of American true firs. Regeneration cannot be established under a closed forest canopy. Consequently, noble fir is considered a seral or pioneer species subject to replacement by its very tolerant associates, Pacific silver fir and western hemlock. It is classed as having intermediate tolerance to shade. Overtopped noble fir saplings and poles may occasionally persist. Seedlings became established in partial shade in the Oregon Coast Ranges (8) and should, therefore, be able to establish themselves successfully under all but the densest shelterwoods. This ability, along with the heavy seed, indicates that shelterwoods or small clearcuts should be the preferred cutting method for natural regeneration of noble fir. Noble fir prunes itself well in closed stands and develops a short, rounded crown. This short crown, along with an apparent inability to form epicormic or adventitious sprouts, may be a factor in the decline and death of mature noble firs exposed to major stresses, such as along a clearcut boundary. The crown may be unable to sustain the tree when altered temperature or moisture conditions cause higher physiological demands. Damaging Agents- Insects can be common in cones and seeds. In a study of two locales in a modest seed year, 36 per cent of noble fir seeds were affected by insects (26). The fir seed chalcid (Megastigmus pinus) was found in 21 percent of the seeds; not all these seeds would necessarily have been filled, however, as the chalcid can develop in unfertilized seeds. Fir cone maggots (Earomyia barbara and E.longistylata) affected 12 percent and a cone moth (Eucosma siskiyouana) 6 percent of the seeds. Other cone insects have been identified by Scurlock (26). One of these, Dioryctria abietivorella, can mine buds, shoots, and trunks, as well as cones. Insects reported as attacking noble fir include two bark beetles (Pseudohylesinus nobilis and P. dispar (15); a weevil, Pissodes dubious, sometimes in association with the fir root bark beetle, Pseudohylesinus granulatus; and a large root aphid, Prociphilus americanus. The balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) does not infest noble fir to a significant degree (15), despite earlier reports of susceptibility (6). Adelges nusslini does infest ornamental noble firs in Canada. Mature noble firs are relatively free of serious pathogens. Gray-mold blight (Botrytis cinerea) and brown felt mold (Herpotrichia nigra) cause some damage and loss of seedlings. Numerous foliage diseases-needle cast fungi and rusts-attack noble fir, but none are considered serious threats except on Christmas trees. Butt and root rots currently known to infect noble fir are Phaeolus schweinitzii, Inonotus tomentosus, Poria subacida, and possibly Stereum chaillettii. Hepting (19) identifies no major root diseases that kill noble fir, although such pathogens may exist. Trunk rots are occasionally important, generally only in over-mature timber. The principal trunk rot is Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorium). Others include Phellinus pini, Fomes nobilissimus, F. robustus, Fomitopsis officinalis, F. pinicola, and Polyporus abietinus. Noble fir in the extreme southern part of its range is attacked by dwarf mistletoe, but this is apparently Arceuthobium tsugense and not A. abietinum (5). Mistletoe infections have been associated with extensive mortality of branches (5). Bark is occasionally stripped from the lower boles of pole-size noble firs by black bear. In one 70-year-old stand, more than half the noble firs had large basal scars from such attacks. Climatic damage to noble fir includes occasional snow breakage of tops and leaders (especially in sapling and pole-size stands) and windbreak and windthrow of mature boles. The species is very tolerant of exposed sites, such as are found along the Columbia River Gorge between Oregon and Washington.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,14,1
"Noble fir inhabits rugged, mountainous regions, so steep slopes are typical. It grows on all landforms, from valley bottom to ridgetop. Positions on a slope are perhaps most typical, although the best stands are generally on gentle topography. In the northern half of its range, noble fir shows a preference for warm, moist exposures. Noble fir can grow on a wide range of soils if ample moisture is available; water supply appears to be of more critical importance than soil quality. Spodosols and Inceptisols are most common. In one study of soils under seven upper-slope forest types, soils under noble fir stands had the smallest weight of forest floor (perhaps reflecting favorable decomposition conditions) and the highest levels of exchangeable calcium. Soils are typically developed in volcanic parent materials; volcanic tephra (ash and pumice) and colluvium, often including aerially deposited ejecta, are the most common materials. Profiles with multiple parent materials are often found because of multiple deposits of tephra. In the Coast Ranges, noble fir occurs on both volcanic and sedimentary bedrock. Noble fir is generally found at elevations between 1070 and 1680 m (3,500 and 5,500 ft) in the Cascade Range in Oregon and 910 and 1520 m (3,000 and 5,000 ft) in the Cascade Range in central Washington. In the Coast Ranges of Oregon, it generally grows above 910 m (3,000 ft). It is occasionally found at much lower elevations, however, and shows excellent growth on such sites.",Soils and Topography,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,15,1
"The wood of noble fir has always been valued over that of other true firs because of its greater strength. Loggers called it larch to avoid the prejudice against the wood of true fir; the two Larch Mountains opposite one another across the Columbia River near Portland, OR, were named for the noble fir that grows on their summits. Because of its high strength-to-weight ratio, it has been used for specialty products, such as stock for ladder rails and construction of airplanes. In 1979, noble fir constituted about 12 percent of the Christmas tree production in the Pacific Northwest and was priced (wholesale) 35 to 40 percent higher than Douglas-firs. Noble fir greenery is also in considerable demand and can provide high financial returns in young stands. Like most true firs, noble fir is an attractive tree for ornamental planting and landscaping.",Special Uses,Noble Fir,abies,procera,conifer,16,1

"Several traits related to geographic origin were identified for northern red oak in a 14-year provenance test in the North- Central States. Time of flushing is earliest for trees of northwestern origin. The trend is then eastward and southward. Autumn leaf coloration is earliest for provenances from northern latitudes and then progresses southward. Provenances from regions at the western edge of the northern red oak range, where periods of high summer temperatures and drought are common, survived better under such conditions than other provenances. Much variation in height growth was present and performance of the provenances was not consistent in all tests. The only consistent difference was the slower growth of the northern provenances in areas farther south. The within-family variation was so great it obscured any real differences in geographic origin (15).",Population Differences,Northern Red Oak,quercus,rubra,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Northern red oak is monoecious. The staminate flowers are borne in catkins that develop from leaf axils of the previous year and emerge before or at the same time as the current leaves in April or May. The pistillate flowers are solitary or occur in two- to many-flowered spikes that develop in the axils of the current year's leaves. The fruit is an acorn or nut that occurs singly or in clusters of from two to five, is partially enclosed by a scaly cup, and matures in 2 years. Northern red oak acorns are brown when mature and ripen from late August to late October, depending on geographic location (30). Seed Production and Dissemination- In forest stands northern red oak begins to bear fruit at about age 25 but usually does not produce seeds abundantly until about age 50. Good to excellent seed crops are produced at irregular intervals, usually every 2 to 5 years (30). Acorn production is highly variable among trees even in good seed years. Some trees are always poor producers while others are always good producers. Crown size seems to be the most important tree characteristic affecting acorn production. Dominant or codominant trees with large, uncrowded crowns produce more acorns than trees with small, restricted crowns (24). Even in good years only about I percent of the acorns become available for regenerating northern red oak, and as many as 500 or more acorns may be required to produce one 1-year-old seedling. Many acorns are consumed by insects, squirrels, small rodents, deer, and turkey and other birds. They can eat or damage more than 80 percent of the acorn crop in most years and virtually 100 percent of the crop in very poor seed years (19,24,28). The large acorns are generally dispersed over only short distances. Gravity and the caching activities of squirrels and mice are the primary means of dispersal. Seedling Development- Northern red oak seedlings that are established naturally or by planting at the time an old stand is clearcut, regardless of how large the clearcut area, do not grow fast enough to compete with the vigorous woody sprouts and other vegetation (4,29). The species will be present in new reproduction stands in proportion to the amount of advance reproduction present before complete overstory removal. To compete successfully in new stands, stems of northern red oak advance reproduction must be large and have well-established root systems. Thus, achieving successful northern red oak reproduction depends on creating conditions necessary for establishing seedlings and for their survival and growth (27,29). Northern red oak acorn germination is hypogeal (30). It occurs during the spring following seedfall. Best germination occurs when the acorns are in contact with or buried in mineral soil and covered by a thin layer of leaf litter. Acorns on top of the leaf litter or mixed with litter generally dry excessively during early spring and lose their viability before temperatures are favorable for germination (24,28). Although available soil moisture can be a critical factor affecting first year survival of northern red oak seedlings, it is usually adequate at the time acorns germinate. Germination is followed by vigorous and rapid taproot development, and if the taproot is able to penetrate the soil, seedlings survive considerable moisture stress later in the growing season. Northern red oak seedlings are less drought tolerant than white or black oak seedlings, however (24,31). Light intensity appears to be the most critical factor affecting not only first year survival, but also survival and growth in subsequent years (20,28). Northern red oak reaches maximum photosynthesis at about 30 percent of the light intensity in the open (21). Light intensity under forest stands is often much lower, however, at about 15 cm (6 in) above the ground, where the new seedlings are competing. Light intensity at this level under forest stands in Missouri has been documented to be 10 percent or less of that in the open, a level too low to allow seedlings to survive and grow. Once established under a forest stand, northern red oak seedlings seldom remain true seedlings for more than a few years. Conditions such as fire, poor light, poor moisture conditions, or animal activity kill the tops, but not the roots. One or more dormant buds near the root collar then produce new sprouts. This dieback and resprouting may occur several times; the result is a crooked, flat-topped, or forked stem. Such stems have root systems that may be from 10 to 15 years or more older than the tops (29). Northern red oak shoot growth is episodic. When moisture, light, and temperature conditions are favorable, multiple shoot growth flushes will occur in the same growing season. The first flush is generally the longest and each flush is followed by a distinctive rest period. Most of the annual root elongation occurs during the rest periods (22). Growth of northern red oak advance reproduction, seedlings, and sprouts is slow and generally restricted to one growth flush under undisturbed or lightly disturbed forest stands; at best it averages only a few centimeters annually (28). Vegetative Reproduction- Northern red oak sprouts readily. More than 95 percent of the northern red oaks in new production stands are sprouts, either from advance reproduction or from stumps of cut trees. New sprouts from advance reproduction arise when old stems are damaged during logging. Height growth of new sprouts is related to the size of the old, damaged stem; the larger the old stem, the faster the new sprout will grow (25,26). New sprouts grow rapidly and are usually straight and well formed. Northern red oak stumps sprout more frequently than black oak or white oak stumps but about the same as scarlet and chestnut oak stumps (27). Sprouting frequency is related to parent tree size with more small stumps sprouting than large ones. Large stumps tend to produce more sprouts than small ones but by about age 20 to 25 the number of living sprouts per stump averages four or five regardless of parent tree or stump size. Northern red oak stump sprouts grow rapidly, averaging about 61 cm (24 in) or more annually for about 30 years (14). These stump sprouts can be a valuable component of new reproduction stands particularly if they originate at or near the ground line. Sprouts of low origin are much less likely to develop decay than sprouts that originate high on the stump (24), but they tend to develop severe crook or sweep at the base. Early clump thinning may be desirable to improve potential quality although it is not needed to maintain good growth.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Northern Red Oak,quercus,rubra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Mature northern red oaks are usually from 20 to 30 m (65 to 98 ft) tall and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. in undisturbed stands on good sites. Forest-grown trees develop a tall, straight columnar bole and large crowns. Opengrown trees tend to have short boles and spreading crowns (24). Average diameter growth of northern red oak for a range of ages, sites, and stand conditions in the Central States is about 5 mm (0.2 in) annually (9). On good sites in the Appalachians, dominant and codominant northern red oaks in even-aged stands may attain average annual diameter growth rates of about 10 cm (0.4 in) and on average sites about 6 mm (0.25 in) by age 50 or 60 (32). Growing space requirements are not known for northern red oak in pure stands, but average requirements have been developed for mixed oaks in even-aged stands. Competition for growing space begins when the available space in a stand is equal to the total of the maximum requirements of all the trees in the stand. This is the lowest level of stocking for full site utilization and is about 60 percent of full stocking. The minimum growing space for a tree 15.2 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. to survive averages about 8.5 m² (92 ft². If that tree is in the open or completely free from competition, the maximum amount of growing space it can use is 14.4 m² (155 ft² . For a tree 53.3 cm (21 in) in d.b.h., minimum and maximum growing spaces are 26.5 m² (285 ft² ) and 45.7 m² (492 ft²) respectively. Experience in using the stocking standards developed by Gingrich (8) indicates that a northern red oak tree requires less growing space than trees of other oak species with the same diameter (10, 18). How much less growing space is required has not been determined, however. Yields of unthinned, 80-year-old oak stands in the Central States that contain northern red oak range from 75.6 m³/ha (5,400 fbm/acre) on site index 16.8 m (55 ft) sites (base age 50 years) to 175.0 m³/ha (12,500 fbm/acre) on site index 22.9 m (75 ft) sites. At age 70, oak stands that are first thinned at age 20 and then thinned regularly to the lowest level of stocking for full site utilization at about 10-year intervals will yield about 102.9 m³/ha (7,350 fbm/acre) on site index 16.8 m (55 ft) sites and about 278.3 m³/ha (19,880 fbm/acre) on site index 22.9 m (75 ft) sites (9). In southern Michigan, the average yields of 80-year-old unmanaged stands containing northern red oak ranged from 12.6 m³/ha (900 fbm/acre) to 3.5 m³/ha (250 fbm/acre) on poor sites and from 154.0 m³ (11,000 fbm/acre) to 280.0 m³ /ha (20,000 fbm/acre) on good sites (1). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Northern red oak is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance. It is less tolerant than some of its associates such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum), beech (Fagus grandifolia), basswood (Tilia americana), and the hickories but more tolerant than others such as yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash, and black cherry (Prunus serotina). Among the oaks, it is less shade tolerant than white and chestnut and about equal with black and scarlet (24). Northern red oak responds well to release if the released trees are in the codominant or above average intermediate crown classes (11). The best response to thinning or release is obtained if the thinning or release is made before an even-aged stand containing northern red oak is 30 years old. Trees in well-stocked stands 30 years old and older generally have small, restricted crowns and are unable to make efficient use of the growing space provided by thinning or release (24). In Arkansas, 50-year-old released crop trees averaged a 40-percent increase in diameter growth over unreleased trees in the 10 years immediately following release. Although diameter growth increased the first year after release, the greatest responses occurred in years 5-10 when growth of the released trees averaged about 0.5 cm (0.2 in) annually and was about twice that of unreleased trees (11). Epicormic branching can be prolific on northern red oak following heavy thinning in stands older than about 30 years. Trees around the perimeter of openings created by harvesting may also develop many epicormic branches, because the boles of northern red oak in fully stocked stands contain numerous dormant buds. When the boles are suddenly exposed to greatly increased light, these buds begin to grow (27). Damaging Agents- Wildfires seriously damage northern red oak by killing the cambial tissue at the base of trees, thus creating an entry point for decay-causing fungi. Wildfires can be severe enough to top kill even pole- and sawtimber-size trees. Many of the top-killed trees sprout and thus create new evenaged stands, but the economic loss of the old stand may be great (24). Small northern red oak seedlings may be killed by prescribed fires (13), but larger stems will sprout and survive, even if their tops are killed. Oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) is a potentially serious vascular disease of northern red oak and kills trees the same year they are infected. It usually kills individuals or small groups of trees in scattered locations throughout a stand but may affect areas up to several hectares in size. Oak wilt is spread from tree to tree through root grafts and over longer distances by sap-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae) and the small oak bark beetles (Pseudopityophthorus spp.) (12,23). Shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) attacks and may kill northern red oaks that have been injured or weakened by fire, lightning, drought, insects, or other diseases. Cankers caused by Strumella and Nectria species damage the bole of northern red oak and although trees are seldom killed, the infected trees are generally culls for lumber. Foliage diseases that attack northern red oak but seldom do serious damage are anthracnose (Gnomonia quercina), leaf blister (Taphrina spp.), powdery mildews (Phyllactinia corylea and Microsphaera alni), and eastern gall rust (Cronartium quercuum) (12). The carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), Columbian timber beetle (Corythylus columbianus), oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus), red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), and the twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus) are important insects that attack the bole of northern red oak. These insects tunnel into the wood, seriously degrading products cut from infested trees (3). The most destructive defoliating insect attacking northern red oak is the imported gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). This insect repeatedly defoliates trees and has killed oaks including northern red oak in a wide area in the northeastern United States. Northern red oak can recover from a single defoliation but may be weakened enough for some disease or other insects to attack and kill them. Other defoliators, that attack northern red oak are the variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), the orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), and the browntail moth (Nygmia phaeorrhoea). The Asiatic oak weevil (Cyrtepistomus castaneus) attacks northern red oak seedlings and has the potential to seriously affect seedling growth because the larvae feed on the fine roots while the adults feed on the foliage. Much damage is done to northern red oak acorns by the nut weevils (Curculio spp.), gall-forming cynipids (Callirhytis spp.), the filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus), and the acorn moth (Valentinia glandulella) (7). In years of poor acorn production, these insects can destroy the entire crop.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Northern Red Oak,quercus,rubra,hardwood,14,0
"In the north, northern red oak grows on cool moist Boralf and Orthod Spodosols. Elsewhere it grows on warm, moist soils including Udalf Alfisols, Dystrochrept and Fragiochrept Inceptisols, Udoll Mollisols, Rhodic Paleudult, Humic and Mesic Hapludult Udult Ultisols, and small areas of Udipsamment Entisols. The most widespread soils are the Udalfs and Udolls (33). These soils are derived from glacial material, residual sandstones, shale, limestone, gneisses, schists, and granites. They vary from clay to loamy sands and some have a high content of rock fragments. Northern red oak grows best on deep, welldrained loam to silty, clay loam soils (24). Although northern red oak is found in all topographic positions, it always grows best on lower and middle slopes with northerly or easterly aspects, in coves and deep ravines, and on well-drained valley floors. It grows at elevations up to 1070 m (3,500 ft) in West Virginia and up to 1680 m (5,500 ft) in the southern Appalachians (24). The most important factors determining site quality for northern red oak are depth and texture of the A soil horizon, aspect, and slope position and shape. The best sites are found on lower, concave slopes with a northerly or easterly aspect, on soils with a thick A horizon, and a loam to silt loam texture. Other factors may affect site quality in localized areas such as depth to water table in southern Michigan and annual precipitation up to 1120 mm (44 in) in northwestern West Virginia (2,24).",Soils and Topography,Northern Red Oak,quercus,rubra,hardwood,15,0

It comprises a majority of the stocking or is pure in the Northern White-Cedar forest cover type (Society of American Foresters Type 37) and is an associate species in the following types (13): 5 Balsam Fir 12 Black Spruce 13 Black Spruce-Tamarack 21 Eastern White Pine 23 Eastern Hemlock 24 Hemlock-Yellow Birch 30 Red Spruce-Yellow Birch 32 Red Spruce 33 Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 35 Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 38 Tamarack 39 Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple 108 Red Maple The northern white-cedar type commonly includes some balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and tamarack (Larix laricina) in the boreal region of Canada but tends to be mixed with additional species farther south. Balsam fir, black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), red spruce (P. rubens), tamarack, black ash (Fraxinus nigra), and red maple (Acer rubrum) are common associates on the wetter sites, especially swamps. Yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), paper birch (B. papyrifera), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), bigtooth aspen (P. grandidentata), balsam poplar (P. balsamifera), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) are common on the better drained sites, especially uplands. Except when dense, northern white-cedar stands usually have an undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Speckled alder (Alnus rugosa) is commonly the most important shrub on the better sites. Other characteristic shrubs on the better sites (especially in swamps) include mountain maple (Acer spicatum), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), and fly honeysuckle (Lonicera canadensis). On poorer sites they include Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), and wintergreen (teaberry) (Gaultheria procumbens); creeping snowberry (G. hispidula) is common on both kinds of sites (see 16 for a more complete list). Characteristic herbs on the better sites (especially in swamps) include dwarf raspberry (Rubus pubescens), false lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum canadense), woodfern (Dryopteris spp.), and bunchberry (Cornus canadensis). On poorer sites they include false Solomons-seal (Smilacina trifolia) and pitcherplant (Sarracenia purpurea). Ground cover is usually a mosaic of sphagnum (Sphagnum spp.) and other mosses, liverworts, decaying logs, and litter (13).",Associated Forest Cover,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,1,1
"Northern white-cedar grows in a relatively humid climate. Annual precipitation commonly ranges from 710 to 1170 mm (28 to 46 in), but the extremes range from about 510 mm (20 in) at the tree's northern and western limits to 1400 mm (55 in) in the southern Appalachians. One-third to one-half of the precipitation occurs during the warm season. Snowfall ranges from about 100 cm (40 in) to more than 380 cm (150 in) annually. Temperatures are often cool during a moderately short growing season. The northern limit of the range extends to the forest-tundra transition (subarctic zone) in Canada. The southern limit has an average annual temperature of less than 10° C (50° F) in the Lake States and up to 16° C (60° F) in the southern Appalachians. Average January temperatures commonly range from -12° to -4° C (10° to 24° F) and those of July from 16° to 22° C (60° to 72° F). The average frost-free period commonly ranges from about 90 to 180 days, but the extremes range from less than 80 days at the tree's northern limit to about 200 days in the southern Appalachians (16).",Climate,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,2,1

"The main range of northern white-cedar extends through the southern part of the eastern half of Canada and the adjacent northern part of the United States. Specifically, it extends westward from Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the southern part of James Bay and through central Ontario to southeastern Manitoba; then south through central Minnesota and Wisconsin to a narrow fringe around the southern tip of Lake Michigan; then east through southern Michigan, southern New York, central Vermont and New Hampshire, and Maine. The species also grows locally in northwestern Ontario, west-central Manitoba, southeastern Minnesota, southern Wisconsin, north-central Illinois, Ohio, southern New England, and in the Appalachian Mountains from western Pennsylvania south to western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. - The native range of northern white-cedar.",Native Range,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Male and female flowers of northern white-cedar, a monoecious species, are usually borne on separate twigs or branchlets; they are tiny, terminal, cone-like bodies. Male flowers are yellowish and arise from branchlets near the base of the shoot; female flowers are pinkish and appear at the tips of short terminal branchlets. Ripe cones are pale cinnamon brown, oblong, and 8 to 13 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long. In northeastern Minnesota, flower buds, which form during autumn, begin to expand the following spring from about mid-April to early May; pollen dispersal begins from late April to early June (1). In northern Michigan flowering occurs from late April to early May, pollinated conelets begin to grow rapidly in late June, cones are full grown by mid-August, and cones ripen from August to September (16,34,41). The period between cone ripening and cone opening is only from 7 to 10 days. Seed Production and Dissemination- Cone production has been induced within 3 months of seed germination using gibberellic acid and a long photoperiod (18). Under normal conditions cones have been found on northern white-cedars as young as 6 years old (9). Seed production in large quantities begins when the trees are about 30 years old but is best after 75 years. An average-sized tree with a fairly full crown can produce about 9 liters (0.25 bu) of cones (16), yielding 60,000 to 260,000 cleaned seeds. Limited data from Michigan indicate that white-cedar trees on upland sites produce more cones per tree, more seeds per cone, and a higher percentage of full seeds than those on swamp sites (6). Rangewide, northern white-cedar generally bears good or better seed crops at intervals of 2 to 5 years. However, during a 26-year period (1949-74) in northeastern Wisconsin, such crops were produced every 1 to 3 years, with medium crops to failures in the intervening years. In addition, it was found that good or better white-cedar seed crops can be predicted by similar-sized crops in red maple the preceding spring (20). Seed dispersal usually begins in September, although it sometimes begins as early as August. In the northern Lake States cones open from mid-September to late October (1,41). Most of the seeds are released by November, but some seeds continue to fall throughout the winter. Northern white-cedar seeds are light chestnut brown, about 6 mm (0.25 in) long, and have lateral wings about as wide as the body; cleaned seeds average 763,000/kg (346,000/lb) (41). Most seed is wind disseminated, with the seeding range estimated to be from 45 to 60 m (150 to 200 ft) under normal conditions (16). Seedling Development- Northern white-cedar seeds remain viable for 5 years or more when stored in sealed containers at 6 to 8 percent moisture content and 0° to 3° C (32° to 38° F). As a rule the seeds have only slight internal dormancy. Under forest conditions dormancy is broken while the seeds lie on the ground during the first winter; thus fall sowing is generally recommended (41). Because white-cedar seeds apparently do not remain viable in the forest floor longer than 1 year, such seeds should not be relied on for reproduction after clearcutting or fire (6,17). Germination is epigeal, with the cotyledons rising above the ground. The seed seems to germinate best at high temperatures such as 29° C (84° F) (19), so that even though germination normally begins in May or June of the year following seed dispersal, it sometimes does not occur until late July or early August. Alternating day and night temperatures of 30° and 20° C (86° and 68° F), respectively, are recommended for germination tests (41). Northern white-cedar seeds germinate readily on a variety of moist substrates, but seedlings become established on only a few. The main requirements for early development seem to be a constant moisture supply and warm temperatures (10,19). Although white-cedar generally grows best on neutral or slightly alkaline soil, seedlings do best on neutral or slightly acid soil but will grow on slightly alkaline soil (16). On cutover white-cedar swamps in Minnesota, seedlings were found only where the pH of the surface soil (upper 10 cm or 4 in) ranged from 6.6 to 7.2 (36). On undisturbed areas, seedbeds of decaying (rotten) wood of logs and stumps account for more than 70 percent of the seedlings (10,25). These seedbeds usually are more moist, warmer, and have less litter than other seedbed types (19); they are also commonly dominated by mosses such as Heterophyllium, Pleurozium, and Brotherella (25). Some seedlings become established-but usually much less frequently-on decayed litter, peat or humus, and sphagnum moss. On disturbed areas, northern white-cedar seedlings commonly prosper on both upland and swamp burns. Broadcast burning (or wildfire) apparently must be fairly severe, however, to expose favorable, mineral soil seedbeds on uplands or to improve moss seedbeds in swamps (27,48). White-cedar seedlings also reproduce well on skid roads where the compacted moss stays moist (16). A heavy cover of slash hinders seedling establishment, but a light cover is more favorable than none (27,48). Northern white-cedar seedlings generally grow slowly under both forest and nursery conditions. Annual height growth averages only about 8 cm (3 in) during the first several years; seedlings can grow this much in 140 days under long photoperiods in growth chambers (18). Stock raised in a nutrient solution and hardened in a nursery was superior to 3-year-old (2-1) nursery transplants (49). In upland plantings transplants averaged 0.9 m (2.9 ft) tall at 9 years of age in the northern Lake States and 2.6 m (8.5 ft) tall at 12 years in Illinois (26,29). Although moisture is often the most important factor during the first few years, ample light is needed for continued seedling development. Seedlings were tallest when grown in about half of full light, but their shoots and roots were heaviest in full light (31). In areas with frequent hot, dry spells, partial overstory shade is necessary to reduce losses from drought and herbaceous competition (19). Both shoot and radial growth generally begin in May and end by late August or in September in the northern Lake States and New Brunswick (1,16). Mortality of northern white-cedar seedlings during their early years is extremely high. Drought is probably the most important cause; seedlings on substrates such as thick moss, stumps, and hummocks often dry out during the summer. Other causes of early loss or damage include smothering by sphagnum moss or logging slash, cutting or girdling by small rodents such as the red-backed vole, and deer browsing (especially on planted stock) (9,16,26,49). Vegetative Reproduction- Northern white-cedar can send out roots from any part of a branch or stem if moisture conditions are favorable. Thus it frequently reproduces vegetatively in swamps, especially on poor sites with abundant sphagnum moss. If young seedlings are not considered, many more stems probably originate vegetatively than from seed in most swamps because vegetative reproduction is more tolerant of shade and is never without an adequate root system (9). Layering generally accounts for more than half the stems of white-cedar reproduction in northern Michigan and Maine swamps. It is most common in young stands and those with leaning trees, where the lower branches become covered by moss. Seedlings may produce layerings by age 5 or before (16,34). New trees also develop vegetatively from uprooted trees whose vertical branches form roots. Sprouts from roots or stumps are generally rare (16). Cuttings are commonly used to propagate cultivars of northern white-cedar; under forest conditions branchlets may be rooted by setting them out in deep sphagnum moss (9).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Northern white-cedar is a medium-sized tree, commonly 12 to 15 m (40 to 50 ft) tall and 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h. at maturity. Infrequently it reaches 21 to 24 m (70 to 80 ft) tall and 120 to 150 cm (48 to 60 in) in d.b.h. (10). Maximum dimensions reported are more than 30 m (100 ft) in height and 180 cm (72 in) in d.b.h. White-cedar reaches a maximum age of 400 years or more in swamps or on other lowland sites (16). The growth rate of northern white-cedar is greatly affected by site productivity and is expressed as site index or the height of dominants at age 50 years. In the Lake States, site index ranges from about 12 m (40 ft) on the best sites to 5 m (15 ft) on the poorest (27). Indications are that the site productivity of white-cedar swamps could be increased substantially by drainage (44). Northern white-cedar generally grows more slowly and attains less height than associated trees, especially in swamps. Information on yield of northern white-cedar is limited mainly to normal yield tables for pure, fully stocked, even-aged stands in the Lakes States. Such stands have yields at 120 years as shown in table 1 (27). Northern white-cedar reaches a maximum basal area of about 69 m²/ha (300 ft²/acre) (8). Unfortunately for its value as timber, the tree commonly has a curved butt and poor form, especially in swamps (9). Little is known about biomass production, although components of various-sized white-cedars have been analyzed for weight (and nutrient elements) (12). Above-ground biomass in one 70- to 100-year-old white-cedar stand totaled 159 t/ha (71 tons/acre) and had a net annual productivity of about 10 t/ha (4.5 tons/acre) (38). Timber rotations for northern white-cedar differ greatly with site productivity and management objective. Rotations for maximizing merchantable cubic volume range from 70 to 90 years for a site index of 12 m (40 ft) and from 80 to 100 years for an index of 9 m (30 ft). Rotations for sawtimber range from 110 to 140 years for a site index of 12 m (40 ft) and from 130 to 160 years for an index of 9 m (30 ft) (27). Rooting Habit- Northern white-cedar seedlings grown in different soil media have shown that as moisture-holding capacity increases, root form changes from a long taproot with few laterals to shorter, thicker roots with many laterals. Root extension is particularly pronounced in rotten wood (9). In Wisconsin, seedlings grown from seed collected in upland stands developed deep root systems in well-drained soils and shallow root systems in saturated soils; their lowland counterparts showed little plasticity in root development (33). After the seedling stage northern white-cedar generally develops a shallow, wide-spreading root system; and natural root grafts are fairly common. Because the tree grows on rocky cliffs throughout its range, the root system is apparently well adapted to secure water and nutrients from cracks in rocks (10). Reaction to Competition- Northern white-cedar is classed as shade tolerant, but it has been placed in three classes: very tolerant, tolerant, and intermediate. This variation probably exists because vegetative reproduction is considered more tolerant than seedlings (9). Northern white-cedar is less tolerant than balsam fir but slightly more tolerant than black spruce. White-cedar can withstand severe suppression for several years, and it responds well to release not only during the reproduction period but at nearly all ages (3,16). Response to thinning northern white-cedar depends upon site quality, residual stand density, and stand age. In a well-drained Michigan swamp, a 45-year-old stand with a residual basal area of 15.8 m²/ha (69 ft²/acre) more than doubled its basal area in 8 years following thinning; a similar thinning in a poorly drained swamp showed no beneficial effect (16). In a 65-year-old stand on a medium swamp site in Wisconsin, basal area growth following a second thinning was independent of stand density over a wide range. The growth rate decreased following the second thinning, however, probably because of increasing stand age (14). Both even-aged and uneven-aged stands of northern white-cedar are common. Even-aged stands develop in large swamp openings following wildfire or clearcutting (13). In Wisconsin white-cedar often invades speckled alder thickets that form in swamps following wildfire or changes in water level; and it can reproduce directly on burned peat (10). Even-aged stands also develop on abandoned upland fields in Maine (and southeastern Canada)- but apparently only where competition is not severe (9). Uneven-aged white-cedar stands are generally associated with the late stages of succession and are found mainly in swamps or on other moist sites (23). They develop where white-cedar reproduces in small openings created by partial cutting or wind damage, especially on poor sites where reproduction is mainly of vegetative origin. Uneven-aged stands also develop where white-cedar gradually succeeds associates- such as balsam poplar, tamarack, and black spruce- that are not as shade tolerant or long-lived (13). However, understory white-cedars sometimes are not much younger than the overstory species; in such cases what appears to have developed through succession may really be due to suppression (23). Without major disturbance such as fire, the northern white-cedar type is exceedingly stable because the tree is long-lived and balsam fir is the only important associate sufficiently shade tolerant to grow in dense white-cedar stands (10). Many stands, however, have been either opened by timber harvesting or severely browsed by white-tailed deer. In both cases, succession is often to balsam fir or swamp hardwoods, especially black ash (27). In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, northern white-cedar reproduction was most abundant after clearcutting in small blocks and narrow strips, and it should grow best after such cutting because hardwood competition is less than after partial cutting (3). Shelterwood cutting is preferred, however, for the last blocks or strips to ensure adequate natural seeding (27). This method of cutting also provides the partial overstory shade necessary to reproduce white-cedar in areas with frequent hot, dry spells (19). Successful deeryard management requires reproducing large, even-aged stands of white-cedar (47). Because deeryard management and timber management are usually inseparable in the white-cedar type, the general recommendation is to produce large patches- 16 to 65 ha (40 to 160 acres)- by harvesting small blocks annually (48), using clearcutting or shelterwood cutting as indicated above. Satisfactory reestablishment of white-cedar after clearcutting, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, particularly broadcast burning of slash (48). Where winter deer densities are high, the entire patch must be completely cleared in 10 years or less to minimize overbrowsing (27); but where they are low, small blocks or narrow strips may be clearcut at 30-year intervals (42). Damaging Agents- On wet sites such as swamps, restricted soil aeration resulting from abnormally high water levels usually reduces the growth rate of northern white-cedar and may kill entire stands. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding. Road-caused flooding has killed white-cedar or reduced its growth on thousands of hectares in northern Minnesota (45); natural gas and petroleum pipelines will probably have similar effects unless cross drainage is provided (4). Wind-induced uprooting and breakage sometimes occur in older stands on both upland and swamp sites, especially along exposed edges and in stands opened by partial cutting (27). Large trees and those with basal defect are most susceptible to wind damage. Northern white-cedar is highly susceptible to fire damage because its bark is thin and has a high oil content; its shallow roots are easily damaged even by light ground fires (6). On the Laurentian Shield in northeastern Minnesota, this species has been driven to the lakeshores by fire (23). The risk of wildfire is low, however, on most white-cedar areas in the United States and good fire protection now results in little loss (27). Snow and ice often damage northern white-cedar by breaking limbs (6); they also break stems or force trees into a permanent leaning position (7,9). Agents that turn northern white-cedar foliage yellow or brown and sometimes cause severe damage or death include unfavorable winter weather, deicing salts, and drought. Plantings are particularly susceptible to winterkill caused by dehydration (40). The tree's tolerance of deicing salts is only moderate or intermediate (15,46); so branches exposed to salt spray along highways commonly have severe dieback. In Iowa windbreaks, white-cedar had more drought damage than other evergreens during a very dry winter (37). When the oldest foliage turns rusty red in the fall, however, it is a natural shedding of branchlets (cladoptosis) (39). Northern white-cedar is relatively free from serious insect injury (9,39). Carpenter ants and leafminers are probably its principal insect pests. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) commonly reduces the timber value of large trees and often makes them subject to windbreakage. The red carpenter ant (C. ferrugineus) has caused significant damage in Minnesota (2). Leafminers are common pests of northern white-cedar. They have caused severe ""scorching"" of foliage and often subsequent twig, branch, or tree mortality in southeastern Canada (39). Outbreaks of the arborvitae leafminer (Argyresthia thuiella) have severely damaged white-cedar stands in Maine, and damage to ornamentals and nursery seedlings is often severe. Ornamental white-cedars are also subject to serious injury by another leafminer, Coleotechnites thujaella (2). Several other insects and related organisms (such as mites) feed on northern white-cedar, but only a few are important. The bagworm (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis), juniper scale (Carulaspis juniperi), and spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis) can significantly damage ornamental white-cedars (39,50). Heavy infestations of the Fletcher scale (Lecanium fletcheri), arborvitae aphid (Cinara tujafilina), and arborvitae weevil (Phyllobius intrusus) have occurred in nurseries (2). Northern white-cedar has few serious diseases as a forest tree, especially in immature stands; whereas in cultivation it is subject to several seedling and foliage diseases. Seedlings seem to be resistant to damping-off fungi, however. The foliage-blight fungi Phomopsis juniperovora and Didymascella thujina are among the main organisms causing seedling diseases. Beyond the seedling stage Phomopsis juniperovora blights foliage and shoots under humid conditions, and Didymascella thujina causes some unsightliness. In Quebec a snow-blight fungus (Phacidium sp.) has caused important damage in nurseries and hedges (24). Although several root- and butt-rot fungi attack northern white-cedar, they mainly attack old or damaged trees. Because fruiting bodies of these fungi seldom appear on living trees, the most common outward sign of rot is woodpecker holes. Poria subacida, causing a white stringy butt rot, and balsam (or brown) butt rot (Tyromyces balsameus) and red-brown butt rot (Phaeolus schweinitzii), both causing cubical rots, are common in trees on knolls or other drier parts of swamps (16). Balsam butt rot can also cause extensive root rot in suppressed white-cedars (24). Winter browsing by white-tailed deer often severely damages older seedling- and sapling-stage northern white-cedar in the Lake States and can prevent the satisfactory reestablishment of the type after harvesting (27), especially in deeryards. In some areas, however, damage from snowshoe hares is as great as, or greater than, from deer (16). Porcupines sometimes kill white-cedar trees or lower their growth and timber quality by feeding heavily on foliage and by girdling stems and branches. Red squirrels frequently clip branchlets with flower buds and cone clusters, and thus may significantly reduce the supply of seed available for reproduction (6). Both porcupine and squirrel damage contribute to the prevalence of stag-headedness in old trees (9).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,14,1
"Northern white-cedar grows on a wide variety of organic soils (Histosols) and mineral soils (especially Inceptisols and Entisols); however, it does not develop well on extremely wet or extremely dry sites. It is most often associated with cool, moist, nutrient-rich sites, particularly on organic soils near streams or other drainage-ways, or on calcareous mineral soils. In Minnesota, however, white-cedar stands on uplands are primarily determined by an interaction of vegetation and lack of disturbance (21). Northern white-cedar commonly grows on soils ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.2 (9,36). Northern white-cedar is usually dominant in rich swamps (forested rich fens) that have a strong flow of moderately mineral-rich soil water. The organic soil (peat) is usually moderately to well decomposed, 0.3 to 1.8 m (1 to 6 ft) thick, and often contains much rotted wood. It can also dominate the peat ridges in bog and fen complexes that have a sluggish movement of weakly enriched water (22). On mineral soil (upland) sites northern white-cedar is characteristic of seepage areas, limestone uplands, and old fields. It is common on shallow loam over broken limestone in southeastern Ontario and often forms pure stands in old fields and pastures on moist, well-drained soils in Maine (9), southern Quebec, and southeastern Ontario. The tree also grows on calcareous clays, limestone cliffs, outcrops of acidic trap rock, and sandstone bluffs (10,29). Northern white-cedar generally grows best on limestone-derived soils that are neutral or slightly alkaline and moist but well drained. Nevertheless, most commercial stands are in swamps, where northern white-cedar can compete well with its associates (13) and is normally protected from fire (23). Although old-field soils differ greatly, the tree's form and volume growth are much better on old fields than in poorly drained swamps (9). Northern white-cedar grows from near sea level to more than 600 m (2,000 ft), but within most of its range it is found between 150 and 600 m (500 and 2,000 ft).",Soils and Topography,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,15,1
"The principal commercial uses of northern white-cedar are for rustic fencing and posts; other important products include cabin logs, lumber, poles, and shingles. Smaller amounts are used for paneling, piling, lagging, pails, potato barrels, tubs, ties, boats (especially canoes), tanks, novelties, and woodenware (28). Recently, white-cedar has been used for making kraft pulp and it appears excellent for particleboard. ""Cedar leaf oil"" is distilled from boughs and used in medicines and perfumes; boughs are also used in floral arrangements (32). The northern white-cedar type is valuable for wildlife habitat, particularly for deeryards during severe winters. The tree is highly preferred by white-tailed deer for both shelter and browse. Sapling stands produce a great amount of deer food (47) and clearcut stands in Michigan yielded almost 6000 kg/ha (5,340 lb/acre) of browse from tops (16). White-cedar is also utilized by such mammals as the snowshoe hare, porcupine, and red squirrel. Its browse is generally rated as highly preferred by hares (5,30) and is sometimes heavily utilized (6). Birds common in white-cedar stands during the summer include several warblers (northern parula, black-throated green, blackburnian, black-and-white, and magnolia), white-throated sparrows, and kinglets (9,11). The pileated woodpecker commonly excavates cavities in mature white-cedars to feed upon carpenter ants. Northern white-cedar forms an attractive fringe around some lakes and peatlands. Stands with high basal area, large trees, and little undergrowth are especially attractive (35). The tree's unusual bark and foliage patterns are esthetically appealing to many forest users (27). Northern white-cedar is widely used for ornamental plantings in the United States (24), is now common in Newfoundland, and has been grown in Europe since the 16th century. White-cedar is particularly useful for barrier and shelter plantings (29), and it is one of the few conifers recommended for power line rights-of-way (43). Northern white-cedar has limited value as a watershed protector because it usually grows on gently sloping terrain. Although harvesting of white-cedar is presently on a small scale, clearcutting on peatland sites has little effect on annual water yields or water tables. Nutrient concentrations in streamflow or temperatures in trout streams should not increase significantly unless harvesting is on a massive scale (27,35).",Special Uses,Northern White-Cedar,thuja,occidentalis,conifer,16,1

"Nutmeg hickory is scattered in a few areas in eastern South Carolina, central Alabama and Mississippi, northern Louisiana, southern Arkansas, eastern Texas, and northern Mexico. The species is abundant only near Selma, AL, and in southern Arkansas. Nutmeg hickory has a native range nearly identical with that of Durand oak (Q. durandii var. durandii). Both may be relics of a more ancient flora than now occupies the region (5). -The native range of nutmeg hickory. Precipitation within the range of nutmeg hickory varies from 1020 to 1400 mm (40 to 55 in) per year, 510 mm (20 in) or more falling during the growing season. The frost-free period of most of the native range is about 240 days. Summers are warm and dry in the western portion of the range, but warm and wet in the South Carolina disjuncts. July temperatures average about 27° C (80° F). January temperatures average between 7° and 10° C (45° and 50° F). Extremes of temperature are -23° to 43° C (-10° to 110° F). Nutmeg hickory grows on a variety of loamy, silty, or clayey soils that may be described as moist, but well or moderately well drained and amply supplied with mineral nutrients. The species most often is found in minor stream bottoms, on second bottom flats, and on slopes or bluffs near streams. The principal soils on which nutmeg hickory is generally found are in the orders Alfisols and Inceptisols. Nutmeg hickory is not an important species in any forest cover type and is only a minor associate in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 91) (3). Other prominent associates in this type include white ash (Fraxinus americana); shagbark, shellbark, mockernut, and bitternut hickories (Carya ovata, C. laciniosa, C. tomentosa, C. cordiformis); Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii); and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Less important associates are willow, water, and Durand oaks (Q. phellos, Q. nigra, and Q. durandii); American and winged elms (Ulmus americana, U. alata); yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera); and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Some common small trees and shrubs occurring with nutmeg hickory are eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya uirginiana), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia).

"Flowering and Fruiting- The species is monoecious and forms imperfect flowers. Both male and female flowers are found on the current year's growth. The male flowers are long-stalked catkins, developing at the shoot base (7). The female flowers are in short spikes on peduncles at the end of the shoot. Flowering occurs from April to May, shortly after the leaves have started to open. Specifies of pollen production, dissemination and pollination are not known. The sweet, edible nut matures from September to October of the same year and falls between September and December. Its ellipsoidal shell is thick and hard. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production starts when the trees are about 30 years old, and optimum seed-bearing age is 50 to 125 years (5). Good seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years. As many as 70 liters (2 bu) can be produced by an open-grown tree. Seeds are disseminated by various methods, including squirrels and water. Seedling Development- The seeds of this species germinate from late April to early June. Germination is hypogeal. Burial of seeds by squirrels seems to be important, but it is not necessary for the successful establishment of seedlings. Vegetative Reproduction- Specific information on the vegetative reproduction of nutmeg hickory is not available. Like other hickories, it probably sprouts readily from small stumps, injured or top-killed seedlings and saplings, and from roots (2). Large stumps do not readily sprout, hence the larger the stump, the more likely that it will reproduce only by root suckers. Growth and Yield- Nutmeg hickory is a medium-sized tree with a tall, straight trunk and stout, slightly spreading branches that form a narrow and rather open crown. It can attain heights of 24 to 30 in (80 to 100 ft) and a diameter of 61 cm (24 in). Although the pecan hickories (which include nutmeg hickory) grow more rapidly than the true hickories (6), specific information on the growth rate of nutmeg hickory is lacking. The pecan hickories, in turn, grow more slowly than most other bottom-land hardwoods. The average 10-year diameter increase for hickories in natural, unmanaged stands in the northeast Louisiana delta was 4.3 cm (1.7 in) in the 15- to 30-cm (6- to 12-in) diameter class; 3.3 cm (1.3 in) in the 33- to 48-cm (13- to 19-in) diameter class; and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in the 51- to 71-cm (20- to 28-in) diameter class (5). Pure stands of nutmeg hickory probably do not exist, and no volume figures are available. Logs and lumber from merchantable nutmeg hickory are sold mixed with other hickories. Rooting Habit- Nutmeg hickory has a strongly developed taproot, especially on well-drained soil. Seedlings of hickory quickly develop a heavy taproot and fine lateral roots. During the pole stage, a robust, spreading lateral root system is developed. Reaction to Competition- Nutmeg hickory is classed as intolerant of shade. It is intolerant as a mature tree, but tolerant in the seedling and sapling stage during which it may survive for a long time in the understory and then respond to release (5). Any partial cutting system that removes larger, faster-growing competition encourages nutmeg hickory. Damaging Agents- Fire damages hickory of all ages. A light burn kills the tops of seedlings and saplings; a more intense fire wounds larger trees and provides entry for butt-rotting fungi. Several insects attack hickory but rarely become epidemic (1). The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), walnut caterpillar (Datana integerima), and walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata) may defoliate individual trees or limbs. Sucking insects, including aphids (Monellia spp.), feed on the underside of leaves, causing them to curl and drop prematurely. The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) may seriously prune seedlings and even large trees by girdling the terminal and branches. The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) can be troublesome during dry years and periods of stress. The ambrosia beetle (Platypus spp. and Xyleborus spp.) and powderpost beetles (Lyctus spp. and Xylobiops basilaris) often cause economic damage to logs and lumber during storage and air-drying. No important diseases of hickory other than a number of wood rots have been reported. Bird peck defect, caused by the yellow-bellied sapsucker, is common and serious in nutmeg hickory.",Life History,Nutmeg Hickory,carya,myristicformis,hardwood,10,0
"The nuts of nutmeg hickory are relished by squirrels, which begin cutting them while they are still green (4). Other rodents and wildlife also eat the nuts. The species is too rare over most of its range to be of major economic importance. The wood of this pecan hickory is slightly inferior in strength and toughness to that of the true or upland hickories, but owing to the small volumes involved and difficulty of distinguishing it from the true hickories, nutmeg hickory is not separated from them during logging.",Special Uses,Nutmeg Hickory,carya,myristicformis,hardwood,16,0
"Nuttall oak is a chief component of the forest cover type Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 92) (8).

North in the Mississippi Valley, it is found in Arkansas, southeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Missouri, and western Tennessee, it develops best on the alluvial bottom lands of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. -The native range nuttall oak.",Native Range,Nuttall Oak,quercus,nutallii,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Nuttall oak is monoecious. The male and female flowers appear in March and April at the time of leaf flushing. The male flower appears 10 to 14 days before the female flower. Male flowers are borne in clustered, yellowish-green catkins. Inconspicuous female flowers are borne in the axils of the new leaves and are found only by close examination. The flowers are wind pollinated. The acorns ripen from September to October of the second year and fall between September and February. Seed Production and Dissemination- Young trees about 20 years old produced good seed crops for several years at Stoneville, MS; this is probably the age at which optimum seed-bearing begins. In the TVA arboretum at Norris, TN, 5-year-old trees bore acorns. There are generally good seed crops every 3 or 4 years, and the average tree yields 6 to 35 kg (13 to 77 lb) of clean nuts in 9 to 53 liters (0.25 to 1.5 bushels). The nuts average 209/kg (95/lb) (27). Water, rodents, and birds disseminate the seed. Seedling Development- Nuttall oak seeds require 60 to 90 days cold stratification. They overwinter and germinate in the spring when soil temperatures are 21° to 32° C (70° to 90° F) (27). Seed germination percentages average 60 to 90 percent but germination varies by size and may be reduced by acorn weevil damage. Larger acorns had somewhat higher germination rates than smaller ones. The percent of germination was unaffected even when seeds were submerged in water for as long as 34 days (5). Germination is hypogeal (27). The best natural seedbed for most Nuttall oaks is a moist soil, covered with an inch or more of soil or leaf litter with partial shade (12). Although rodents, turkeys, deer, and hogs eat many of the seeds, natural reproduction in the bottom lands is usually abundant. Seedlings are often killed by high water during the growing season, but seedling survival, date of budbreak, or height growth are not significantly affected. When grown in saturated soil for 16 weeks in winter and spring (3), Nuttall oak seedlings become established both in the open or in shade, and can survive 5 to 10 years in the shade (15). Strong tap roots are developed (13). Mycorrhizal roots were common on seedlings growing in green-tree reservoir plots (9). Vegetative Reproduction- Methods for propagating Nuttall oak from cuttings or by grafting have not been developed. When attempted, air-layering has not been successful (2). Stumps of small trees sprout readily, but those of older trees do not.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Nuttall Oak,quercus,nutallii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Nuttall oak grows rapidly with a 5-year average of 4.08 m (13.4 ft) height growth and 0.006 m³ (0.2 ft³ increase in stem volume (17,18,19). Second-growth trees reach a merchantable size, 60 cm. (24 in) in d.b.h. in about 70 years. Trees 30 to 37 in (100 to 120 ft) tall and 90 cm (36 in) and larger in d.b.h. are common in old stands, but even trees of good quality degenerate rapidly soon after they mature. A 10 cm (4 in) diameter growth in 10 years is common but 20 cm (8 in) is possible. By impounding winter and spring rainfall, radial tree growth was increased by about 38 percent as compared to that of untreated trees (6). On poor sites the wood of this oak is knotty, and insect damage and mineral stain are severe. Several successive years of drought and channelization of waterways may lower the water table on what normally would be good Nuttall oak sites and cause trees of all ages to die (24). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Nuttall oak is classed as intolerant of shade; seedlings survive and grow rapidly only in openings. The tree is almost always dominant or codominant (13,14,16). Damaging Agents- Acorn weevils (Curculio spp.) can reduce acorn germination by causing damage to developing acorns. The carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robinise) causes heavy damage to Nuttall oak. Other borers that cause timber defects are the red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), the white oak borer (Goes tigrinus), others of the genus Goes, the oak sapling borer (G. tesselatus), and the hardwood stump borer (Stenodontes dasytomus). The clearwing borer (Paranthrene simulans) creates an entry point for rot and stain fungi, causing additional defects. Estimated loss from borer defects in oak lumber is approximately $40 million per year (25). Other borers infect twigs, branches and roots, reducing growth and vigor, but do no damage to the merchantable parts of the tree. A serious insect-caused defect in Nuttall oak lumber is bark pocket caused by the sap-feeding beetles (nitidulids) incombination with the carpenterworm and several other borers (22). Periodic outbreaks of defoliating insects such as basswood leafminer (Baliosus nervosus) and pink striped oakworm (Anisota virginiensis) retard growth rates of oaks over large geographical areas (26). Nuttall oak is subject to attack by three important canker rot fungi. All enter the trunk through dead branch stubs by germination of airborne spores. The cambium is killed, rough cankers are induced around the entry point, and the heartwood is decayed. The resulting cankers are called hispidus, spiculosa, or Irpex, depending on the causal fungi-Polyporus hispidus, Poria spiculosa, and Spongipellis pachyodon respectively (21). Nuttall oak growing north of 35° latitude may be killed by oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum). Daily temperatures above 30° C (86° F) reduce development of the disease (20). Anthracnose (Gnomonia quercina) and Actinopelte leaf spot (Actinopelte dryina) cause defoliation in some years (26).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Nuttall Oak,quercus,nutallii,hardwood,14,0
"Nuttall oak grows well on heavy, poorly drained, alluvial clay soils in the first bottoms of the Mississippi Delta region (17,24), performing best on soils with a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 (1,7). It is common on clay ridges but is not found in permanent swamps or on well-drained loam. Typically, it grows on clay flats that are normally covered with 8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) of water throughout the winter. The tree is less common on clay or silty clay flats and sloughs on the terrace of major streams. In the Coastal Plain, Nuttall oak grows mostly in alluvial river bottoms on sites similar to those described for the Delta (24).

It grows naturally from the borders of South Carolina near the coast through the Ogeechee Valley in Georgia to Clay County in northern Florida and Washington County in western Florida (4). It is found in abundance along the Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Suwannee Rivers (2), and in certain wet flatwood regions between the Choctawhatchee and Wakulla Rivers of Florida (5). In its Florida range it is less than 1 percentof the woody plant population. -The native range of Ogeechee tupelo.",Native Range,Ogeechee Tupelo,nyssa,ogeche,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The species is polygamo-dioecious, bearing perfect and pistillate flowers on female trees and only staminate flowers on male trees. The flowers appear from late March to early May after the new leaves are fully grown (5). The minute flowers, originating in the axils of bud scales, are greenish yellow and inconspicuous with rounded to oblong petals. Pistillate flowers are solitary on short, 1.6 mm (0.06 in) woody peduncles with a deep cup-shaped woolly calyx. The style is stout, exserted (extending beyond the petals), and reflexed from near the base; remnants of it persist on the mature fruit. The male flowers occur in clusters on slender hair peduncles 1.3 mm (0.5 in) long. The filaments are inserted under the margin of a thick disk and bear oval, roughened anthers (4). The male flowers, in particular, produce an abundance of nectar. Bees are extremely active in the trees during the flowering period and probably are responsible for pollen dissemination. The fruit is an edible, oblong-shaped red drupe, 3 to 4 cm (1.0 to 1.5 in) long, containing an acid flesh. Each drupe contains one, rarely two, 3 cm (I in) long seed with a papery, pale seedcoat. Ogeechee tupelo has the largest fruit in the genus. It matures in July and August but persists until November and December after the leaves have fallen (4). Seed Production and Dissemination- The species is a prolific and fairly consistent producer of blossoms and fruit, although a freeze after the flowers have opened may cause an occasional failure. Little is known about the age or size at which trees begin to bear seed. Seedlings planted on a lake shore in Florida grew to a height of almost 2.4 m (8 ft) in 3 years and matured a good crop of fruit at that time. The fruit falls to the ground and into the water beneath the parent tree, and most seed dissemination is undoubtedly quite local. Birds and small animals may carry seed some distance, however. Some seed is waterborne, as drifts of the fruit may be found at previous high waterlines following floods. Fresh, undamaged fruit and the seeds from it usually sink in water (5). Fruit and seeds that have dried a little will float. Cleaned seed range from 2,290 to 3,130/kg (1,040 to 1,420/lb), averaging 2,710/kg (1,230/lb). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (6). Data on the establishment and early growth of Ogeechee tupelo are lacking. Where the surface soil becomes very dry, the newly germinated seedlings generally do not survive. In a dense grass sod, the young trees may survive but grow very slowly. Under favorable conditions seedlings have attained a height of 0.6 cm (2 ft) or more during the first growing season. One group of about 200 seedlings left in nursery rows along a lake shore in north Florida averaged 1.2 to 1.8 in (4 to 6 ft) in height after 2 years. Vegetative Reproduction- Much reproduction occurs as sprouts from stumps or root crowns. Stream edges may be quite densely covered with Ogeechee tupelo that has reproduced almost exclusively by this means. There is no recorded information about propagation by cuttings.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Ogeechee Tupelo,nyssa,ogeche,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- While Ogeechee tupelo may mature as a shrub only a few feet tall or as a 19.8 in (65 ft) tree, it is most frequently a small, crooked, deliquescent tree 7.6 to 10.7 in (25 to 35 ft) tall (3,5) with a narrow, round-topped crown (4). Its height seldom exceeds 15.2 in (50 ft). Individual stems may have diameters of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) (3) but they are usually not more than 38 cm (15 in) (5). The bark is 3.2 mm (0.125 in) thick, irregularly fissured, with a dark-brown surface broken into persistent platelike scales (4). The trees are probably short lived, although reliable information is lacking. When the original stems weaken or die, sprouts develop from their root crowns. These evidently produce a vigorous root system of their own, thus prolonging the life of the individual tree for a considerable time and resulting in the thicketlike growth frequently seen.

"Ogeechee tupelo is limited to alluvial soils along the rivers and in river swamps. A permanently wet site is apparently requisite for satisfactory regeneration and growth. It grows successfully on soils that are flooded for long periods; however, there must be at least a slight movement of the water. Ogeechee tupelo is most commonly found growing on soils of the order Inceptisols. Where waters back up and stand for long periods after the main flood has subsided, as in second bottoms, Ogeechee tupelo is usually a tall, deliquescent shrub or a dwarfed tree. It seldom attains tree form very far from natural stream channels. Generally it grows best and is most abundant at an elevation of only a few centimeters above the average water level and is infrequently found more than 0.3 to 0.6 m (1 to 2 ft) above the average water level of the streams along which it grows.",Soils and Topography,Ogeechee Tupelo,nyssa,ogeche,hardwood,15,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowering generally peaks in spring or summer after vegetative flushing, but some varieties or populations peak in fall or winter. Individual trees or branches may produce flowers at any time during the year. The red, salmon, pink, or yellow perfect flowers are arranged in a dense terminal cymose corymb. The stamens are long and numerous and the flowers are quite showy. Endemic Hawaiian birds (Drepanididae) and insects are the most important pollinators of 'ohi'a lehua. The inflorescence normally has 18 to 24 flowers in different developmental stages. Fruit maturation takes 4 to 12 months (15). Seed Production and Dissemination- Little is known about the age at which the trees begin to bear seeds or the number of seeds produced. Many small lightweight seeds may be produced per capsule, but many of these are infertile (9). Seed germination is best with newly produced seeds and varies from less than 1 to 78 percent (6). In a nonrandom sample of 142 trees more than 90 percent had germination rates less than 35 percent. In one study, maximum germination of 'ohi'a lehua seed was obtained at 25° C (77° F) and 4 to 15 percent full sunlight (2). Seeds remain viable for as long as 9 months if stored at room temperature (5). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Many seeds germinate on downed or upright treeferns and downed moss-covered trees. More than 70 percent of the seedlings in the rain forest habitat grow on these substrates. In one 'ohi'a-treefern community a late summer peak in the appearance of 'ohi'a lehua germinants has been documented (2). Seedling growth rates are relatively slow. In one study, seedling height growth averaged less than 10 cm (4 in) per year. Survival and growth of seedlings established in shade reached a maximum at less than full sunlight after varying degrees of canopy removal (2). Vegetative Reproduction- 'Ohi'a lehua often reproduces vegetatively from stem sprouts on fallen trees. The stem sprouts can produce adventitious roots and eventually become independent. Stem sprouts on a standing weakened or dying tree may outlive the parent tree and grow to maturity. Planting stock can be produced from at least 60 percent of new-growth cuttings within about 6 months compared with up to a year to produce seedlings (4).",Reproduction and Early Growth,'Ohi'a lehua,metrosideros,polymorpha,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- 'Ohi'a lehua is a relatively slow-growing tree. In one study (unpublished), saplings and mature trees in stands rated as commercial 'ohi'a lehua forest had a mean annual d.b.h. increment of 0.25 cm (0.10 in). On good sites, 'ohi'a lehua commonly grows to 20 m (65 ft) and 45 cm (18 in) in diameter. Trees 30 m (100 ft) tall exceeding 120 cm (48 in) in diameter have been found. 'Ohi'a lehua grows in both pure and mixed stands. Stand basal area can exceed 40 m²/ha (175 ft²/acre) in pure stands on good sites. Pure stands probably are the result of disturbance. Rooting Habit- No quantitative studies are available concerning the rooting habit of 'ohi'a lehua. Most roots apparently are near the surface. On deep soil and broken lava some deep woody roots may be formed. Reaction to Competition- Shade tolerance of 'ohi'a lehua ranges from intolerant to intermediate, depending on varietal differences (3,13). A pioneer species on young volcanic substrates (17), 'ohi'a lehua retains dominance on some relatively old soils. Acacia koa is its primary competitor for canopy dominance in wet forests. Cibotium spp. (treeferns) may displace 'ohi'a lehua on those sites with optimal conditions for treefern growth (2,13). Damaging Agents- Many insects attack 'ohi'a lehua trees. Among these, the endemic cerambycid borer Plagithmysus bilineatus has the greatest potential impact. It may become epidemic and fatal to weakened trees and is associated with extensive canopy dieback. Environmental stresses are significant in reducing 'ohi'a lehua vigor and predisposing the trees to attack by R bilineatus (14). Other potentially damaging borers are Ceresium Unicolor, Xyleborus saxesensi, and X. simillimus. Defoliators and sapsucking insects also cause minor injury to 'ohi'a lehua. The root rots, Phytophthora cinnamomi (14) and Pythium vexans, and the shoestring root rot, Armillaria mellea, can be locally damaging and also are associated with canopy dieback. Damping off caused by Rhizoctonia spp. also has been reported (6). Decline of 'ohi'a lehua canopy has been the subject of considerable research since 1975 showing that the phenomenon is most likely characteristic of the species. The loss of ability to withstand environmental stresses, diseases, or insect attacks is apparently synchronous among trees within populations. Entire stands of approximately equal age trees may die back to a few remanents (1,10,11).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,'Ohi'a lehua,metrosideros,polymorpha,hardwood,14,0

"Ohio buckeye grows mostly on mesophytic sites in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and southern Michigan west to Illinois and central Iowa. Its range extends south to eastern Kansas, southwestern Oklahoma, and central Texas; east to western Arkansas, Tennessee, and central Alabama with one location in eastern Mississippi (9). It has been planted in Europe and the eastern United States; in eastern Massachusetts, Minnesota, and western Kansas (11). - The native range of Ohio buckeye. The average annual temperature in the growing area of Ohio buckeye ranges from about 4° to 10° C (40° to 50° F) (6). Average minimum temperatures are not below -29° C (-20° F) within its range, but -40° C (-40° F) temperatures have been recorded where it grows in Missouri and Iowa. Maximum temperatures as high as 46° C (115° F) have occurred in the western part of its range. Average annual precipitation ranges from 760 mm (30 in) in Kansas and Oklahoma to 1020 mm (40 in) in Ohio and western Pennsylvania, and up to 1400 mm (55 in) in Mississippi and Alabama. Growing-season precipitation averages 510 to 640 mm (20 to 25 in). Snowfall ranges from 5 cm (2 in) in the southern part of the geographic distribution to 102 cm (40 in) in the northern part. About 160 days are frost-free in the northern part of the range and as many as 220 days in the southern part. The buckeye is a moist-site tree and is most frequently found along river bottoms and in streambank soils. It is often found on the moist soils of the Early Wisconsin Drift Plain in Indiana (4). Ohio buckeye is most commonly found growing on soils of the order Alfisols. In the early 1800's buckeye and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) were prominent on the slope phase of the Miami silty clay loam in Ohio (9). Buckeye made up about 5 percent of the forest stand on this soil type. Since then its abundance has diminished. Although Ohio buckeye is sometimes found on drier sites such as those supporting oak-hickory stands, and on clayey soils, it usually grows slowly in these situations and seldom becomes dominant. It is a shrub, only 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) tall, on dry habitats in the oak-hickory association of eastern Oklahoma (9). Ohio buckeye also is found in hardwood stands on moist sites in the limestone-sink-and-cave section of the Bluegrass region of Kentucky and is infrequently found on the well developed flood plains along the Missouri River in southeastern Nebraska (9). Ohio buckeye grows in mixed stands with bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), chinkapin oak (Q. muehlenbergii), white ash (Fraxinus americana), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), sugar maple, black walnut (Juglans nigra), black cherry (Prunus serotina), honeylocust (Gleditsia triancanthos), Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), American elm (Ulmus americana), and red mulberry (Morus rubra) in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky (9). In Indiana, 6 percent of the trees in a mixed hardwood stand were buckeyes; 39, 11, 16, and 28 percent were sugar maple, American elm, black walnut, and miscellaneous species, respectively. In another stand in which more than 50 percent of the trees were beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple, hackberry, and black walnut, buckeye constituted a little more than 10 percent. In the mixed mesophytic climax forests of Marion and Johnston Counties, IN, in 1819, Ohio buckeye made up 6 and 2 percent, respectively, of the total number of stems (9), and less than 2 percent of these trees were more than 46 cm (18 in) in d.b.h. In a few stands, however, it made up as much as 17 percent of the total stems, ranking second in importance only to beech. Buckeye is a frequent or even a common tree in association with beech, sugar maple, and American basswood (Tilia americana) in the Wabash River Basin in southern Illinois and Indiana (9). Ohio buckeye is not listed by the Society of American Foresters as a major or minor component of any of the North American forest cover types (5), probably because of its relatively minor commercial importance and its increasing rarity. It is not a pioneer tree and thus is seldom found on old fields or spoil-bank sites.",Habitat,Ohio Buckeye,aesculus,glabra,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Ohio buckeye is polygamo-monoecious, bearing both bisexual and male flowers. The pale greenish-yellow flowers appear after the leaves in the spring from March to May and are borne in upright branched clusters. Only those near the base of the branches of a cluster are perfect and fertile; the others are staminate (4,11). The fruit is a leathery capsule containing one, two, or three seeds. The ripe seed is dark chocolate to chestnut brown, smooth and shiny, with a large, light-colored hilum so that it resembles an eye. 'The cotyledons are very thick and fleshy and contain no endosperm. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are dispersed from early September to late October by gravity, by animal activity, and sometimes by water. The number of hulled seeds per kilogram ranges from 105 to 150 (48 to 67/lb), and most seeds are sound (11). The seeds have a high moisture content and should be kept moist to avoid loss of viability. Ohio buckeye begins bearing seeds at 8 years but no data are available on frequency and amount of seed produced (11). Seedling Development- The seeds ordinarily germinate in the spring after wintering on the ground. Germination is hypogeal. If seeds are to be sown in a nursery, they should be sown in the fall or stratified about 120 days before spring sowing (11). No germination has been observed on dry surface soil, even with an ample seed supply. Seedlings can grow under some shade, but the species seems to develop best as isolated individuals in openings along streambanks and on other moist sites. No data are available on early growth rates. Vegetative Reproduction- No information available. Growth and Yield- Ohio buckeye generally develops a strong taproot the first year. Most of the shoot growth occurs early in the growing season. As a sapling it grows faster than most of the oaks but slower than yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). In the open, it is characteristically branchy with a short, knotty trunk. Fifty Ohio buckeyes measured in Jefferson County, IN, averaged 20.7 m (68 ft) in height and 84 cm (33 in) in d.b.h., 91 cm (36 in) above the ground (9). Apparently these trees were larger in diameter than average for buckeye, even though the diameter was measured lower on the bole than the standard breast height of 1.37 m (4.5 ft). This species generally does not grow taller than 9.1 m (30 ft) and seldom exceeds 21.3 m (70 ft) (9). In 1978, the largest living tree registered was 116 cm (45.5 in) in d.b.h., 44.5 m (146 ft) tall, and had a crown spread of 16.5 m (54 ft) (1). Trees larger than 61 cm (24 in) in diameter are rare. On good sites, the tree will reach usable sawtimber size at 60 to 80 years of age. On poor sites, it seldom has the form or size to produce saw logs. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Because Ohio buck-eye is often found in beech-sugar maple stands, it must be classed as shade tolerant. It only attains good form as a timber tree when it grows in reasonably dense stands. Side competition and shade foster straight boles and encourage natural pruning of this tree, which tends to have a large, branchy crown. Damaging Agents- Ohio buckeye is relatively free of insect pests but the sapwood timberworm (Hylecoetus lugubris), the lacebug (Corythucha aesculi), the chrysomelid (Derocrepis aesculi), and the walnut scale (Quadraspidiotus juglansregiae) feed on buckeye (2). Ohio buckeye also has relatively few diseases (6). It is susceptible to a leaf blotch (Guignardia aesculi), which begins as brown spots or blotches on the leaves and may eventually involve all the leaves, giving the tree a scorched appearance. This disease may slow the growth rate but does no permanent damage to the tree and can be controlled on ornamentals. One of the powdery mildews, Uncincula flexuosa, also attacks the leaves of buckeye. A leaf rust of the Ohio buckeye that occurs in the western part of the species range was long known as Aecidium aesculi but has now been established by Baxter as Puccinia andropogonis (3). Leaf blotch and leaf scorch, the latter involving a physiogenic response to heat and drought along urban streets, may be the most serious diseases (7). Air pollution may be more responsible for the leaf blighting than heat or drought. Because Ohio buckeye leafs out early in the spring, the young leaves are sometimes killed by frost. This species is capable of withstanding severe winters, however and has been successfully introduced in Minnesota and Massachusetts. Moreover, the bole of the tree is not commonly damaged by frost, and the heavy branches of the crown are seldom severely damaged by heavy loads of sleet or snow. Apparently buckeye is not susceptible to sunscald either. The common eastern leafy mistletoe, Phoradendron serotinum, occurs on Ohio buckeye, but damage is negligible (7). Fungi capable of causing either rot of the central stem or rot at wounds of living trees include Ganoderma applanatum, Oxyporus populinus, Phellinus johnsonianus, and Polyporus squamosus (7). Buckeye growing in forest stands is usually free of defect caused by decay unless the bole has been damaged by fire.",Life History,Ohio Buckeye,aesculus,glabra,hardwood,10,0
"The seeds as well as the bark of Ohio buckeye are reported to be poisonous, and the Aesculus native to Illinois is known to contain a poisonous narcotic glucoside (9). The young shoots of buckeye are poisonous to cattle, and landowners in Indiana have exterminated buckeye in many areas because the seed is considered poisonous to livestock (9). On the other hand, some buckeye seed are apparently eaten by squirrels. In Ohio, it constitutes from 2 to 5 percent of the food of eastern fox squirrels during the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Other studies in Ohio list buckeye as an auxiliary food that was sampled by squirrels in September but not eaten in quantity (9). Thus, it seems probable that the use of buckeye seed for food by animals is not a limiting factor in its reproduction. Fox squirrels in Illinois were observed eating the pith from terminal twigs (6). Buckeye pith contains 66 percent raffinose, a sweet-tasting 18-carbon sugar that is much sweeter and contains potentially more energy than sucrose. The wood is light and soft and is used for pulpwood, woodenware, and occasionally for lumber(10).",Special Uses,Ohio Buckeye,aesculus,glabra,hardwood,16,0
"In the northern part of its range, Oregon ash is occasionally found in small pure stands, but it is usually associated with other trees, such as red alder (Alnus rubra), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), Oregon white oak Quercus garryana), and various willows (Salix spp.) (2,3,8,22). In its drier habitats, it also grows with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and grand fir (Abies grandis) (2,6,22). Associated species in southwestern Oregon and northern California are California-laurel (Umbellularia californica), white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), California sycamore (Platanus racemosa), California black oak Quercus kelloggii), Oregon white oak, and ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) and Digger pines (P. sabiniana) (8,22). Oregon ash is an associate in the following forest cover types, Red Alder (Society of American Foresters Type 221), Black Cottonwood-Willow (Type 222), Port Orford-Cedar (Type 231), and Oregon White Oak (Type 233). Understories in the riparian communities of western Oregon valleys vary from almost nothing under dense stands or in areas with recent silt deposits to herbaceous-typically sedges-or dense shrubby types (3,4).",Associated Forest Cover,Oregon Ash,fraxinus,latifolia,hardwood,1,0
"In the northern part of its range, Oregon ash grows where summers are generally cool and humid and winters are usually mild (22). Mean annual temperatures are 8° to 9° C (46° to 48° F), and temperatures are usually not extreme. Precipitation ranges from 1500 to 3000 mm (59 to 118 in) annually and is generally well distributed from fall through spring. July and August are often rainless. In the valleys of western Oregon, mean annual temperatures are 11° to 12° C (52° to 54° F), and annual precipitation averages 510 to 1020 mm (20 to 40 in) (3). In the southern part of its range, Oregon ash grows where summer temperatures are high and precipitation is low; humidity varies from high to low, depending on proximity to the Pacific Ocean (22).",Climate,Oregon Ash,fraxinus,latifolia,hardwood,2,0

"Oregon ash is found from northern Washington to southern California. Some trees found growing wild in southwestern British Columbia are thought to have come from seed disseminated by planted ornamentals (14). In Washington, Oregon ash grows along the shores of Puget Sound, in the western Cascade Range, and along the southwestern coast, but not in the Olympic Mountains (22). It grows along the Columbia River from the coast east to The Dalles in Oregon (22). In western Oregon, it occurs from the coast into the western Cascades and is prominent in the valleys-particularly the Willamette Valley (2). More than 2.5 million m³ (90 million ft³) of growing stock occur in Oregon and Washington (12). In California, Oregon ash is found in the north Coast Ranges as far south as Santa Clara County (10). It also grows in the Sierra Nevada and in the delta region of the Great Valley. The species is prevalent in the canyons of the Pit and Sacramento Rivers (7). -The native range of Oregon ash.",Native Range,Oregon Ash,fraxinus,latifolia,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Oregon ash is dioecious; its small greenish flowers appear in dense, glabrous panicles with the leaves in April or May (8,25). The fruits, oblong to elliptical samaras, ripen in August or September. They are 3 to 5 cm. (1.25 to 2 in) long and 3 to 9 mm (0.1 to 0.33 in) wide, including the wing, and are light brown when mature (10, 18). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are produced about the 30th year (2). Oregon ash is an abundant annual seeder in open stands or as isolated trees (22), but heavy crops occur at 3- to 5-year intervals in forest stands (2). Seeds are dispersed by wind in September or October. There are usually 22,000 to 31,000 cleaned seeds per kilogram (10,000 to 14,000/lb) (25). Most seeds of ash have dormant embryos and require cool, moist stratification to germinate (25). They have medium to high germination and persistent viability. Germination is best and seedlings are most abundant on moist or wet soils rich in organic matter. Germination is scanty in sandy or gravelly stream bottoms where seeds are carried away by floods (22). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Seedlings grow in height rapidly in rich soils and slowly in poor soils (22). They are somewhat tolerant of shade when quite young (16). Growth is rapidly checked by drought, but seedlings survive drought well (21). Vegetative Reproduction- Sprouts from stumps are common and vigorous (2,10,21).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Oregon Ash,fraxinus,latifolia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Oregon ash has moderately rapid growth for 60 to 100 years and attains a height of 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) and a d.b.h. of 40 to 75 cm (16 to 30 in) in 100 to 150 years on good sites (16,22). Individuals may grow twice as large and reach 200 to 250 years of age under favorable conditions, although they generally grow slowly after their first hundred years (22). The largest known specimen is 18 m (59 ft) tall and 668 cm (263 in) in circumference (15). In drier parts of its range and at higher elevations, Oregon ash is often smaller than 8 m (25 ft) tall and 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) in d.b.h. (22). Rooting Habit- The root system is moderately shallow but very fibrous and wide spreading (2,21). The trees are windfirm (2,8,21). Reaction to Competition- The species is classed as intermediate in tolerance of shade (1). Individuals self-prune quickly with side shade, and forest-grown trees have long, clean trunks and narrow, short crowns with small branches (22). Overtopped trees respond well to release (16). Open-grown trees on moist sites have short trunks and wide, round-topped crowns with large limbs (22). Oregon ash is often a small, crooked tree on dry sites or at high elevations (22). Damaging Agents- Oregon ash is attacked by a variety of insects (5). Thysanocnemis spp. are small weevils that can destroy 60 percent of a seed crop. They are found throughout the range of the species. Various insects that cause foliage or twig damage harmful to ornamentals but are not considered forest pests are: Arizona ash lace bug (Leptoypha minor), plant bug (Tropidosteptes pacificus), snowy tree cricket (Oecanthus fultoni), and the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea). The Oregon ash bark beetle (Leperisinus oregonus) causes no economic damage but is often abundant in cordwood. Fungi occurring on Oregon ash that cause leaf spot are Mycosphaerella effigurata, Cylindrosporium fraxini or Marssonina fraxini, Piggotia fraxini, Mycosphaerella fraxinicola, Phyllosticta innumera, and Cylindrosporium californicum (9,24). Common powdery mildew (Phyllactinia guttata) is found on Oregon ash (9,19). Twig fungi that occur are Hysterographium fraxini, Cytospora ambiens, and Nectria cinnabarina (9,19,24). The true mistletoe Phoradendron longispicum is found on Oregon ash. The heart rot Perenniporia fraxinophilus attacks older trees and may cause extensive cull (9,19).

"Although Oregon ash is sometimes found growing as high as 1520 m (5,000 ft) in elevation, it usually does not occur higher than 910 m (3,000 ft) (6). Its preferred habitat is poorly drained, moist bottom land with deep soil rich in humus (fig. 2). In the central Willamette Valley of western Oregon, it is most commonly found on sites with silty clay loams and clays (4). The species also grows in sandy soils or moist, rocky, gravelly soils (2,22). It often follows streams and swamps in ribbonlike fringes (2) and is characteristic in seasonally flooded habitats (3). Oregon ash is also found on adjacent forest sites at higher elevations, in old fields, and along roads (2).

"The most notable use of Oregon ash is for fuel; it splits easily and has high heat value. The symmetrical shape, rapid growth rate, and hardiness of Oregon ash have resulted in its being planted as an ornamental tree and a street tree in cities within its native range, in the Eastern United States, in southwestern British Columbia, and in Europe. It is found in botanical gardens of western and central Europe (18).

"Oregon white oak is found in pure, closed-canopy stands; in mixture with conifers or broad-leaved trees; and as scattered single trees or groves on farmlands, woodlands, and prairies. It grows to large sizes but is also found extensively as scrub forest. The best stands are in western Oregon and Washington-in the Cowlitz, Lewis, and Willamette River drainages-but stands or trees with substantial volume are found from British Columbia to central California. Dense dwarf or shrub stands of Oregon white oak, earlier identified as Quercus garryana var. breweri, and other stands previously identified as Q. garryana var. semota, form dense thickets over large areas in California (29,35,57,76,81). Similar dwarf or shrub forms grow to a more limited extent on severe sites in the rest of its range (57,79). Oregon white oak is recognized as a distinct forest cover type (Society of American Foresters Type 233) and is listed as an associated species in at least eight other forest cover types (20): Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Port Orford-Cedar (Type 231), Redwood (Type 232), Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234), Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245), California Black Oak (Type 246), Knobcone Pine (Type 248), and Blue Oak-Digger Pine (Type 250). Its prominence and occurrence in these types, as well as in several others for which it is not specifically listed, vary widely. Plant communities have been identified in parts of the Oregon white oak type. A Garry oak community of two types (oak parkland and scrub oak-rock outcrop), a Garry oak-arbutus, and an arbutus-Garry oak community have been defined in the Victoria, BC, metropolitan area (42). Four communities, ranked in order from wettest to driest, have been identified in white oak forests of the Willamette Valley: Oregon white oak/California hazel/western swordfern, Oregon white oak/sweet cherry/common snowberry, Oregon white oak/Saskatoon serviceberry/common snowberry, and Oregon white oak/Pacific poison-oak (73). These communities are floristically similar, being differentiated primarily by the relative coverage and frequency of a few shrub species. Five Oregon white oak communities identified in the North Umpqua Valley of Oregon were similar to the xeric Oregon white oak/Pacific poison-oak association of the Willamette Valley; a sixth was a riparian association dominated by Oregon white oak and Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia) (62). In California, four communities dominated by Oregon white oak were found in the Bald Hills woodlands of Redwood National Park (70) and three communities dominated by Oregon white oak or related hybrids were identified in a limited area on Bennett Mountain (75). The shin oak brush association, largely composed of Oregon white oak, is a distinctive plant community in Kern and Los Angeles Counties (76). The composition of Oregon white oak communities varies greatly because of differences in soil, topography, and climate, and in fire and grazing histories. Because of proximity to farmlands, many communities include introduced forbs and grasses. Pacific poison-oak (Rhus diuersiloba) and common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) are probably the most widespread and characteristic shrub associates. Species often found with Oregon white oak are listed in table 1. The listing is not exhaustive; it just indicates the great variety of common associates. Species associated with Oregon white oak in chaparral communities and on serpentine soils are listed in other sources (15,16,79).",Associated Forest Cover,Oregon White Oak,quercus,garryana,hardwood,1,0
"Oregon white oak grows in diverse climates, ranging from the cool, humid conditions near the coast to the hot, dry environments in inland valleys and foothill woodlands. Records from 48 climatic observation stations within or bordering its range indicate that Oregon white oak has endured temperature extremes of -34° to 47° C (-30° to 116° F) (45,47,53,77). Average annual temperatures range from 8° to 18° C (46° to 64° F); average temperatures in January, from -11° to 10° C (13° to 50° F); and in July, from 16° to 29° C (60° to 84° F).

"Though Oregon white oak populations in Washington are disjunct and scattered, the chemical and morphological characteristics of their foliage are similar (71). Genetic differences appear so minor that seed distribution from a common source by Indians has been postulated. Ecotypic variation was observed in top and root growth of young seedlings from seed collections made from Corvallis, OR, southward (43). First-year seedlings from northern sources were taller and heavier. Quercus garryana hybridizes naturally with four other oaks. Quercus x subconvexa Tucker (Q. durata x garryana), a small tree found in Santa Clara and Marin Counties, CA, is noteworthy because of its morphologically dissimilar parents-Q. garryana is a deciduous tree, Q. durata an evergreen shrub, and the hybrid is tardily deciduous (74). Quercus x howellii Tucker (Q. dumosa x garryana) is also a small tree found in Marin County and a hybrid between a deciduous tree and an evergreen or tardily deciduous shrub or tree.

"The range of Oregon white oak spans more than 15° of latitude from just below the 50th parallel on Vancouver Island in Canada south nearly to latitude 34° N. in Los Angeles County, CA. South of Courtenay, BC, Oregon white oak is common in the eastern and southernmost parts of Vancouver Island and on adjacent smaller islands from near sea level up to 200 m (660 ft) or more (47). It is not found on the British Columbia mainland except for two disjunct stands in the Fraser River Valley (28). In Washington, it is abundant on islands in Puget Sound and distributed east and west of the Sound and then south and east to the Columbia River at elevations up to 1160 m (3,800 ft) (68). Oregon white oak is widespread at lower elevations in most of the Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue River Valleys of western Oregon (67,68). It is also common in the Klamath Mountains and on inland slopes of the northern Coast Ranges in California to San Francisco Bay but infrequent from there southward to Santa Clara County (29). In small tree and shrub sizes, Oregon white oak extends inland to just east of the Cascade Range, mainly in the Columbia River and Pit River drainages (29,50,67,68,71). It has a scattered distribution the entire length of the western Sierra Nevada south to the Tehachapi Mountains in Kern and northern Los Angeles Counties where it forms extensive brush fields at elevations up to 2290 m (7,500 ft) (29,76). -The native range of Oregon white oak.",Native Range,Oregon White Oak,quercus,garryana,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Oregon white oak flowers somewhat later in the spring than many of its associates. Flowering has been noted in March, April, May, and June (72,74), but the seasonal span is probably greater over the wide range of latitudes and elevations where this species occurs. Flowers appear concurrently with new leaves and extension of twig growth. The species is monoecious, bearing slim, staminate flowers (catkins) that emerge from buds on existing twigs and also appear on the basal end of developing twigs (64). Some catkins associated with new twig growth just originate from the same bud; others are located as much as 5 mm (0.2 in) from the base on new growth. Catkins are pale yellow tinged with green. Fully extended catkins vary greatly in length-in one collection, from 3 to 10 cm (1.2 to 3.9 in). Catkins of the same twig and cluster are in various stages of development-some are fading before others reach full size. The faded dry catkin is light brown and fragile. The closed pistillate flowers are small, deep red, and covered with whitish hairs (64). They appear in axils of developing leaves, either single and sessile or as many as five or six on a short stalk up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long. Two flowers are often located at the base of the stalk and several along and at its tip. Basal flowers may be open while others on the stalk are still tiny and tightly closed. Flower openings are narrow; the interior elements are greenish to yellowish. Flowers were found on new growth that had extended only 1 cm (0.4 in) or up to 12 cm (4.7 in); most flowers were on new growth 4 to 7 cm (1.6 to 2.8 in) long. Flowering appears at its fullest when the first leaves are about half size; when leaves approach full size, catkins are withered. On a single tree, flowering seems to be a short event, perhaps a week long, as leaves develop quickly once growth starts. Individual trees are known to flower abundantly, but observations are needed on the regularity of flowering and on the variability within and between stands and locations. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed crops may be heavy but are considered irregular. The large acorns, typically about 3 em (1.2 in) long and half as wide, mature in one season and ripen from late August to November. The age when a tree first bears fruit, the age of maximum production, and the average quantity produced have not been determined. In one collecting effort, about 18 kg (40 lb) of acorns per hour could be hand-picked from the ground under woodland trees between Redding and Weaverville, CA. The yield was estimated to be 5 to 9 kg (10 to 20 lb) each for trees 3 to 9 in (10 to 30 ft) tall and 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) in diameter; production for this fair crop was about 560 kg/ha (500 lb/acre) (81). Northeast of Mount Shasta, a fair crop the same year yielded about 23 kg (50 lb) of acorns from a single tree 8 in (25 ft) in height and crown spread. In the Willamette Valley, acorns were dispersed from September to November, and three crops ranged from failure to 1737 kg/ha (1,550 lb/acre) ovendry-weight basis (12). Large crops of acorns are also produced by shrubby forms of Oregon white oak, but density of the stands can make collection difficult. The heavy seeds disseminate by gravity only short distances from the tree crowns, except on steep slopes. Local transport is attributed primarily to the food-gathering activities of animals. In the past, Indians-and also pigeons-may have been responsible for long-distance colonization of Oregon white oak (28,71). Seedling Development- Acorns of Oregon white oak must be kept moist until they germinate. In nature, moisture is maintained by a layer of leaves or through shallow insertion into soil from impact, rodent activity, animal trampling, or other soil disturbances. A moisture content of 30 percent or more must be maintained in cool regulated storage to maintain seed viability. Storage conditions have not been determined specifically for Oregon white oak; several methods recommended for keeping seeds moist should be suitable (46,65). The acorns are large and heavy, averaging about 5 g each (85/lb). Viability has been better than 75 percent in the few samples tested (46), but the usual quality of the seeds is unknown. The seeds are not dormant; they will germinate soon after dispersal if subjected to warm, moist conditions. They will also germinate prematurely in low-temperature stratification. Normally, seeds retain viability only until the next growing season; chances of extending the viability period have not been determined. Seedlings of Oregon white oak generally appear in the spring. Germination is hypogeal, and the rapid development of a deep taproot is believed responsible for their ability to establish in grass. Shoot development is relatively slow but can be greatly accelerated with long photoperiods (43). Seedlings are not produced now for forest plantings, but raising them in containers is readily possible. Direct seeding of acorns should also prove successful if seeds and young seedlings are protected from rodents and other predators. In at least some circumstances, natural reproduction from seed seems to occur readily (13,28,35). Vegetative Reproduction- Oregon white oak sprouts abundantly from dormant buds on cut stumps, root collars, and along exposed trunks. Sprouts provide the most certain way to obtain natural regeneration. In 3 years, stump sprouts in 49 clumps in northwestern California averaged 10 per clump; height of the tallest sprout averaged 2.8 in (9.2 ft) and crown diameter per clump 2.5 in (8.2 ft) (52). Larger stumps produced more sprouts, larger clumps, and faster growing shoots. The spread of Oregon white oak by root sprouts has been noted in widely separated instances (28,68,69,70,71,74). In general, the rooting or layering of oak cuttings is difficult, and there is no reason to believe that Oregon white oak would be easier to reproduce by these methods than other oaks.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Oregon White Oak,quercus,garryana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Under favorable conditions, mature Oregon white oak trees are 15 to 27 in (50 to 90 ft) tall and 60 to 100 cm (24 to 40 in) in d.b.h. (34,48,72,73). A maximum height of 36.6 m (120 ft), crown spread of 38.4 in (126 ft), and diameter of 246 cm (97 in) at d.b.h. are on record (2,35). Typically, open-grown trees have short holes bearing very large, crooked branches that form dense, rounded crowns (fig. 3). Such trees occupy much space but do not produce much volume for commercial use, except for fuel. In contrast, forest-grown trees 70 to 90 years old have slim, straight holes, fine side branches, and narrow crowns (60). Trees measured in northwestern California had average form classes of 63 and 68 (34). Branchwood of trees over 60 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. averaged 24 percent of total cubic volume. Trees of better form are probably developing now because young stands are more even aged and better stocked than those in the past, but such stands are limited in extent and widely scattered. Resource inventories of various intensities indicate that the Oregon white oak type occurs on at least 361 400 ha (893,000 acres) in California, Oregon, and Washington and, as a species, comprises 26.2 million in' (926 million ft') or more of growing stock (7,8,9,10,21,25,26,27). As a component of woodland and other vegetation types, Oregon white oak is found on an additional 299 100 ha (739,000 acres) in California and in sizeable, undefined areas in Oregon and Washington. In California, the mean stand growing-stock volume in the type was 76.9 m³/ha (1,099 ft³/acre), and the maximum found was 314.7 m³/ha (4,498 ft³/acre). Oregon white oak generally grows slowly in both height and diameter, but there are exceptions. Limited data from widely separated locations indicate that six to eight rings per centimeter (16 to 20/in) is a common rate for slower growing Oregon white oaks (28,68,72,75). For example, trees in a full stand 47 to 70 years old on deep Willakenzie soil at Corvallis, OR, averaged 14 in (46 ft) in height, 15 cm (6.0 in) in d.b.h., and eight rings per centimeter (20/in) in radial growth (38). Oregon white oak has the capability, however, of growing faster than five rings per centimeter (13/in) (31,48,72,80). In the Cowlitz River Valley, the fastest rate shown on large stumps was 1.9/cm (4.9/in); in the Willamette Valley, the rate averaged 4.6/cm (11.8/in) for four forest-grown trees 95 to 135 years old that averaged 24 in (80 ft) tall and 48 cm (19 in) in d.b.h. Basal area of Oregon white oak stands has ranged from 8.0 to 60.8 m² /ha (35 to 265 ft²/acre), with up to 19.3 m²/ha (84 ft²/acre) additional basal area of other species present. In these and other stands averaging 10 cm (4 in) or more in d.b.h., number of oak stems ranged from 10 to 2,800/ha (4 to 1,133/acre) (1,4,31, 62,69,70,72,75). Volumes for stands on different sites and of different ages are not known. One 80-year-old stand that averaged 160 trees 9 cm (3.6 in) and larger in d.b.h. would yield about 94.5 m³/ha (15 cords/acre) (60). Rooting Habit- Oregon white oak has a deep taproot and a well-developed lateral system; it is very windfirm even in wet areas. Fast taproot extension and sparse development of laterals are shown by seedlings in the first few weeks of growth. Despite formation of a deep taproot, a high percentage of oak roots are found in upper soil layers. Only 11 percent of the total number of oak roots were found below 76 cm (30 in) in deep Willakenzie soil (38). In contrast, 28 percent of the total Douglas-fir roots in the same soil were found below 76 cm (30 in). Reaction to Competition- Oregon white oak has been classed as intermediate in tolerance, intolerant, and very intolerant of shade (47). Perhaps such a range of tolerance best describes its status in different situations. Clearly, it is not tolerant of over-topping by Douglas-fir and associated conifers. Dead oaks often found beneath Douglas-fir canopies bear witness that they could not endure the shade (40,72). In some locations and situations, Oregon white oak perpetuates itself, indicating that it can reproduce adequately in its own shade. Branch development on open-grown trees may be very dense. Sparse development of side branches in closed stands provides evidence, however, that it should be classed as intolerant of shade. Oregon white oak functions as both a seral and a climax species. It is long lived, reproduces from both seeds and sprouts, forms nearly pure stands, and can endure great adversities. In fact, it rates as a climax species because it has greater ability than other species to establish itself and persist where yearly or seasonal precipitation is sparse, where soils are shallow or droughty, or where fire is a repeated natural occurrence. Geologic and floristic evidence indicates that Oregon white oak associations have evolved through successive eras as components of relatively and pine-oak forests, have repeatedly advanced northward from a locus in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, and have repeatedly retreated as North American climates warmed and cooled (16). The most recent northward advance ended about 6,000 years ago; the more and vegetation types, including oak woodlands, are now being replaced by conifer forest favored by the climatic trend toward cooler and moister conditions. The seral role of Oregon white oak is illustrated by major changes occurring in the Willamette Valley. Open oak woodlands, savannas dotted with oaks, and grasslands were prominent and widespread before the territory was settled; fires-natural as well as those set by Indians-maintained these open conditions (30,31,36,44,61). Post-settlement exclusion of fire permitted development of closed-canopy white oak stands that are typically of two ages-large spreading trees, now 270 to 330 years old, are scattered among smaller trees of narrow form, 60 to 150 years old (73). Where not restricted by agricultural practices, young oaks continue to encroach into grassland. But, in turn, many oak stands are being invaded and superseded by bigleaf maples or conifers, mainly Douglas-fir (fig. 4). A similar sequence of events is occurring in the northern oak woodland, a distinctive Oregon white oak type in California (5,51,69). Unless steps are taken to reverse present trends, the Oregon white oak type will continue to become a less prominent part of the western flora. A reduction in species diversity will also occur, for open-canopy communities have a more varied composition than closed conifer communities (13). Damaging Agents- Because of their attractiveness as food, seed crops of Oregon white oak are often decimated quickly (12). Larvae of the filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus) and the filbert weevil (Curculio occidentalis) damage crops even before acorns ripen (23). Maturing or ripe acorns are consumed by woodpeckers, pigeons, doves, jays, wood ducks, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, pocket gophers, woodrats, deer, bear, and other wildlife, as well as by domestic animals. Wind, wet snow, and freezing rain damage Oregon white oak less than associated hardwoods, but in tests it showed only moderate resistance to cold. Dormant buds collected northwest of Corvallis, OR, withstood -15° C (5° F) and twigs -20° C (-40 F) without injury (55). Large Oregon white oaks are obviously fire resistant; they have withstood annual or periodic fires for years. But small oaks may be killed or badly damaged by fire, as evidenced by the increased density and spread of oak stands since the advent of fire control. More than 110 pathogens have been found on the leaves, twigs, trunk, or roots of Oregon white oak (59). Most are of minor consequence; many are saprophytes. Leaf-spot, mildew, and anthracnose fungi sometimes attack the foliage, but control methods have been suggested for only one-an anthracnose disease (Gnomonia quercina). In 1968, this fungus caused moderate to severe dying of leaves and possibly death of oak trees in southern Pierce County, WA (14). Premature browning of foliage is occasionally widespread in the Willamette Valley, but the causes and effects have received only incidental attention. The hairy mistletoe is common on Oregon white oak in Oregon and California, forming conspicuous, rounded growths in the upper crown. Its effect on growth and vigor of this host is undetermined. The white pocket root and butt rot (Polyporus dryophilus) and the shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) are probably the most damaging rots found in Oregon white oak. Its heartwood is generally very durable; stumps and even relatively small stems may remain intact for years. Although Oregon white oak is host to hundreds of insect species (19), damage is usually not severe, and loss of trees to insect attack is uncommon. The western oak looper (Lambdina fiscellaria somniaria) is probably the most damaging insect on white oak from Oregon north to British Columbia. In some years, oaks over large areas in the Willamette Valley are defoliated (23). The damage is temporary since the trees leaf out the next year and outbreaks are not sustained. The western tent caterpillar (Malacosoma californicum) and the Pacific tent caterpillar (M. constrictum) are widely distributed defoliators with a preference for oaks. Several species of aphid, particularly Teberculatus columbiae, feed on the underside of oak leaves; the snowy tree cricket (Oecanthus fultoni) lives in open-grown oaks and associated species; and several leafrollers (Abebaea cervella and Pandemis cerasana) are found on Oregon white oak. Oregon white oak is the principal host for R. cerasana, an introduced leafroller causing sporadic defoliation that is now maintaining a relatively high population and slowly extending its range around Victoria, BC (17). Many gall wasps are found on oaks; those prominent on Oregon white oak include Andricus californicus, which forms large, persistent, applelike galls on twigs; Bassettia ligni, which causes seedlike galls under the bark of branches that often girdle and kill the branch; Besbicus mirabilis, which forms mottled, spherical galls on the underside of leaves; and Neuroterus saltatorius, which forms mustard-seed-like galls on lower leaf surfaces that drop in the fall and jump around like Mexican jumping beans caused by activity of the enclosed larvae (18,23). Only incidental damage by animals has been noted on vegetative parts of Oregon white oak. Douglas squirrels and western gray squirrels sometimes debark small branches infested by gall wasp larvae (64). Damage is scattered and may involve as much as one-fourth of a tree's crown. Gophers and other burrowing animals, which are abundant on forest borders, damage some roots. Livestock inflict some trampling and feeding damage on young oaks.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Oregon White Oak,quercus,garryana,hardwood,14,0
"Oregon white oak can grow on a wide variety of sites, but on good sites it is often crowded out by species that grow faster and taller. Hence, Oregon white oak is most common on sites that are too exposed or droughty for other tree species during at least part of the year, including inland valleys and foothills, south slopes, unglaciated and glaciated rocky ridges, and a narrow transition zone east of the Cascades between conifer forest and treeless, dissected plateau. Although usually considered a xeric species, Oregon white oak also commonly occurs in very moist locations-on flood plains, on heavy clay soils, and on river terraces. These locations appear to have two common characteristics-standing water or a shallow water table during a lengthy wet season and gravelly or heavy clay surface soils that probably are droughty during the extended dry season. The distribution of Oregon white oak gives evidence that it can withstand both lengthy flooding and drought. Oregon white oak grows on soils of at least four orders: Alfisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Ultisols. Specific soil series include Hugo and McMahon in coastal northern California and Goulding near Santa Rosa (75,78). In Oregon's Willamette Valley, Oregon white oak is found on soils derived from alluvial deposits (poorly drained gray brown Amity and Dayton series), sedimentary rocks (deep, welldrained brown Steiwer, Carlton, Peavine, Bellpine, Melbourne, and Willakenzie series), and basic igneous rocks (brown or reddish, moderately deep, well-drained Nekia, Dixonville, and Olympic series) (22,38,67,73). A subsurface clay layer that restricts water penetration is characteristic of soils in most of these series. White oak stands near Dufur in eastern Oregon grow in soils derived from basalt and andesite (32); in southern Oregon, they grow in soils derived from andesite, granite, and serpentine (79). On the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island, BC, seven soils supporting a vegetational sequence of grass, Oregon white oak, and Douglas-fir were gravelly loams or gravelly sandy loams that developed on young, nonhomogeneous parent materials (11). Soils under Oregon white oak stands are generally acidic, ranging in pH from 4.8 to 5.9 (11,75,78). Bulk densities ranging from 0.61 to 1.45 have been measured (73,78). Many white oak stands grow on gentle topography; only one-fourth of those examined in the Willamette Valley were on slopes greater than 30 percent (73).",Soils and Topography,Oregon White Oak,quercus,garryana,hardwood,15,0
"The wood of Oregon white oak is dense, with specific gravity ranging from 0.52 to 0.88 when ovendry (66), has moderate strength in static bending tests, but does not absorb shocks well (47). It rates high in compression and shear strength and is outstanding among 20 northwestern woods in tension and side hardness tests (47). The heartwood is at least as durable as that of white oak (Quercus alba) (58). Pallets made from Oregon white oak compare favorably in strength with those made from other species (66) and are higher in withdrawal resistance for nails or staples (41). Specialty items, fenceposts, and fuel are now the primary uses of Oregon white oak. The wood is considered one of the best fuels for home heating and commands top prices. It has been used for flooring, interior finish, furniture, cooperage staves, cabinet stock, insulator pins, woodenware, novelties, baskets, handle stock, felling wedges, agricultural implements, vehicles, and ship construction (60). Consumption of Oregon white oak totaled 12 454 m³ (2,185,000 fbm) exclusive of fuel in 1910 but has since declined (60). Although Oregon white oak is not grown commercially for landscape purposes, scattered native trees, groves, and open stands are highly valued scenic assets in wildland, farm, park, and urban areas (35,42,49,56). Mistletoe is a scenic growth on Oregon white oaks that is collected and sold as a decorative and festive minor product. Until recent times, meal or mush made from acorns of many oaks (including Oregon white oak) was a common Indian food (35,71,81). When crops were heavy, white oak acorns were also gathered and stored by local ranchers for feed, mainly for hogs. Livestock forage for acorns and prefer those of white oaks to black oaks (81). The leaves have a protein content of 5 to 14 percent (35,56), and Oregon white oak is rated as good to fair browse for deer but poor for domestic livestock. Oregon white oak woodlands and forests provide favorable habitat for wildlife (6) and also produce substantial amounts of forage for sheep and cattle (33). Infrequently, cattle are poisoned by foraging on oak; one instance involving Oregon white oak has been documented (37). Oak-dominated forests in the western part of the Willamette Valley in Oregon have a higher diversity of birds in all seasons than adjacent conifer forests (3). Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine-Oregon white oak associations are preferred brood habitats for Merriam's wild turkey in south-central Washington (39). Greenhouse experiments have shown that Oregon white oak is a good host for the gourmet truffle, Tuber melanosporum (43). The feasibility of managing Oregon white oak stands for truffle production, as many oak stands are managed in Europe, is being investigated.",Special Uses,Oregon White Oak,quercus,garryana,hardwood,16,0
"Osage-orange is not included in any of the forest types recognized by theSociety of American Foresters (13). In moist, well-drained minor bottom landsin northwestern Louisiana and nearby parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas, itis found with white oak Quercus alba), hickories (Carya spp.),white ash (Fraxinus americana), and red mulberry (Morus rubra)(37). In Nebraska and Kansas, it invades overgrazed pastures, accompaniedby honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos) and is succeeded by black walnut(Juglans nigra), oaks Quercus spp.), hackberry (Celtis spp.),hickories, and elms (Ulmus spp.) (18). Among the most commonassociates on lime stone- derived soils in middle Tennessee and neighboringportions of Kentucky and Alabama are eastern redcedar (Juniperusvirginiana), black walnut, hickories, and elms (45).",Associated Forest Cover,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,1,0
"Within the natural range of Osage-orange, average annual temperature rangesfrom about 18° to 21° C (65° to 70° F), July temperatureaverages 27° C (80° F) and January temperature ranges from 6° to7° C (43° to 45° F) with an extreme of -23° C (-10°F). The frost-free period averages 240 days. Average annual precipitationranges from 1020 to 1140 min (40 to 45 in), and April to September rainfallfrom 430 to 630 min (17 to 25 in).

"There is no known literature on the genetics of Osage-orange, and noinformation on geographic races is available. A thornless cultivar, Maclurapomifera var. inermis (André) Schneid., can be propagated bycuttings or scions taken from high in the crowns of old trees, where the twigsare thornless (30,31). The only known hybrid, x Macludrania hybridaAndré, is an intergeneric cross: x Macludrania = Cudrania xMaclura. Cudrania tricuspidata (Carr.) Bureau is a spiny shrub or smalltree, native to China, Japan, and Korea. The Maclura parent is varietyinermis. The hybrid is a small tree with yellowish furrowed bark andshort, woody spines (2,41). Some authorities believe that the tropicaldye-wood, fustic & ChIorophora tinctoria (L.) Gaud.é belongsin the genus Maclura; however, the majority opinion is that there isonly one species of Osage-orange (28).",Genetics,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,7,0
"The natural range of Osage-orange is in the Red River drainage of Oklahoma,Texas, and Arkansas; and in the Blackland Prairies, Post Oak Savannas, andChisos Mountains of Texas (28). According to some authors the original rangeincluded most of eastern Oklahoma (34), portions of Missouri (49,54), andperhaps northwestern Louisiana (28,49). Osage-orange has been planted as a hedge in all the 48 conterminous Statesand in southeastern Canada. The commercial range includes most of the countryeast of the Rocky Mountains, south of the Platte River and the Great Lakes,excluding the Appalachian Mountains. -The native range of osage-orange.",Native Range,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Osage-orange is dioecious. The simple, green,four-part flowers appear soon after the leaves on the same spurs, opening fromApril through June, and are wind pollinated. Male flowers are long peduncledaxillary racemes 2.5 to 3.8 cm (1 to 1.5 in) long on the terminal leaf spur ofthe previous season; female flowers are in dense globose heads, axillary to theleaves, about 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter (2). The female flower in ripeningbecomes very fleshy, forming a large multiple fruit or syncarp composed of1-seeded drupelets. The fruit ripens from September through October. The ripefruit, 7.6 to 15 ern (3 to 6 in) in diameter, yellowish-green, resembles anorange, often weighing more than a kilogram (2.2 lb). Fruits average 23/dkl (80to the bu) (53). When bruised, the fruit exudes a bitter milky juice which maycause a skin rash and which will blacken the fruit on drying. Female trees often produce abundant fruit when no male trees exist nearby,but such fruit contains no seeds. Seed Production and Dissemination- Female trees bear good seed cropsnearly every year, beginning about the 10th year. Commercial seed-bearing ageis optimum from 25 to 65 years, and 75 to 100 years may be the maximum (53).Germinative capacity averages 58 percent. Seeds are nearly I cm (0.4 in) inlength. The number of clean seeds ranges from 15,400 to 35,300, averaging30,900/kg (7,000 to 16,000, averaging 14,000/lb). Livestock, wild mammals, andbirds feed on the fruit and disseminate the seed. The seeds have a slightdormancy that is easily overcome by soaking in water for 48 hours or bystratifying in sand or peat for 30 days. Fruit stored over winter in pilesoutdoors is easily cleaned in the spring, and the seed germinates promptly.Viability can be maintained for at least 3 years by storing cleaned, air-driedseeds in sealed containers at 5° C (41° F) (56). Recommended sowingdepth is about 6 to 13 min (0.25 to 0.5 in); soil should be firmed. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Natural regenerationapparently requires exposed mineral soil and full light. A study of survivaland growth in the Prairie States Forestry Project windbreaks indicated averagesurvival of Osage-orange at age 7 years to be 68 percent, ranking seventh of 16""shrubs""; total height was 2.4 m (8 ft), ranking fifth of 16; andcrown spread was 1.8 m (6 ft). Osage-orange was usually planted in the shrub(outer) rows and sometimes in the tree (inner) rows. It grows too fast,however, to be considered a shrub and often overtops slower growing conifers(33). Vegetative Reproduction- Osage-orange may be vegetatively propagatedusing root cuttings or with greenwood cuttings under glass. To propagatethornless male (nonfruiting) clones for ornamental use, scions or cuttingsshould be taken only from the mature part of the crown of a tree past thejuvenile stage. Perhaps the easiest way to grow selected stock is by graftingchip buds onto nursery-run seedlings and plastic-wrapping the graft area(30,31).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Osage-orange is a small tree or large shrubaveraging 9 m (30 ft) in height at maturity. Isolated trees on good sites mayreach heights of as much as 21 m (70 ft); crowded trees usually do not grow sotall. In windbreak plantings on the Great Plains, Osage-orange grew 6 m (20 ft)tall on average sites during a 20-year period; on some sites it grew 12 m (40ft) tall (39). Branchlets growing in full sunlight bear sharp, stout thorns. Slow-growingtwigs in the shaded portions of the crown of mature trees are thornless. Thethorns, 1.3 to 2.5 cm (0.5 to 1 in) long, are modified twigs. They form in leafaxils on 1-year-old twigs. Shade-killed lower branches remain on the tree manyyears. Regional estimates, based on the 19641966 Forest Surveys, indicatedvirtually no Osage-orange of commercial size and quality on forest land inOklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana. There are two reasons for this: the speciesusually grows on nonforest land, and merchantability standards for forest treesdo not apply to Osage-orange. Mature trees have short, curved boles and low,wide, deliquescent crowns. Even in closed stands on good sites, less than halfthe stems contain a straight log, 3 m (10 ft) long, sound and free of shake. Rooting Habit- Osage-orange is characteristically deep rooted, butbecause it has been planted so widely, the species is usually off-site, whereits rooting habit is variable. When the tree grows on shallow, fertile soilsover limestone, the lateral rootspread is tremendous (32). Excavation of root systems in 7-year-old or older shelterbelts revealed alateral radius of 4.3 m (14 ft) and a depth of more than 8.2 m (27 ft) forOsage-orange near Goodwell, OK (9). The soil was Richfield silt loam. Most ofthe lateral roots were in the uppermost 0.3 m (1 ft) of soil. Excavations inNebraska revealed a lateral radius of 2.1 m (7 ft) and a depth of 1.5 m (5 ft)for 3-year-old Osage-orange in Wabash silt loam; for 23-year-old Osage-orangein Sogn silty clay loam, lateral radius was 4.9 m (16 ft) and depth was 2.4 m(8 ft) (47). At both ages, there was a well-developed taproot, and most of thelong laterals originated within the first 0.3 m (I ft) of soil. At 3 years,most of the long laterals were within the first 0.6 m (2 ft) of soil; at 23years, laterals were as abundant in the eighth as in the first foot of soil. Reaction to Competition- Osage-orange is tolerant according to someauthors (6,37) and very intolerant according to others (3). Overall, it is mostaccurately classed as intolerant of shade. The occurrence and circumstances ofnatural regeneration suggest intolerance, but the growth of plantedOsage-orange in hedges and shelterbelts, under strong competition, indicatestolerance. How vigorously and at how advanced an age the species responds torelease has not been deter-mined. Severe competition does not prevent abundantseed production. Osage-orange sprouts vigorously, even following cutting ofinterior rows in windbreaks. No literature on the silviculture of naturally regenerated forest stands ofOsage-orange is known. Damaging Agents- Although Osage-orange is one of the healthiest treespecies in North America, it is attacked by some parasites. Cotton root rot,caused by Phymatotrichum omnivorum, attacks Osage-orange and most otherwindbreak species in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arizona (59). Losses are greatest inplantings on dry soil where rainfall is scant. Cotton root rot is the onlyserious disease. Two species of mistletoe, Phoradendron serotinum and P.tomentosum, grow in the branches and cause witches' brooms. Osage-orangeornamentals in the Northeast have occasionally succumbed to Verticilliurn wilt,caused by Verticillium albo-atrum. Leafspot diseases are caused byOvularia maclurae, Phyllosticta maclurae, Sporodesmium maclurae, Septoriaangustissima, Cercospora maclurae, and Cerotelium fici. Seedlings ina Nebraska nursery have been killed by damping-off and root rot caused byPhythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani (21). Phellinus ribisattacks stemwood exposed in wounds. Poria ferruginosa and P.punctata are the only two wood-destroying basidiomycetes reported onOsage-orange; they occur only on dead wood, mainly in tropical and subtropicalparts of the western hemisphere (21). Maclura mosaic virus and cucumber mosaicvirus have been identified in leaf tissue of Osage-orange in Yugoslavia (35). Osage-orange trees are attacked by at least four stem borers: the mulberryborers (Doraschema wildii and D. alternatum) (4), the paintedhickory borer (Megacyllene caryae), and the red-shouldered hickory borer(Xylobiops basilaris) (8). The twigs are parasitized by several scaleinsects including the European fruit lecanium (Parthenolecanium corni),the walnut scale (Quadraspidiotus juglansregiae) the cottony maple scale(Pulvinaria innumerabilis) the terrapin scale (Mesolecaniumnigrofasciatum), and the San Jose scale (Quadraspidiotus perniciosus)(25,46). The fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospilus) feeds onopening buds and unfolding leaves. Osage-orange is attacked by, but is not a principal host of, the fallwebworm (Hyphantria cunea) (55), an Eriophyid mite, Tegolophusspongiosus (51), and the fourspotted spider mite, Tetranychus canadensis(4). Osage-orange trees and several other species in 1 to 5-year-old plantationson old fields in the prairie region of Illinois were partially or completelygirdled by mice. Severity of damage was greatest where weeds were most abundant(26). Windbreaks on the Great Plains, unless given cultivation during their earlyyears, are invaded by herbaceous vegetation, become sod bound, and arepermanently damaged (33,38,39). This vegetation may harbor rodents. Grazing isnot satisfactory for herbage control; multiple-row windbreaks should be fencedto exclude livestock. Osage-orange sustained less damage by insects, diseases, drought, hail, andglaze than any other species planted in the Prairie States Forestry Project.Along with bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) it survived better than anyother deciduous species on uplands of the Southern Plains (7,38).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,14,0
"Even within the limited native range, growth of Osage-orange beforeagricultural settlement was restricted to about 26 000 km² (10,000mi²) , and probably half that area produced no trees of merchantable size(17,32). Some pure stands covered as much as 40 ha (100 acres), but most weremuch smaller. Pure stands appeared on rich bottom-land Soils and were called""bodark swamps"" (colloquialism for bois-d'arc). Though not trueswamps, these areas frequently became inundated. Over much of its naturalrange, particularly south of the Red River, Osage-orange grew in isolated smallstands, either pure or mixed with other hardwoods, interspersed with prairie.The largest trees and those of the best quality grew on bottom lands of the RedRiver tributaries in Oklahoma. Most bodark swamps have been converted tofields, and within the Red River system today Osage-orange grows most commonlyon sandy terraces not yet occupied by other vegetation and on Blackland Prairiesoils underlain by chalk or marl. Distribution and abundance of naturalregeneration seem to depend more on lack of competition than on kind, quality,or condition of soil. Osage-orange readily escapes from cultivation and invades exposed, erodingsoil, particularly in overgrazed pastures. Thickets are characteristicallyfound along fence rows, ditch banks, ravines, and around abandoned farmsteads. Most observers report that Osage-orange grows vigorously on all soils(32,34). Some state, however, that hedges planted on soil from which the Alhorizon is removed do not thrive as well as those on less eroded sites (48). Onsandy soils where the topsoil has blown away, growth of Osage-orange (and otherspecies) in the Prairie States Forestry Project is strongly retarded (33).Natural regeneration is abundant and vigorous on many soils (Alfisols,Ultisols, Vertisols, and Mollisols), including those too alkaline for mostforest trees. The species is sensitive to soil compaction. It thrives best onmoist soils but tolerates extreme drought. It is resistant to heat, road salt(22), and urban air pollution (42).",Soils and Topography,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,15,0
"Osage-orange has been planted in great numbers, first as a field hedge,before barbed wire became available, secondly as a windbreak and component ofshelterbelts, and thirdly to stabilize soils and control erosion. The single-row field hedge proved to be a valuable windbreak on the prairie;evidence of this was the raised ground level under 15-year-old hedges, causedby accumulation of windborne soil material. Hedges around every quarter-sectionwere common, especially in areas of deep sand (20,38). These hedges were asource of durable posts. Prairie farmers customarily clearcut hedges on a 10-to 16-year cycle, obtaining about 2,500 fence posts per kilometer (4,000 permi) of single-row hedge. The slash was piled over the stumps to protect the newsprouts from browsing livestock. Pole-sized and larger Osage-orange trees arepractically immune to browsing, but seedlings and tender sprouts are highlysusceptible. Recommended practice is to thin the new sprout stands to 240vigorous stems per 100 m (73/100 ft), 3 to 5 years after the clearcut, and toprotect the sprouts from fire. If inadvertently burned, the sprouts should becut back immediately to encourage new, vigorous growth (20). Osage-orange heartwood is the most decay-resistant of all North Americantimbers and is immune to termites. The outer layer of sapwood is very thin;consequently, even small-diameter stems give long service as stakes and posts(40,43). About 3 million posts were sold annually in Kansas during the early1970's. The branch wood was used by the Osage Indians for making bows and isstill recommended by some archers today. The chemical properties of the fruit, seed, roots, bark, and wood may bemore important than the structural qualities of the wood. A number ofextractives have been identified by researchers, but they have not yet beenemployed by industry (11,12,23, 24,44,58). Numerous organic compounds have alsobeen obtained from various parts of the tree (16,44,57). An antifungal agentand a nontoxic antibiotic useful as a food preservative have been extractedfrom the heartwood (5,24). Osage-orange in prairie regions provides valuable cover and nesting sitesfor quail, pheasant, other birds, and animals (20,33), but the bitter-tastingfruit is little eaten by wildlife. Reports that fruit causes the death oflivestock have been proven wrong by feeding experiments in several States. Osage-orange has been successfully used in strip mine reclamation. Its easeof planting, tolerance of alkaline soil, and resistance to drought aredesirable qualities (1,14,29). These qualities plus growth, long life, andresistance to injury by ice, wind, insects, and diseases make Osage-orange avalued landscape plant (15,30,31).",Special Uses,Osage-Orange,maclura,pomifera,hardwood,16,0
"Overcup oak is usually a dominant species only in the forest cover type Overcup Oak-Water Hickory (Society of American Foresters Type 96) (4). The species most commonly associated with overcup oak are water hickory (Carya aquatica), willow oak (Quercus phellos), Nuttall oak (Q. nuttallii), American elm (Ulmus americana), cedar elm (U. crassifolia), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), waterlocust (Gleditsia aquatica), common persimmon (Diospyros uirginiana), and red maple (Acer rubrum). Overcup oak is a minor component in the following forest cover types: Sweetgum-Willow Oak (Type 92), Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93), Baldcypress (Type 101), and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102). Trees infrequently associated with overcup oak include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), black willow (Salix nigra), water oak (Quercus nigra), and sycamore (Platanus occidentalis).

It grows northward in the Mississippi Valley to southeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and western Kentucky (8). -The native range of overcup oak.",Native Range,Overcup Oak,quercus,lyrata,hardwood,11,0
"Wide differences in quality of overcup oak occur over its range-generally the better quality is found in its northern and eastern range. These differences, however, are probably due to response to site and seasonal flooding patterns rather than to genetic differences. Limited studies of juvenile variation within a small geographic area have not provided any evidence of genetic variation among localities.",Population Differences,Overcup Oak,quercus,lyrata,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Male and female flowers appear while the leaves are developing during April and May in the Mississippi Delta. The staminate flowers are borne in naked aments (catkins) with the pistillate flowers in flowered spikes on this monoecious tree (11). The fruit, an acorn, is 12 to 25 mm (0.5 to I in) long, has a flattened spherical shape, usually broader at the base than long, and may be entirely covered by a scaly cup-hence the common name of the species, overcup oak. The acorns mature in 1 year, ripen by September or October, and fall soon after. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees begin bearing seeds about 25 years of age and good seed crops are produced every 3 to 4 years. Late freezes, after the flower buds have started to open have been known to kill the flowers and thus destroy the seed crop. Cleaned seeds average 308/kg (140/lb) (11). The seeds are disseminated to some extent by flood waters. Animals, especially squirrels, spread some acorns, but overcup acorns are less preferred than those of many other oak species. Acorn insects, particularly acorn weevils (Curculio spp.), may destroy a major part of the seed crop during light seed years, but are less important during good seed years. Seedling Development- In flooded areas the acorns remain dormant over winter and germinate in the spring after the surface waters recede, making overcup acorns one of the few of the white oak group that do not germinate until spring (10). Germination is hypogeal (11). Natural reproduction is prolific, but many young seedlings are killed by inundation during the first few growing seasons. Seeds germinate readily either in the open or in the shade, but because of the tree's relative intolerance to shade, reproduction persists only in openings (13). Seedlings and stump sprouts generally are able to grow through all competing ground cover except heavy peppervine, which sometimes develops into a tangled mat (10). Successful regeneration depends on complete absence of fire and adequate seed. Growth of seedlings is rated as average but varies greatly with site, soil, and the kind and degree of competition (13). Eight-year-old trees on a backwater flat were found to vary from 12 to 75 mm (0.5 to 3 in) in diameter at groundline (10). There is little information on early height growth, but based on site index figures, height growth might be expected to average 45 to 60 cm (18 to 24 in) per year (2). Vegetative Reproduction- Stumps of small trees sprout vigorously but not consistently; therefore, stump sprouts cannot be relied upon as a silvicultural practice to regenerate the stand. Successful whip, cleft, and bark grafts of overcup oak and its hybrids have been reported, but T-bud grafts have failed and cuttings from hybrids do not root (10).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Overcup Oak,quercus,lyrata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Overcup oak produces a medium-size tree 18 to 27 m (60 to 90 ft) in height and 61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 in) in diameter (10,12). Maximum height rarely exceeds 30 m (100 ft) and diameters exceeding 91 cm (36 in) are uncommon. Maximum age attained is about 400 years (6). Overcup oak commonly develops a short trunk, frequently crooked or spiraled, and a broad, wide-spreading, open crown or major branches bearing relatively few smaller branches (12). The bole is rarely clear for any great length; however, on the better sites it may develop a trunk clear of large branches having lengths of 12 m (40 ft) or more. Height growth of overcup oak is slower than many of its associates, causing it to be overtopped easily, which may partially account for the short crooked boles. Diameter growth for trees free to grow in unmanaged stands on average bottomland sites averages about 5.0 to 6.4 cm (2 to 2.5 in) in 10 years (13). On the best sites it may grow 10 cm (4 in) in 10 years, but old trees on low flats subject to backwater overflow may grow only 5 cm (2 in) in diameter in 50 years. Under management on average or better sites, the overcup oak-water hickory type should yield about 2.8 m³/ha (200 fbm/acre) (International quarter-inch log rule) or more per year (1). The quality of overcup oak varies greatly throughout its range but is generally medium to poor due to insects, shake, and other factors. Overcup oak is said to produce only about half as much No. 1 Common and Better lumber as the other white oaks (5). Next to post oak it has been referred to as the ""poorest of the white oaks"" (13). In fact, it has been stated that ""overcup oak from overflow sites in the Mississippi Delta is one of the most obstinate, cantankerous woods that ever a kiln operator tried to dry"" (7). For many years operators discriminated against overcup oak on overflow sites because it could not be dried without serious checking and honeycombing. This no-cut practice reached a point where overcup oak dominated many cutover sites. Quality is generally poorest in the southern half of the Mississippi River Delta. North of the latitude from Eudora, AR, to Greenwood, MS, it is of fair to very good quality. Within these areas, quality tends to be best on the better drained second bottoms and terrace soils and toward the outer edges of the Delta, and especially on the older geologic formations to the north (15). In the bottoms of the larger streams in Georgia and the Carolinas its quality is usually good. Rooting Habit- Overcup oak develops a shallow, saucer-shaped root system. The heavy clay soils and wet sites where overcup oak typically grows restrict root development to relatively shallow depths. Although the seedlings initially produce taproots, these are replaced by a lateral root system. The root system of one large tree consisted of many small branching roots with no large main roots. Reaction to Competition- Overcup oak is classed as intermediate in its response to competition and shade (10,131). Seeds germinate profusely beneath complete canopy, but the seedlings invariably succumb or at least die back to the root collar within 3 years unless released. Many stands of overcup oak owe their development to tolerance of early season flooding that kills off earlier flushing species. It is frequently a lack of competition rather than an affinity for the backwater sites that allows this species to dominate. Because of its tolerance of flooding, overcup oak growing on low backwater flats is classified as a climax species (10). But on better sites where it grows in combination with other oaks, green ash, and sweetgum, it becomes a subclimax tree. Because of its slow growth rate, poor quality, drying difficulties, and low commercial value, woodsmen usually try to favor other species of better quality. Damaging Agents- Overcup oak is notorious for many defects, a reputation due largely to wood borers and the rapid decay of heartwood following fire injuries (6). Loss from insect borer degrade in lumber sawn from sample overcup oak logs in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, updated to 1980 lumber prices, amounted to $22.80/m³ ($130/ thousand fbm) (9). The carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae) and red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus) are the two most damaging large trunk borers of sawtimber-producing galleries in the wood 12 to 18 min (0.5 to 0.7 in) in diameter and 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) long (14). The white oak borer (Goes tigrinus) is damaging to young trees but limits its attacks to saplings and poles up to about 20 cm (8 in) in diameter. This oak, growing on sites subjected to backwater flooding from December through June, is sometimes rendered almost worthless by a spot-worm borer (Agrilus acutipennis), which leaves a tiny frass-packed hole surrounded by a dark-stained area, descriptively named grease spot. This defect seriously degrades lumber and ruins its wood for tight cooperage. Another common defect in overcup oak lumber is bark pocket, caused by several borers but particularly the red oak borer and carpenterworm, which initiate attacks in the bark and cambium area but succumb before galleries are made in the sapwood. When these spots heal, pockets of ingrown bark and stained wood are formed. These remain in the trunk as the tree grows and appear as defects in lumber and other products. Other insects, including the defoliators, usually are not very harmful, but periodic outbreaks such as the 1952 outbreak of the basswood leafminer, Baliosus ruber, can severely weaken trees and reduce growth. Except for the heart rots (Poria spp., Polyporus spp., Hericium spp.), which follow injuries, especially those due to fire, diseases are not serious in overcup oak. A viruslike disorder of overcup oak seedlings has been studied but appears to be either physiologically induced or of genetic origin.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Overcup Oak,quercus,lyrata,hardwood,14,0
"Overcup oak is found on poorly drained, alluvial, clayey soils mainly on southern river flood plains (13). It is most prevalent on low lying clay or silty clay flats in first bottoms and terraces of the larger streams (15). It is also quite common on the edges of swamps, sloughs, and bayous; in poorly drained depressions or sink holes on ridges; and in shallow swamps and sloughs (12). Overall it is most commonly found growing on soils in the orders Inceptisols and Alfisols. The overcup oak-water hickory type is often predominant on poorly drained backwater flats and small shallow sloughs commonly flooded for a few weeks after the growing season begins (10). Overcup oak is one of the trees most tolerant of flooding (3). Since it leafs out a month or more later than most species, it is better able to endure submergence from late spring floods. In tests, overcup oak survived continuous flooding for at least two growing seasons. In spite of its natural occurrence on wet clay sites, overcup oak grows best on sites with better drainage and soil texture (10).",Soils and Topography,Overcup Oak,quercus,lyrata,hardwood,15,0
"The utility of overcup oak varies extremely with site, fire damage, and degree of insect and decay defect (13). Logs harvested from the best overcup oak sites may be used for lumber and sometimes tight cooperage, but the wood is frequently worthless for factory lumber and other quality products. Moreover, checking during seasoning often prevents general use even as ties and timbers. The species is sometimes used for ornamental purposes. The trees provide habitat and the acorns supply mast for wildlife.",Special Uses,Overcup Oak,quercus,lyrata,hardwood,16,0

"Pacific madrone ranges from the east coast of Vancouver Island and the immediate mainland of British Columbia (lat. 50° N.) southward to near Palomar Mountain, San Diego County, CA (lat. 33° N.), a north-south distance of about 1880 kin (1,170 mi). The species is common along the western slopes of the Coast Ranges in Washington, Oregon, and California, southward to San Luis Obispo County, CA. It is abundant throughout much of the Klamath Mountains of Oregon and California, and from Yuba County, CA, southward through Calaveras County in the Sierra Nevada. -The native range of Pacific madrone. In western British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon, the climate best suited to Pacific madrone is characterized by mild temperatures with prolonged cloudy periods, narrow diurnal fluctuation, and limited extremes. Average January temperatures range from 2° to 8° C (36° to 46° F) and average July temperatures from 10° to 20° C (50° to 68° F). Winters generally are wet and mild, and summers cool and relatively dry with long frost-free seasons. Average annual precipitation is usually abundant, ranging from 790 to more than 3000 mm (31 to 118 in), 75 to 85 percent of which is received between October 1 and March 1, mostly as rain. In the interior valleys and hills of the Klamath Mountains and lower west slopes of the southern Cascades, average January temperatures range from 2° to 5° C (36° to 41° F) and average July temperatures from 17° to 25° C (62° to 77° F). Average annual precipitation varies between 760 and 890 mm (30 and 35 in). The average January temperature in the heart of the Pacific madrone range in the Sierra Nevada is 5° C (41° F), and the average July temperature is 22° C (72° F). Average annual precipitation is 1730 mm (68 in). In the Coast Ranges of California, temperatures where Pacific madrone grows average 2° to 5° C (36° to 41° F) in January and 15° to 20° C (59° to 68° F) in July. Average precipitation varies between 1140 and 1650 mm (45 and 65 in) yearly in the north to 640 to 760 mm (25 to 30 in) in the south. Some fog usually is present throughout this region. Within the total range of this species, temperature extremes are from -21° to 46° C (-6° to 115° F) and annual rainfall from 460 to 4220 mm (18 to 166 in) (30). Soils on which Pacific madrone is found are derived from glacial deposits of porous sands and gravels and hard till in the north, through volcanic tuffs and metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the Klamath Mountains, to volcanic and sedimentary rocks in the California Coast Ranges. Granitic and metavolcanic rocks support the species in the Sierra Nevada. Most Pacific madrones are found on Alfisols, followed to a much lesser extent by Ultisols and Inceptisols. The soils show a wide range of textures, varying from fine-textured loams and clay loams to coarse-textured sandy loams and gravelly clay loams. Rocky soils are common, and many are less than I in (3.3 ft) deep. A common soil characteristic is good internal drainage and low moisture retention in summer. Many extensive soil series have been identified as supporting Pacific madrone (table 1). In California, madrone has been found on more than 30 soil series. Pacific madrone grows on a variety of terrain from nearly level flats and gently sloping benches to steep mountainsides. Often it is found in canyons near creeks and rivers. In general, madrone grows on all aspects but is found most often on those facing south and west. In southern California, however, madrone often is abundant in cool canyons-about the only place in this area where the species is found. In the northern part of its range, Pacific madrone grows at or near sea level, extends up rivers, and inhabits mountain slopes to the 915 m (3,000 ft) elevation. The species ranges from 455 to 915 m (1,500 to 3,000 ft) and, occasionally, to 1435 m (4,700 ft) in the Klamath Mountains. In the California Coast Ranges, Pacific madrone grows well from 245 to 1300 rn (800 to 4,260 ft). It is found from about 365 to 1065 m (1,200 to 3,490 ft) in the Sierra Nevada but is more common between 700 and 975 m (2,300 and 3,200 ft). At the southern end of its range in the Transverse and Peninsular Mountains, madrone grows from 610 to 1065 m (2,000 to 3,490 ft). Pacific madrone is a major component of the forest cover type Douglas-fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Society of American Foresters Type 234) (4), and an associated species in a wide variety of others including Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Douglas-Fir - Western Hemlock (Type 230), Port Orford-Cedar (Type 231), Redwood (Type 232), Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245), Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244), Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243), Knobcone Pine (Type 248), California Live Oak (Type 255), Canyon Live Oak (Type 249), Oregon White Oak (Type 233), and California Black Oak (Type 246). The Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone forest cover type is characterized by Douglas-fir as the overstory species and tanoak and madrone as secondary canopy. Regardless of stand structure and species mix in earlier stages of succession, the relative position of Pacific madrone at maturity is constant. The proportion of tanoak and madrone in the secondary canopy, however, varies widely. Higher proportions of madrone usually are found in drier locales, particularly on south aspects (14). Fossilized leaves of a species similar to modernday Pacific madrone have been found in northwestern Nevada, the Blue Mountains of Oregon, and Tuolumne County, CA. This species and associated flora date to the Miocene epoch of 12 to 26 million years ago. In terms of species composition, the flora resembles the oak-madrone forest of the central coastal mountains in California today (2). In western British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon, Pacific madrone intermingles extensively with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana), red alder (Alnus rubra), and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). Common associates in the Klamath Mountains and southern Cascades are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa), California black oak (Quercus kelloggii), and Oregon white oak, with sugar pine (P. lambertiana), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana), Port- Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis), knobcone pine (P. attenuata), and bigleaf maple locally present. In the northern and central California Coast Ranges, Douglas-fir, tanoak, redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), canyon live oak, and California-laurel (Umbellularia californica) mix with Pacific madrone. Common associates in the southern California mountains are Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii), California black oak, canyon live oak, coast live oak, and bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa). Smaller trees (11) that are common throughout the range of Pacific madrone from Vancouver Island or immediate mainland of British Columbia southward through Washington, Oregon, and northern California are vine maple (Acer circinatum), Rocky Mountain maple (A. glabrum), black hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii), Pacific bayberry (Myrica californica), Sitka alder (Alnus sinuata), bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata), western serviceberry (,Amelanchier alnifolia), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), western dogwood (C. occidentalis), redosier dogwood (C. stolonifera), Pacific willow (Salix lasiandra), Scouler willow (S. scoulerana), Pacific red elder (Sambucus callicarpa), blue elder (S. cerulea), and California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica). Others, too numerous to mention, have more limited distributions within madrone's natural range. Pacific madrone grows individually or in groves. It rarely forms large stands, and pure stands of any size are seldom seen. Madrone often is associated with two or more hardwood species in groups interspersed among conifers. The groups can be large or small, however, depending on the size of logged units or burns. In California's central Coast Ranges, mixed hardwood stands are extensive over a large portion of the forested landscape (24). Occasionally, Pacific madrone forms a woodland with other conifer and hardwood associates. In the valleys of the Umpqua and Rogue Rivers of southwestern Oregon, California black oak, Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone form a stunted open cover on the low rounded hills. Scattered Douglas-firs occasionally are present (6,26). Several investigators have placed Pacific madrone and associated species along measured decreasing moisture gradients in the field. In coastal northern California, madrone ranked fourth of 10 species in ability to extract moisture from the soil. Another investigator placed madrone first of 10 species for this ability in the central western Cascade Range of Oregon. Plainly, madrone is found in drier environments. Madrone also was ranked by other environmental variables. Relative to 20 northwestern tree associates, madrone was listed in the group of four species judged best adapted to warm temperatures. Further, madrone was in a group that placed fifth to seventh of 23 species ranked from high to low in tolerance of drought (15). At least one author described the species as being resistant to ice damage because water quickly ran off the waxy leaves and did not freeze on them. Another stated that heavy wet snowfalls place brittle-limbed madrone at a disadvantage. The species was judged the least frost-resistant tree native to British Columbia. Occasionally, madrones in Washington and Oregon are damaged by severe frosts. Shrub associates are fairly numerous, as could be expected for a species with a large natural range; they are greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), whiteleaf manzanita (A. viscida), bearberry (A. uva-ursi), Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus), deerbrush (C. integerrimus), squawcarpet (C. prostratus), snowbrush (C. velutinus), salal (Gaultheria shallon), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), huckleberry oak (Quercus vaccinifolia), western poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), Sierra gooseberry (Ribes roezlii), wood rose (Rosa gymnocarpa), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), salmonberry (R. spectabilis), trailing blackberry (R. ursinus), spreading snowberry (Symphoricarpos acutus), creeping snowberry (S. mollis), and evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum). Only occasionally, as in the California north Coast Range forest, is the shrub layer dense (24). Both the shrub and herb communities tend to be sparse under mature stands.",Habitat,Pacific Madrone,arbutus,menziesii,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowers of Pacific madrone are small, whitish, perfect, and urn-shaped. They are borne in dense racemes of terminal panicles. Madrone flowers in mid-March at lower elevations with warm temperatures, and in mid-May at higher elevations. Flowering usually ends in June. The fruit, a berry 8 to 12 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) in diameter, has a dry mealy flesh and generally is five-celled. Fruits mature from mid-September to mid-November Ripe berries are bright red or reddish-orange. Yellowish-orange or even yellowish-green berries, however, also may be present in the same cluster at the same time. Number of seeds per berry ranges from 2 to 37, averaging about 20. Seed Production and Dissemination- Pacific madrone is described as providing abundant fruit almost every year (23). On a good site in the Sierra Nevada from 1958 through 1977, however, bumper seed crops were produced in 2 years, light crops in 8 years, and little or no seed in 10 years. Berry production during a light seed year for three representative trees, 23, 36, and 41 cm (9, 14, and 16 in) in breastheight diameter, ranged from 13,320 to more than 107,000 per tree and seemed to relate best to the amount of living crown (12). Pacific madrone first produces berries at 3 to 5 years (23). In the northern Sierra Nevada, the dominant sprout in a 4-year-old clump produced 62 berries. Trees 60 to 160 years old produce heavy seed crops if healthy, but the age at which berries no longer are produced is unknown. Freshly picked red and yellow berries from the northern Sierra Nevada were weighed and numbers of berries and seeds counted. Berries numbered 1,390 to 2,490/kg (630 to 1,130/lb), and seeds 434,310 to 705,470/kg (197,000 to 320,000/lb) (23). Pacific madrone berries are disseminated by gravity and consumers. Because the berries are heavy, they fall directly beneath tree crowns, generally into a thick layer of tough leathery leaves. They do not bounce or roll far. Animals, however, often carry the berries farther away from tree crowns. Madrone berries are prized as food by birds, rodents, deer, and wood rats. At least five species of birds, especially the mourning dove and band-tailed pigeon, devour berries. More than 17 percent of this pigeon's November diet and 11 percent of its December diet were madrone berries. Stomach analysis of one pigeon indicated that it had eaten 111 berries - so many that it could not fly (25). In the northern Sierra Nevada, snap traps baited with a single red berry caught more white-footed deer mice than those with peanut butter and wheatflakes (12). Seedling Development- Germination of Pacific madrone seed is epigeal and has been described as both moderately high and fair. A test in California gave 55 percent germination after 3 months stratification at 2° to 5° C (36° to 41° F). Two other investigators recommended 3 months of stratification. A laboratory study on seed from the Sierra Nevada, however, indicated that a shorter stratification period might be adequate: seed stratified at 2° C (36° F) for 30 to 40 days with no other treatment produced 94 percent germination. Immersing seed in concentrated sulfuric acid for 1 minute before stratification also gave good results, but applying heat for 1 hour at 95° C (203° F) and then stratifying seriously impaired germination (12). To evaluate seedling establishment under more natural conditions, germinating seeds in a laboratory were buried in unsterilized sandy loam and no fungicide was applied. Damping-off fungi killed most of the seedlings, and after 11 months, only 6 percent survived. Trials of seedlings from madrone berries in the laboratory and field also indicated high losses from damping-off fungi. A comprehensive study in the Santa Cruz Mountains of central coastal California (20) showed that fungus attack directly killed 28 percent of madrone seedlings. An additional 22.7 percent mortality, however, was attributed to mild drought preceded by crippling from root decay fungi. Most of the remaining seedling mortality was caused by invertebrates, chiefly slugs. These pests were particularly lethal to seedlings in deep shade. None of the 276 seedlings on shady plots survived. Losses of seedlings on sunny plots in the semi-open forest were caused mainly by fungi. Only 2 percent of the seedlings on these plots survived to August 2 of the year in which they germinated. In southwestern Oregon, all Pacific madrone seeds germinated the first year after seeds ripened. However, seedlings began to die immediately after emergence and most had died after I year. Cause of death, in descending order, was lack of soil moisture, litterfall, damping off, and invertebrates. First-year mortality was 90 to 100 percent (29). In general, Pacific madrone seedlings are not abundant. They usually become established in disturbed areas, along road cuts, on bare mineral soil at the base of uprooted trees, or in semi-open forests. In the northern Sierra Nevada, seedlings are established mainly along partially shaded road cuts or in small shaded openings. Occasionally, they become established beneath woody shrubs or small trees in clearcuttings. In southwestern Oregon, percent survival after 3 years, although low, was higher in clearcuttings than in young and old stands (29). The most favorable seedbed for establishment seems to be bare mineral soil free from all, or nearly all, organic material. The notable lack of madrone seedlings beneath madrone trees could be the result of toxic metabolites being formed as an end product of the interaction among fungi, duff moisture content, and invertebrates. Water-soluble leachates from senescent leaves of madrone have been demonstrated to inhibit germination and lower growth of Douglas-fir seedlings in the laboratory (3,31), a finding not substantiated in the field (17,31). Early growth of Pacific madrone seedlings is slow. In the Santa Cruz Mountains, shoot and root elongation of 6-month-old seedlings in the sunny environment was 4 cm (2 in) for shoots and 10 cm (4 in) for roots; in the shady environment, 3 cm (1 in) for shoots and 4 cm (2 in) for roots. Two-year-old seedlings in the Sierra Nevada averaged 9 cm (3.5 in) tall. Death of madrone seedlings from transplanting has been described as distressingly high, but ease of propagation from cuttings as fair. Vegetative Reproduction- Pacific madrone reproduces mainly by sprouting. Sprouts arise from dormant buds formed at or just above the root collar and tend to be numerous. More than 300 sprouts were counted on a single low 10-inch-diameter Pacific madrone stump in the northern Sierra Nevada. Low stumps generally produce more sprouts than high stumps. High stumps sometimes support undesirable stool sprouts that form on the edge of the cut surface or, less commonly, on the vertical portion of the stump between the ground and the top. Stool sprouts tend to become infected with heart rot at an early age and are more susceptible, to dieback and death than sprouts from the root crown. Stool sprouts that survive seem to grow well, but their longevity is unknown. Pacific madrone sprouts grow rapidly. On a site of medium quality in the Klamath Mountains, 3-yearold sprout clumps averaged 13 members per clump, 3.1 in (10 ft) in height, and 2.3 in (7.6 ft) in width (22). In the northern Sierra Nevada on a good site, the annual enlargement of sprout clumps was measured in both a clearcut and a shelterwood. After 10 years, sprouts were taller, 6.7 vs 3.0 in (22 vs 10 ft); wider, 3.1 vs 2.1 in (10.1 vs 7.0 ft); contained more sprouts (15 vs 7); and possessed more volume, 52.1 vs 19.8 cm³ (1,840 vs 700 ft³) (12). In both locations, annual growth of 1.5 in (5 ft) on 2- to 5-year-old sprouts was observed for particularly vigorous members of a clump. Seven years after cutting and burning in southwest Oregon, dense stands of madrone sprout clumps spaced 2.7 by 2.7 in (9 by 9 ft) had a basal area of about 22 m²/ha (96 ft²/acre), 84 percent cover, and an above-ground biomass of 25,000 kg/ha (22,500 lb/acre) (9). This rapid early growth, both in height and crown width, allows Pacific madrone to dominate conifer and shrub associates for many years. It also means that understory species of grasses, forbs, and shrubs are quickly excluded from madrone sprout stands following disturbance (9), in spite of a leaf canopy that is more open than that of tanoak and giant chinkapin (Castanopsis chrysophyl1a) (16). New information is available for forecasting site occupancy of Pacific madrone for up to 6 years after disturbance. It includes equations that relate width and area of sprout clumps originating from trees greater than 1 inch d.b.h. to size of parent stem and time since cutting (28), and equations that predict potential leaf area and biomass by parent tree diameter class (7). Growth and Yield- Most of the Pacific madrone trees observed originate from sprouts, and their growth and form are influenced thereby. Position of the sprout in the clump, for example, often governs form. Members in the center of the clump grow straighter than those on the edge, which tend to lean outward or be J-shaped. In general, trees in the crowded forest have better form and are less branchy than those in the open. Madrone usually is a stately tree, tall and straight of bole if on good sites in forested canyons and draws (fig. 3). But the species frequently is low and shrubby with multiple stems, if on poor sites, especially on south-facing benches and ridges. Growth of madrone has been described as slow, especially in diameter (27). In the northern Sierra Nevada on good sites, madrone trees average 5 to 6 rings per centimeter (12 to 15 rings/in) of diameter (12). Here, stand density of mixed hardwoods, which include California black oak and tanoak, as well as Pacific madrone, averages 1,630, stems per hectare (659 per acre), more than 5 cm (2 in) in d.b.h., and 45.5 m²/ha (198 ft²/acre) of basal area. As madrone generally grows in dense stands, this growth rate is probably typical of trees 55 to 65 years of age on similar sites. The relationship of d.b.h. to total tree height for madrone in the northern Sierra Nevada is curvilinear. Although fitted freehand, the curve indicates that trees 20 cm (8 in) in diameter are about 15 in (49 ft) tall; those 40 cm (16 in), 23 in (75 ft) tall; and trees 60 cm (24 in) in diameter are almost 28 in (92 ft) in height. -Diameter-height relationship of Pacific madrone in north-central California. When dense stands in the Sierra Nevada were given a crown thinning that reduced basal area by 34 to 55 percent, early analyses showed that diameter growth on thinned plots was more than twice that of the control plot: 23 mm per tree compared to 10 mm (0.9 to 0.4 in) after 8 years. In thinned plots and control, diameter growth of trees was successively better as crown class increased from suppressed to dominant. Preliminary trends indicated that stands thinned below 25.3 m²/ha (110 ft² /acre) of basal area were too open and probably too warm for best diameter growth (13). The higher density level where growth decreased from overcrowding has not been defined. Although the longevity of madrone is not known, the species has been referred to as ""giving evidence of being long lived"" (27). Trees 200 to 250 years old have been recorded and large specimens are estimated to be 400 to 500 years old. Madrone seldom exceeds 34 m (110 ft) in height and 152 cm (60 in) in breast-height diameter. The largest Pacific madrone on record grows in Humboldt County, CA, and is 24 m (79 ft) tall and over 975 cm (384 in) in circumference 0.9 m (3 ft) above ground (19). Volume per hectare of madrone generally is low because the species seldom grows in pure stands. In the 60-year-old mixed-hardwood stand in the northern Sierra Nevada, Pacific madrone constituted nearly 16 percent of total stand volume of 44.7 m/ha (638 W/acre). Rooting Habit- Two- to 5-year-old madrone seedlings, growing in partial shade, showed large variation in root pattern and length. Some seedlings had a curving, twisting primary root with moderately extensive lateral development, and others had moderately twisted primary roots just below groundline that straightened and grew downward for about 23 cm (9 in). Trees 50 to 60 years old often have a well-developed root burl from which a spreading root system develops. Some of these roots extend into organic layers near the soil surface and others slant downward. Large trees, 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h., can produce massive root burls 122 to 152 cm (48 to 60 in) in diameter. Uprooted trees indicate a system composed of deep, spreading lateral roots. Reaction to Competition- Young Pacific madrone seedlings need partial shade for establishment, especially in the southern portion of their range. As trees age, the need for light increases and older trees require top light for survival. In British Columbia, the species has a low shade tolerance. An appropriate overall classification for the species is intermediate in tolerance to shade. Pacific madrone probably is more subclimax than climax in successional status. Damaging Agents- Fire is a major damaging agent to thin-barked madrone. Even the thicker bark at the base of old trees shields them little. Seedlings, sprouts, and trees all die back to the root crown after fire, but rarely are killed. Competing conifers usually are damaged badly or killed, however, allowing the fast-growing madrone sprouts to establish dominance. Animal damage to Pacific madrone is minor. Deer eat berries and browse tender shoots of low crowns and young trees. Insect damage is minor, and not economically significant. Several types of insects cause minor damage, including defoliators, leaf miners, wood borers, and bark beetles (5). One of the most commonly observed types of damage on madrone leaves is the sinuous track of the larva of Marmara arbutiella. Damage, however, is relatively minor. The fall webworm. (Hyphantria cunea) commonly deforms young trees and sprouts. The pathology of Pacific madrone is characterized by many leaf spots, one leaf rust, a spot anthracnose, a tar spot, at least four cankers, and a root disease. A major cause of dieback and death of Pacific madrone is Fusicoccum aesculi (asexual stage), Botryosphaeria dothidea (sexual stage), which presently is virulent in northern California. This fungus disease, known as ""madrone canker,"" begins on branch tips and moves inward. Symptoms of the disease are a dieback of branch tips followed by a dark wine-red discoloration of the bark that turns black after the branch dies. Continued advance of the infection leads to a wedge-shaped canker that eventually encircles and kills the branch. The blackened surface of the dead branch looks like fire damage. Cankered areas often spread from branches to bole and expand into the heartwood of the tree. Twigs, branches, and whole trees can be killed by this canker. Occasionally, branch dieback stops at a node. Sometimes several members of a sprout clump die back and sometimes all the sprouts in a clump succumb. Spores produced in the outer bark are probably spread by rain and wind, and also by insects (10). The disease probably was widespread and causing insignificant damage in forest stands, but has become a serious problem over the past 10-12 years. Changing environmental conditions are thought to have encouraged the outbreak of this disease. This pest has been reported as damaging Pacific madrone in the northern half of its range in California and has been observed in Oregon and Washington. The common twig fungus (Botryosphaeria ribis) infects madrone but is not common. A serious disease of madrone is a canker (Phytophthora cactorum) that can affect its culture in occasional situations. Cankers of this species appear to originate at ground-line and spread up the bole for an unknown distance. Early symptoms are browning and death of new leaves and a thinning of the crown. By the time these symptoms are obvious, extensive basal cankering usually has taken place (8). Another canker (Hendersonula toruloidea) is fairly widespread on madrone in British Columbia. Annosus root rot (Heterobasidion annosum), which killed more than 100 trees in Amador County, CA, in 1976, is a pest of high potential damage (1). Several species of fungi cause serious damage to the heartwood of madrone trees. The most important are Phellinus igniarius, Fomitopsis cajanderi (Fomes subroseus), and Poria subacida. In the mixed conifer-hardwood forest of northwestern California, living madrones with fungus-infected heartwood are heavily utilized by cavity-nesting birds (21).",Life History,Pacific Madrone,arbutus,menziesii,hardwood,10,0
"Wood of Pacific madrone is moderately dense and strong, and extremely hard. When dry, its color, grain, and figure resemble that of black cherry. It is especially handsome in rotary-cut veneer (18). The wood is well suited for use as bobbins, shuttles, novelties, and tobacco pipes and is recommended for furniture, paneling, flooring, interior trim, charcoal, and odor-free food-storage units (32). Early Californians preferred madrone charcoal over that from other species for manufacturing gunpowder. Nearly all of the products mentioned have been manufactured in the past. Current utilization is for some of these products as well as fuelwood. The smooth reddish-orange bark of trunk and limbs, shiny green leaves, and colorful berries have led to use of madrone as an ornamental.",Special Uses,Pacific Madrone,arbutus,menziesii,hardwood,16,0
"Western hemlock is a common associate throughout most of the range of Pacific silver fir, in the Abies amabilis zone and portions of the Tsuga heterophylla zone (9). Noble fir (Abies procera) is an important associate in southern Washington and northern Oregon. Other associates west of the Cascade Range are Douglas-fir, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and grand fir (Abies grandis), with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) important near the coast. At subalpine elevations in the Tsuga mertensiana zone (9), Pacific silver fir is associated with mountain hemlock, Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Toward the eastern limits of its range, it grows with a mixture of coastal and interior species: western larch (Larix occidentalis), western white pine (Pinus monticola), lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, grand fir, and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis) is an associate in the extreme southern portion of its range. Extensive pure stands of Pacific silver fir have been reported in the Mount Baker and Mount Rainier regions and elsewhere in the southern Washington Cascade Range (40). Pacific silver fir is a major species in the forest cover type Coastal True Fir-Hemlock (Society of American Foresters Type 226) (5). It is also found in the following types: 205 Mountain Hemlock 206 Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir 223 Sitka Spruce 224 Western Hemlock 225 Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce 227 Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock 228 Western Redcedar 229 Pacific Douglas-Fir 230 Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock Shrubs associated with Pacific silver fir are primarily ericaceous. Blueleaf huckleberry (Vaccinium deliciosum), Cascades azalea (Rhododendron albiflorum), and rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea) are common understory species at higher elevations; copper bush (Cladothamnus pyrolaeflorus) is important in subalpine British Columbia (2). Alaska huckleberry (Vaccinium alaskaense), big huckleberry (V. membranaceum), ovalleaf huckleberry (V. ovalifolium), and devilsclub (Oplopanax horridum) are widespread associates. At its lower limits of elevation, Pacific silver fir is found with salal (Gaultheria shallon) and Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa). Common herbaceous associates are common beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), queenscup (Clintonia uniflora), dwarf blackberry (Rubus lasiococcus), strawberryleaf blackberry (R. pedatus), rosy twistedstalk (Streptopus roseus), coolwort foamflower (Tiarella unifoliata), and deerfern (Blechnum spicant). Rhytidiopis robusta is a constant bryophyte associate. Major habitat types include Abies amabilis-Tsuga mertensiana/Vaccinium membranaceum-Rhododendron albiflorum on cold, wet sites at high elevations and Abies amabilis/Xerophyllum tenax on shallow coarse-textured soils at various elevations. Abies amabilis / Vaccinium alaskaense is a widespread type on modal sites. Abies amabilis/Rubus lasiococcus, Abies amabilis/Streptopus roseus, Abies amabilis / Tiarella unifoliata, and Tsuga heterophylla-Abies amabilis/Blechnum spicant are herb-dominated types found in moist habitats. The Abies amabilis / Oplopanax horridum type occupies wet, alluvial habitats (2,9).",Associated Forest Cover,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,1,1
"Climate throughout the range of Pacific silver fir is distinctly maritime. Summers are cool, with mean daily temperatures of 13° to 16° C (55° to 61° F), and winter temperatures are seldom lower than -9° C (16° F) (35). Mean number of frost-free days ranges from 40 near tree line to more than 250 at low elevations (26). Length of growing season also differs from year to year at a given location. Mean annual precipitation varies greatly, ranging from 6650 mm (262 in) on the west coast of Vancouver Island to an extreme low of 965 mm (38 in) on the eastern side of Vancouver Island. Average annual precipitation in the Cascade Range is more than 1500 mm (59 in); winter snowpacks are as much as 7.6 m (25 ft) deep (9). A summer dry season is characteristic of this region, but Pacific silver fir is dependent on adequate soil moisture during the growing season. It is most abundant on sites where summer drought is minimal, such as areas of heavy rainfall, seepage, or prolonged snowmelt.",Climate,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,2,1
"Despite its extensive range, Pacific silver fir is not a highly variable species. Cortical oleoresin analyses of sample trees from northern California to the Alaska border revealed no chemical variants, and variation among populations was similar to that within populations (51). Similar results were obtained from analyses of bark blister and leaf and twig oils. No artificial hybrids of Pacific silver fir and any other species have been described. It does not hybridize with any of its true fir associates even though pollen shedding and cone receptivity periods may overlap in some localities (7). Some morphological intermediates of Pacific silver fir and subalpine fir have been described, but these proved not to be hybrids (36). The only known cultivated variety of Pacific silver fir is Abies amabilis var. compacta, a dwarf form that has current branches 2 to 3 cm (0.8 to 1.2 in) long.",Genetics,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,7,1
"Pacific silver fir is found in southeastern Alaska, in coastal British Columbia and Vancouver Island, and along the western and upper eastern slopes of the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon. It also grows throughout the Olympic Mountains and sporadically in the Coast Ranges of Washington and northern Oregon. Near Crater Lake, OR, Pacific silver fir disappears from the Cascade Range and then reappears at a few locations in the Klamath Mountains of northwestern California. The major portion of its range lies between latitudes 43° and 55° N. (35). - The native range of Pacific silver fir.",Native Range,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pacific silver fir is monoecious; self-fertilization is possible because times of pollen dispersal and seed cone receptivity overlap on the same tree. Flowers differentiate from axillary buds of current-year lateral shoots in early July of the year before seed development (32). When receptive to pollination, the seed cones appear purple, erect, and 8 to 16 cm (3 to 6 in) tall on the upper surfaces of 1-year-old branches in the upper parts of tree crowns. Just before pollination, the pollen cones appear red, pendent, and usually abundant on the lower surfaces of the branches somewhat lower on the crowns than the seed cones. Cone buds burst the following May, and pollination occurs about 2 weeks later-before vegetative bud burst. The pollen does not germinate and begin forming its pollen tube until 4 to 5 weeks later, resulting in a 6-week delay between pollination and fertilization (7,33). Initiation of phenological events varies with latitude, altitude, aspect, weather, and snowpack and is apparently related to mean soil and air temperatures. For example, pollination may occur in mid-May at 900 m (2,960 ft) in central Washington but is delayed until mid-June at 1600 m (5,250 ft) and until late May in southern British Columbia (7,32,33). Seeds are fully mature in late August, and dissemination begins in mid-September- one of the earliest dispersal times for Pacific Northwest conifers. Initiation of dispersal is apparently independent of altitude or latitude (7); most seeds are shed by the end of October but may be shed until the following April (21,33). Seed Production and Dissemination- Cone production begins at years 20 to 30 (33,37). Good seed years vary from region to region; a good seed crop generally occurs every 3 years (8). Pacific silver fir is not considered a good seed producer; this condition is attributed to frequent years of low pollen, the extended period between pollination and fertilization, and archegonial abortion producing empty seeds (33). Percentage of sound seed varies, with reports of 6.7 to 35 percent and 51 percent in one location (4). Germinative capacity varies widely from 3 to 70 percent- but averages 20 to 30 percent. Cleaned seeds range from 17,200 to 45,860/kg (7,800 to 20,800/lb) (37). The seeds are heavier than seeds of most Pacific Northwest conifers except noble fir. Seeds each contain a single wing but often fall from the upright cone axis by pairs on ovuliferous scales, as the bracts contort and tear themselves from the cone-a process that does not require wind. When the seeds are dispersed by the wind, they do not carry far; unsound seeds are carried farther than sound seeds. In one study, only 9 percent of the sound seeds were found more than 114 m (375 ft) from the stand edge, compared with 41 percent at the stand edge and 34 percent more than 38 m (125 ft) (4). Seedling Development- Pacific silver fir germinates in the spring after overwintering under snow. Germination is epigeal (37). Seedlings germinating on snow because of early snowfall or late seed fall are generally short lived. Germination can occur on a variety of media: on litter humps and in moist depressions in the subalpine zone; on edges of melting snowpack in subalpine meadows; and in litter, rotten wood, moss, organic soils, mineral soils, and fresh volcanic tephra (2,11,25). Survival is better on mineral seedbeds than on organic seedbeds. Early mortality of seedlings is attributable more to germination on snow, adverse climatic effects, and competing vegetation than to disease (18). Cool, moist habitats are best for germination, but full sunlight produces maximum subsequent growth. Seedlings can also grow under dense shade; seedlings 8 to 12 years old and about 10 cm (4 in) tall can frequently be found beneath older, closed forest canopies. Seedlings that survive continue to grow very slowly, existing as advance regeneration that can be 65 to 110 years old and only 45 to 200 cm tall (18 to 80 in). When existing as advance regeneration, Pacific silver fir has flat-topped crowns caused by slow height growth relative to lateral branch growth. Seedlings are sturdy and erect and resist being flattened by litter and heavy, wet snow. Survival of Pacific silver fir as advance regeneration at middle elevations, where western hemlock is primarily found in openings, is attributed partly to its ability to resist being buried by litter after snowmelt (40). At the highest elevations, Pacific silver fir is found primarily in openings and less frequently beneath the canopy (38). Stems of seedlings growing on slopes often have a ""pistol-butted"" sweep, caused by heavy snow creeping downhill. Vegetative Reproduction- Although Pacific silver fir can produce epicormic or adventitious sprouts, it does not regenerate by stump sprouting. Upturning of lower branches after tops of young trees are cut may resemble sprouting.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- There is a broad range of height growth rates of Pacific silver fir because of the wide variation of climates with elevation and latitude. Site index values (at 100 years) in southern British Columbia range from 12 to 46 m (40 to 150 ft) (26) and have been negatively correlated with elevation in Washington (16). In subalpine tree clumps at higher elevations, Pacific silver firs reach heights of 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft). The largest Pacific silver fir tree known was in the Olympic National Park, WA. It was 256 cm (101 in) in d.b.h. and 74.7 m (245 ft) tall. Trees 55 to 61 m (180 to 200 ft) tall and more than 60 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. are common in old-growth stands. Trees 500 to 550 years old have been found on Vancouver Island and in the North Cascades National Park, WA. Maximum age reported is 590 years (48). Early height growth from seeds is generally considered very slow; 9 or more years are usually required to reach breast height. Juvenile height growth ranges from 10 to 40 cm (4 to 16 in) per year, depending on length of the growing season (50). Planted seedlings also grow slowly, with height increments of 3 to 15 cm (I to 6 in) for the first few years after planting (47). On productive sites at low elevations, Pacific silver fir is capable of much greater rates, averaging 90 cm (35 in) per year above breast height on some 30-year-old trees (16). Growth of released advance regeneration is more rapid than early growth from seeds (20,49). After an initial lag following overstory removal (as by avalanche, windstorm, or clearcutting), growth rates of 50 cm (20 in) or more per year can occur (49). When released from suppression, advance regeneration trees change from flat-topped to more conical crowns (41). Pacific silver fir occasionally shows an abnormal height growth pattern, in which various sapling and pole-size trees curtail height growth for at least 1 year while adjacent trees grow normally. Causes of this phenomenon are not known. Height-age and site index curves for Pacific silver fir have recently been constructed (23); however, little information on yield of second-growth stands is available. Data from sample plots on a variety of sites (table 1) indicate that large volumes can be expected from Pacific silver fir in pure stands or mixed with hemlocks. Close spacing and lack of taper are partly responsible for high volumes found in pure, even-aged stands of Pacific silver fir. Volume in old-growth stands is extremely variable, depending on the mix of species and degree of stand deterioration. One densely stocked plot at 1100 m (3,600 ft) in the north Cascades had 1813 m³/ha (25,895 ft³/acre), 83 percent Pacific silver fir by volume. An older, more open stand in the same area had 840 m³/ha (12,000 ft³/acre). Stands at upper elevations (predominantly Pacific silver fir) in western Washington carry large amounts of leaf biomass- 18 to 25 t/ha (8 to 11 tons/acre); total standing biomass ranges up to 500 t/ha (223 tons/acre) in mature and older forests. Leaf area indexes of 14 have been reported (14). A large proportion of the net primary production is below ground in subalpine stands; this is apparently a characteristic of the cool sites and low nutrient mobilization rates rather than the species itself. Values of net primary production in two upper elevation Pacific silver fir stands in western Washington were determined (15). In the 23-year-old stand, total net primary production was 18 000 kg/ha (16,060 lb/acre); in the 180-year-old stand it was 17 000 kg/ha (15,170 lb/acre). Of this, the above-ground portion was 6500 kg/ha (5,800 lb/acre) and 4500 kg/ha (4,010 lb/acre) for the two stands, respectively. Woody growth made up 65 percent of this amount in the younger stand, and 50 percent in the older stand. The below-ground portion was 11 500 kg/ha (10,260 lb/acre) and 12 500 kg/ha (11,150 lb/acre) for the two stands, respectively. Small conifer roots and mycorrhizae made up 65 percent of this amount in the younger stand and 73 percent in the older stand. Rooting Habit- Pacific silver fir seedlings have roots that more closely resemble a true taproot system than do western hemlock seedlings (38), and the roots can penetrate more compact soils than can the roots of western redcedar, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock (27). Seedlings can develop adventitious roots where volcanic tephra covers the original soil surface (1). Advance regeneration has, small root-to-shoot ratios, and the roots are predominantly in the organic layers. Mature Pacific silver fir can have a relatively flat, shallow, platelike root system on poorly drained or shallow soils or in areas where there is nutrient immobilization in the forest floor (15). On soils where podzolization develops and organic matter accumulates, feeding roots become concentrated in organic horizons as a stand ages. Peak growth of seedling roots occurs when shoots are least active. Activity is high in early spring and late autumn even in cold soils. Roots can also be active during the winter when soil temperatures are just above freezing; however, water conductance is dramatically reduced after seedlings are preconditioned to cold temperatures (39). At upper elevations in both young and mature stands, a large proportion of annual biomass production is in the root systems (15). Roots are intensely mycorrhizal at upper elevations, and Cenococcum graniforme is a major mycorrhizal symbiont (45). Reaction to Competition- Pacific silver fir can grow in a variety of stand development conditions. It can seed onto outwash after glacial retreat (35), seed into burned areas, develop from advance regeneration after removal of the overstory, and grow slowly from a suppressed tree into an overstory tree in more uneven-aged stands where disturbances are minor. Advance regeneration may have a cone-shaped crown or can become flat topped, with lateral branch growth greatly exceeding height growth. After extensive removal of the overstory, some (but not all) advance regeneration can accelerate in diameter and height growth and form a new forest (20). Even-aged, pure, or mixed stands vary in stocking but can have more than 2,470 stems per hectare (1,000/acre). When crowns close during the sapling and pole stages, understory vegetation is almost completely eliminated by shade, causing an open forest floor. Lower limbs become shaded and die, creating branchfree boles. This condition may last 200 years (31). Eventually the overstory crowns abrade and let more light into the understory, allowing development of shrubs and advance regeneration. This may occur after one to three centuries-probably depending on site quality, spacing, and disturbance history-and has been observed to last to age 500 years (31). Individual overstory trees eventually die and advance regeneration grows slowly upward, creating a multi-aged, old-growth forest with a major component of Pacific silver fir that will be self-perpetuating, barring a major disturbance. Pacific silver fir is referred to as the climax species at mid-elevations of its range (9) because of its ability to survive in the shade and to emerge in all-aged stands. Because of its slow early height growth, associated species such as western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and noble fir initially overtop Pacific silver fir when grown in the open. After the initial overtopping, on many sites Pacific silver fir appears to outgrow and become taller than western hemlock after 100 years (19). On cool, moist sites at the upper extremes of the range of Douglas-fir, Pacific silver fir can stratify above Douglas-fir as well (40). Noble fir appears to maintain a height advantage over Pacific silver fir indefinitely on all sites where both species grow. Pacific silver fir is one of the most shade-tolerant trees in the Northwest. There is confusion regarding its relative shade tolerance compared with western hemlock. It has been described as equal, greater, and less shade tolerant than hemlock (26,40). It can most accurately be classed as very tolerant of shade. Most silvicultural treatments of Pacific silver fir have dealt with regeneration and early stocking levels after old-growth stands were logged. Regeneration practices vary from clearcutting followed by burning and planting to clearcutting with reliance on natural advance and postlogging regeneration. Each practice successfully obtains regeneration for certain sites and management regimes. Early stocking control-thinning sapling and pole-size trees to 495 to 740/ha (200 to 300/acre)- is practiced to increase growth rates of individual trees. Trees left in pole-size stands after thinning markedly increase in diameter growth and apparently respond to fertilization. Possible commercial thinning regimes, rotation ages, and regeneration plans for managed stands (where advance regeneration may not be prevalent) are primarily in the planning stages. Young, post-harvest stands can develop densely from advance regeneration. These stands may require thinning to maintain diameter growth, to keep from buckling in heavy snow or wind, and to ensure advance regeneration before the next harvest. Damaging Agents- Pacific silver fir is easily killed by fire because of its shallow rooting habit and thin bark. It has lower resistance to windthrow than Douglas-fir, western hemlock, or western redcedar. It is susceptible to windthrow after heavy partial cuts (9), on the borders of clearcuts or partial cuts, and even in closed canopy stands during strong winds. Resistance to breakage from snow and damage by frost is moderate. The foliage of Abies amabilis and other true firs is more easily damaged by volcanic tephra than is the foliage of associated conifers (22). Several types of animal damage have been reported: heavy browsing by Roosevelt elk (34), bark stripping by bears in pole-size stands, clipping of terminal buds by grouse and rodents (13), and cutting of cones and cone buds by squirrels. Pacific silver fir is susceptible to many types of insect damage. Seed chalcids (Megastigmus pinus and M. lasiocarpae) and cone maggots (Earomyia abietum) have been known to infest a high proportion of cones during good seed years (17). Western hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria lugubrosa) and western blackheaded budworm (Acleris gloverana) are serious defoliators of mixed Pacific silver fir and western hemlock stands in British Columbia. Many other loopers are of minor importance; two species that cause periodic outbreaks the greenstriped forest looper (Melanolophia imitata) and saddleback looper (Ectropis crepuscularia). The western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) also feeds on Pacific silver fir in pure and mixed stands. The silver fir beetle (Pseudohylesinus sericeus) and fir root bark beetle (P. granulatus) can be very destructive together and in combination with the root rotting fungi Armillaria mellea, Heterobasidion annosum, Phellinus weiri, and Poria subacida. The last major outbreak of silver fir beetles lasted from 1947 to 1955; it killed 2.5 million m³ (88 million ft³) of timber in Washington (12). An imported pest, the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae), is the most devastating killer of Pacific silver fir. Attacks on the crown by this insect result in swelling or ""gouting"" of branch nodes, loss of needles, and reduced growth for many years; attacks on the stem usually cause a tree to die within 3 years. Trees of all ages and vigor are susceptible, although some individuals seem to have natural resistance. In southern Washington, damage has been heavy on high-quality sites at low elevations, such as benches and valley bottoms (28). In British Columbia, heaviest damage is on similar sites below 610 m (2,000 ft). Pacific silver firs growing with subalpine firs at high elevations are relatively immune and suffer only temporary gouting. Spread of the aphid has been slow since the major outbreak of 1950-57, but infested areas remain a problem. No effective direct control methods have been found for forest stands. Pacific silver fir is a secondary host for hemlock dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense) and can be infected in mixed stands containing western or mountain hemlock. A. abietinum also attacks Pacific silver fir and western hemlock; it is more common in central Oregon in the Cascade Range. Needle casts (Lophodermium uncinatum, Phaeocryptopus nudus, Virgella robusta) and rusts (Uredinopsis spp.) are common on reproduction in some localities in British Columbia. Thinning studies on the west coast of Vancouver Island indicated that Pacific silver fir is more susceptible to Heterobasidion annosum root and butt rots than are western hemlock, Douglas-fir, or Sitka spruce. Airborne infection of Pacific silver fir stumps was not seasonal as in other species, and infection rates were high throughout the year (29). Pacific silver fir is also one of the Northwest conifers most susceptible to laminated root rot (Phellinus weiri) (27) and shoestring rot (Armillaria mellea). Overmature Pacific silver firs are highly prone to heart rot, primarily by the Indian paint fungus (Echinodontium tinctorium) and the bleeding conk fungus (Haematostereum sanguinolentum). In British Columbia, Pacific silver firs were free of decay to age 75; then incidence increased with age to 11 percent at 275 years, 40 percent at 375 years, and 100 percent in trees more than 400 years (6). Released advance regeneration scarred by logging is rarely infected by heart rot fungi. In one instance, E. tinctorium was nearly absent in young stands 30 years after release, even though adjacent unlogged stands were heavily infected. Lack of suitable branch stubs for entry by fungi and rapid closing of wounds because of accelerated growth are believed to prevent infection (20). Deterioration is rapid after logging, windthrow, or death caused by insects or diseases. Within 5 years of death, loss in cubic volume can be from 50 to 100 percent. Primary decay fungi on dead wood are Fomitopsis pinicola, Ganoderma applanatum, Hirschioporus abietinus, and Poria subacida.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,14,1
"Pacific silver fir grows on soils developed from nearly every type of parent material found in the Northwest. Layering in soil profiles caused by successive deposits of volcanic ejecta, colluvium, or glacial till is especially common (1,43). The greatest known growth rates for Pacific silver fir occur at low elevations on fine-textured residual soils from sedimentary and basaltic rocks (16). Growth is reduced on poorly drained or shallow rocky soils. In northern Washington and British Columbia, podzolization is the dominant process in well-drained soils under Pacific silver fir. A typical podzol is characterized by strong acidity of organic (pH 3.3 to 4.0) and mineral horizons, moderate to thick (3 to 45 cm; 1 to 18 in) surface accumulations of organic matter, and moderate to extremely low base saturation. In Oregon, podzolization is less strongly expressed and soils are more shallow and rocky. Pacific silver fir has been found on many soil suborders throughout its range: Folists in the order Histosols; Aquents, Fluvents, Orthents in the order Entisols; Andepts, Aquepts, Ochrepts, Umbrepts in the order Inceptisols; and Aquods, Humods, and Orthods in the order Spodosols (35). At upper elevations in Washington, soils beneath Pacific silver fir stands are generally low in available nitrogen, with availability decreasing with age (44). External nutrient cycling is slow; a mean nitrogen residence time as long as 120 years has been found in old-growth forest floors (24). Nitrification has not been found to occur. Availability of phosphorus tends to be low but availability of base elements does not appear to limit plant growth (42). Internal cycling meets much of the annual nutrient requirements. Foliar nitrogen concentrations between 0.7 and 1.2 percent and foliar phosphorus concentrations of 0.11 to 0.20 percent have been reported (3,42,52). Pacific silver fir differs significantly from western hemlock in its ability to accumulate specific elements (46). Pacific silver fir grows at sea level along the coast from Alaska to the Olympic Peninsula; farther inland, it is absent at lower elevations. Its range in elevation is narrowest in Alaska, 0 to 300 m (0 to 1,000 ft), and greatest in the western Cascade Range of Washington, where Pacific silver fir may be found from 240 to 1830 m (800 to 6,000 ft). In British Columbia it is found from 0 to 1525 m (0 to 5,000 ft) in elevation on western Vancouver Island and from 180 to more than 1680 m (600 to more than 5,500 ft) on the lower mainland. Pacific silver fir grows on the highest ridges and peaks in the Coast Ranges of Washington, from 365 to 850 m (1,200 to 2,800 ft). In the Olympic Mountains, it is the predominant montane species up to 1400 m (4,600 ft), with lower limits at sea level on the west side and at 360 m (1,200 ft) in the central mountains. It is found between 610 and 1830 m (2,000 and 6,000 ft) in the Cascade Range in Oregon as far south as the divide between the Rogue and Umpqua Rivers. On the east side of the Cascade Range, it is confined to high elevations, down to 1160 m (3,800 ft) in Oregon and 1000 m (3,300 ft) in Washington (30,35).",Soils and Topography,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,15,1
"Pacific silver fir is marketed with western hemlock and is typically used for construction framing, subflooring, and sheathing. It is commonly used for construction plywood even though it is not as strong as Douglas-fir. Because of its light color and lack of odor, gum, and resin, Pacific silver fir is well suited for container veneer and plywood. It is occasionally used for interior finish and is suitable for poles. Good yields of strong pulp can be produced by both mechanical and chemical processes. It is a minor Christmas tree species, and its boughs are occasionally used for decorative greenery. Because Pacific silver fir is common on midslopes of the Cascade Range, it is a large component of many municipal watersheds, wilderness areas, and recreation areas. Its beauty and ability to withstand or respond to human impact make it a suitable species for multiple-use management.",Special Uses,Pacific Silver Fir,abies,amabilis,conifer,16,1
"Pacific yew commonly occurs as an understory species in several forest cover types. It is a major component in some stands, but in most it is minor to rare. In some types, it tends to be found mostly on microsites. Some examples: In stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), grand fir (Abies grandis), and western larch (Larix occidentalis) in the drier interior forests, yew is found in moist areas near streams and springs (but on well drained soil); on wet, hummocky sites west of the Cascades, yew can be found in Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana)-Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia) stands (ash occupies the low, wet spots and yew grows with the oak on slightly raised hummocks); scattered large yew trees grow along the Clackamas River in northwest Oregon on berms and banks between first and second bottomlands in stands of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), red alder (Alnus rubra), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), crab apple (Malus spp.), and willow (Salix spp.) (3,47). By far, Pacific yew is most common in dense conifer forests. Among the major Society of American Foresters (16) cover types in which Pacific yew is found are: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (206), Interior Douglas-Fir (210), White Fir (211), Grand Fir (213), Black Cottonwood-Willow (222), Western Hemlock (224), Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock (227), Western Redcedar (228), Pacific Douglas-Fir (229), Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock (230), Port-Orford-Cedar (231), Redwood (232), Oregon White Oak (233), Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (234), Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (243), and Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (244) (4,8,11,17,24,25,35,45,47). In western Oregon, Douglas-fir was present on 89 percent of the forest inventory plots in which yew was tallied. A list of plants found most frequently with Pacific yew on these plots (table 1) indicates the broad range of conditions to which the species can adapt.",Associated Forest Cover,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,1,1
"Pacific yew is found over a wide range of moisture and temperature conditions (8,11,19,35,40,44). In dry, subhumid areas with an average annual precipitation as low as 470 mm (19 in), it is confined to streamside areas and the lower third of north-facing slopes. Some large specimens can be found in such environments; for example, the largest known yew tree in Idaho- 84.8 cm (33.4 in) d.b.h. and 8.5 m (28 ft) tall- is at the bottom of Hell's Canyon in an area that receives about 500 mm (20 in) of precipitation annually (21). On the Queen Charlotte Islands, Pacific yew is confined to the borders of inlets (44). Throughout much of its range within humid and superhumid forests (precipitation of 1400 to 4000 mm [55 to 157 in]), it can be found on all slopes, benches, and ridgetops. For example, a large yew tree in Oxbow County Park near Troutdale, Oregon (precipitation about 1450 mm [57 in]), is on the highest point in the park, a 210-m (690-ft) ridge overlooking the Sandy River 168 m (550 ft) below (3). Pacific yew is found from sea level in coastal areas to 2440 m (8,000 ft) in the Sierra Nevada. Length of growing season ranges from 60 to 300 days, with annual minimum temperatures from -15° to -12° C (5° to 10° F) (4,8,11,24,25,35,45).",Climate,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,2,1
"Pacific yew occurs in nature as a shrub or a tree, but whether the two forms are distinct subspecies, races, or varieties is not known. Three cultivars have been reported: cv erecta, a columnar form; cv nana, a dwarf form; and cv nutallii, a drooping form. A hybrid between Taxus brevifolia and T. cuspidata (Japanese yew) has been reported, but has no botanical standing. Pacific yew was originally classified as a variety of T. baccata (European yew), which it closely resembles; some botanists grouped all seven of the currently recognized species of Taxus worldwide as varieties of T. baccata. Where different species grow near each other, interspecific hybrids frequently occur, lending support to the view that there is but one species (13,22,23,34,44). Further evidence of the close similarity of the species of Taxus is provided by bark analyses which show that most species contain taxol (9), and by an analysis of heartwood constituents of T. baccata, T. brevifolia, T. cuspidata, and T. floridana:the four species were found to be ""chemically almost indistinguishable"" (15)",Genetics,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,7,1
"Pacific yew grows in forests from the southern tip of southeast Alaska- including Annette and Prince of Wales Island- south through the Pacific Coast region of British Columbia, Vancouver and the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. It is rare in the Coast Range south of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington and north of the Umpqua River in Oregon, but occurs with greater frequency in the Coast Range in southern Oregon and northern California. Isolated occurrences are found as far south as Marin and San Mateo Counties in California. Yew occurs in scattered localities in the valleys between the Coast Range and Cascade Ranges of Oregon and Washington. In the Cascade Range, it is fairly common at low to moderate elevations, and on some sites in southern Oregon it is abundant. Pacific yew extends south through the Klamath Mountains of California, then southeasterly to the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Its southern limit is in Calaveras County. Farther inland, it grows on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, south into northern Idaho and western Montana, the Lewis Range in Montana, and isolated areas in eastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. In the South Fork of the Clearwater River basin in Idaho, Pacific yew deviates from its role as a minor forest component and becomes a dominant on about 16 000 hectares (40,000 acres) (8,19,20,27,30,31,35,40,42,43, 44,47,49). - The native range of Pacific yew.",Native Range,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pacific yew is dioecious. Male strobili are stalked, bud-like, pale yellow, and composed of 6 to 12 filamentous stamens, each with 5 to 9 anthers. They are abundant on the underside of branch sprays and usually appear in May or June. Female strobili are less abundant, greenish, and composed of several scales. They also are borne on the underside of branches. The fruit is an ovoid-oblong seed about 8 mm (0.3 in) long, partially enveloped by a fleshy, berrylike, scarlet, cup-shaped disk called an aril. Pollen is dispersed by wind in the spring (6,11,19,22). Seed Production and Dissemination- Fruits ripen from August to October of the same year that flowering occurs. Fruits either drop to the ground or are taken from trees by birds or rodents. Birds devour the fleshy arils and void the seeds which remain viable. Chipmunks and squirrels often take only the seeds. Rodents and some birds-nuthatches, for example-cache yew seeds, thus creating the clusters of yew seedlings observed in some areas (11). The seed is about 6 mm (0.24 in) long with a depressed hilum, bony inner coat, and membranous outer seedcoat. Pacific yew is a prolific seeder (19,43). Seeds average about 33,100/kg (15,000/1b) after cleaning (39). The frequency of good seed crops is unknown. Seedling Development- Seeds of Pacific yew germinate slowly and require stratification. Germination tests indicate that 30° C (86° F) day and 20° C (68° F) night temperatures are desirable (11,19,43). Germination is epigeal, and usually in heavy organic matter. In a study in Idaho, wild yew seedlings were distributed in seedbeds as follows (1l): Yew seeds sown in nursery beds in late spring require mulching. Beds require shading during the summer and again in December. Some seeds do not germinate until the second spring after sowing (39). Vegetative Reproduction- Pacific yew is capable of layering and often sprouts from stumps or rootstocks after the top has been killed or the tree cut (3,11,23,44). Layering usually occurs after branches or tree tops have been pressed to the ground for a prolonged period by large fallen trees or limbs (11), although occasional old yew trees can be found surrounded by a ring of well rooted branches that were apparently held down only by their own weight and the weight of snow in the winter. Although Pacific yew is sensitive to heat (11,26,44), sprouts that originated from the bases of burned stumps were reported from the Rogue River National Forest in southern Oregon (23). Young yew trees that originated by layering and sprouting were observed in a sunny, south-facing clearcut on the Mount Hood National Forest in northern Oregon. From one cut yew tree with a stump diameter of 30 cm (12 in), seven new trees had originated by layering before cutting, and a clump of vigorous stump sprouts had originated after cutting. Sprouts emerged from one side of the 36-cm-high (14 in) stump (the opposite side had been debarked during logging) from ground level to the top. The layers were 1.0 m to 2.5 m (3 ft to 8 ft) from the stump. Most of the layers had been damaged by logging and lacked the vigor of the stump sprouts (3).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Pacific yew, unlike most woody plants that grow in heavily shaded forest understories, often has a straight bole. Although yew trees are reported to have typically fluted, ridged, and asymmetrical trunks, often with tightly spiraled grain (6,11,23,37,44), yew cutters in southwest Oregon reported that many yew trunks were round and unfluted above the base section, and straight-grained (7). Large limbs are common in the mid and upper bole. The crown tends to be ragged and lopsided. Pacific yew ""reaches"" for light by way of limbs that may be as long as the tree is tall. Young trees often have an umbrella-shaped crown of flat branches, and old trees have long drooping spray-like branches. Pacific yew is sometimes shrub-like, forming dense thickets. In western Montana, parts of Idaho, northeastern California, the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, and at high elevations throughout its range, the shrub form of yew often occurs in the absence of tree-size specimens (3,8,10,11,20,27,30,31,35,44,49,50). In other areas, large tree-size yews may occasionally be found in or near yew shrub thickets (3). Whether the differences in size and form are genetic traits or the results of environment and stand history is not known. The needles of Pacific yew are dark green on the underside, two ranked, and spirally arranged on twigs. The bark is purplish, papery thin, and scalelike. New bark is rose red (6,19,22,40). The wood is fine grained, hard, and heavy: at 712 kg/m³ (about 44 lb/ft³) (8 percent moisture content), it is the heaviest of U.S. conifers, comparable in weight to high-density hardwoods such as ash, oak, and hard maple (46). Heartwood is red to brownish red, and sapwood is whitish yellow to bright yellow. Pacific yew grows slowly, taking about the same time to grow to 30 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. as other conifers in the same stand take to grow to several times that size. Height growth is correspondingly slow. Trees larger than 50 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. and taller than 12 m (40 ft) are rare within most of the species' range: they account for less than 2 percent of the yew trees tallied on inventory plots on non-Federal land in California, Oregon, and Washington. The following tabulation shows average height by diameter class as determined from 55 Pacific yew trees randomly selected in Oregon and Washington (47): Because of the slow growth of individual trees and because the species is typically found as an occasional tree in stands of other tree species, volumes and yields of Pacific yew are low. Stands with 125 yew trees/ha (50/acre) that are 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. and larger have been observed, but always in association with other species (3). The theoretical volume of yew wood in such stands could be as much as 140 m³/ha (2,000 ft³/acre), including the volume in main stems from ground level to tip. The greatest volume of Pacific yew found in randomly located plots on non-Federal land in California, Oregon, and Washington was 28 m³/ha (400 ft³/acre) (47). These are gross volume estimates. Because heart rot is prevalent in large yew trees, net volume would be considerably less. In Idaho, analyses of increment cores and stem sections of yew trees from mature stands showed annual growth in diameter at 15 cm (6 in) above ground to range from 0.05 cm (0.02 in) to 0.25 cm (0.10 in). The following tabulation shows diameters by age class (1l): The largest known Pacific yew tree is found in a cool, moist valley in western Washington (28). Large yew trees are, however, more prevalent on somewhat drier sites with warm, moist winters. Forty-seven percent of all the yew trees larger than 30 cm (12 in) tallied on inventory plots on non-Federal land in California, Oregon, and Washington were in a 4-county area in southwestern Oregon at mid to low elevations in the drier interior valleys and slopes between the Cascade and Coast Ranges, and in the Klamath Mountains (47). Although Pacific yew is sometimes damaged by heat, frost, and wind, especially after overstory trees have been removed (10 , 11,35,44), it can sometimes respond to release. On permanent plots in western Oregon measured 12 years apart, diameters of undamaged yew trees left after removal of overstory trees grew an average of 0.18 cm/yr (0-07 in/yr) and trees under dense overstories grew 0.06 cm (0.02 in) (47). The adaptation of Pacific yew to overstory removal is made possible through morphological changes in the needles-length, cuticle thickness, and deflection from the horizontal-and development of epicormic twigs (10,11). Rooting Habit- The root system of Pacific yew is deep and wide-spreading (22). Reaction to Competition- Pacific yew is very tolerant of shade (1,11,44). It appears to require shade for establishment and can grow and develop under heavy forest canopies. On many sites, it is able to adapt to overstory removal (10,11), and large, old trees can be found that have been in the open much of their lives (3). Damaging Agents- Pacific yew is sensitive to damage from fire, and, where the overstory has been removed, it is sometimes damaged by exposure to the sun, wind, and cold (10,11,26,35,44). It resists damage from sulfur dioxide and was the least sensitive of 12 coniferous species to smelter fumes at Trail, British Columbia (26). Diseases of Pacific yew seedlings have not been studied, but Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora cinnamoni, and Pythium sp. have caused damping-off and seedling root rot in yews in the East. No serious leaf diseases have been reported. Snow blights- Neopeckia coulteri and Herpotrichia juniperi- have caused localized damage, and four needle blights are caused by Macrophoma taxi, Mycosphaerella taxi, Phoma hystrella, and Sphaerulina taxi. A stem canker is caused by Diplodia taxi, and twig blights by P. hystrella and Physalopspora gregaria. Two root diseases- Armillaria ostoyae (obscura) and Phaeolus schweinitzii have been reported on Pacific yew in Idaho (26). Although seasoned heartwood of Pacific yew is extremely durable, large living Pacific yew trees often have heartrot or hollow boles (11,23). Many of the yew trees over 50 cm (20 in) d.b.h. tallied on non-Federal land in California, Oregon, and Washington could not be bored to determine age because of rotten or hollow trunks (47). Heartrot fungi infecting Pacific yew include Phellinus nigrolimitatus, P. pini, P. robustus, and Fomitopsis rosea (26). Several insects cause damage to yews in the eastern United States, including Lecanium fletcheri (called Fletcher scale or taxus lecanium), Pseudococcus comstocki (Comstock mealybug), Dysmicoccus wistariae, Pseudococcus maritimus (grape mealybug), and Maladera castanea (Asiatic garden beetle) (2). No damage to Pacific yew in forested settings has been confirmed. Reported damage to Pacific yew foliage by budworms (Choristoneura spp.) in areas of heavy budworm infestation is thought to be heat or frost damage resulting from the defoliation of the overstory (5,41).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,14,1
"Pacific yew grows best on deep, moist or rich, rocky or gravelly soils. In dry interior forests, the species develops best along mountain streams, and in shady canyons, ravines, and coves. Within the moist maritime climate of the Pacific Northwest, it grows most abundantly in drier, warmer environments. A partial list of soils on which Pacific yew grows includes those in the orders Ultisols, Alfisols, and Inceptisols (4,11,20,24,25,27,30,37,45,50).",Soils and Topography,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,15,1
"The wood of Pacific yew has been used for archery bows, canoe paddles, tool handles, gunstocks, boat decking, furniture, musical instruments, carved figurines, and miscellaneous novelty items. (In a recent western State gubernatorial election, campaign buttons were made of yew wood.) Japanese have used Pacific yew for ceremonial ""Toko"" poles, which they place next to entrances of their homes (6,19,23,29,44). Pacific yew's resistance to decay makes it useful for fenceposts. Of seven northwest species tested for use as untreated fenceposts, Pacific yew was the second most durable, with an average service life of 25 years (33). In the mid-1980's Japanese purchasers paid $3,600 per thousand board feet (Scribner scale) for Pacific yew logs, mostly for wood carvings. In 1989, Japanese buyers agreed to pay $4,150 per thousand for grade 1 yew logs, and a Taiwanese buyer paid $6,100 (7). Among Native Americans, Saanich Tribal women used Pacific yew to remove underarm hair; Okanagans made a red paint from ground yew wood mixed with fish oil; several tribes smoked dried yew needles, which was said to cause dizziness; Haidas believed that women who ate yew berries would not conceive. Yew was valued as an item of trade and used in making instruments for hunting, fishing, and warring; tools, such as mauls and splitting wedges; household utensils, such as bowls and spoons; and medicine for a broad range of ailments (23,29,44). Pacific yew is again being used for medicinal purposes. In the late 1960's, taxol-a complex compound extracted from yew bark-was identified as a possible anticancer agent (18,48). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has found taxol to be one of the most promising of more than 120,000 plant compounds tested for anticancer properties. Taxol appears to be effective against a wide range of tumors, and good responses have been obtained in the treatment of refractory ovarian cancer (9,38). In 1988, the NCI acquired 27 700 kg (60,000 lb) of dried Pacific yew bark, collected from trees cut down in southwestern Oregon. On average, one yew tree yielded 18 kg (40 lb) of green bark, which weighed about 9 kg (19 lb) dried (7). From the 27 700 kg of dried bark, about 4 kg (9 lb) of dry, crystalline taxol was extracted. Clinicians in several locations across the country have asked for increased supplies of taxol to expand tests to a broader range of cancer types. In January 1989, the NCI solicited another 27 700 kg of yew bark (9). The 27 700 kg of yew bark already collected and the second 27 700 kg ordered represent 6,000 to 7,000 trees. Most of these trees were cut or will be cut on Federal forest land where yew has not been inventoried. On non-Federal lands in California, Oregon, and Washington, where inventories have been made, there are an estimated 700,000 Pacific yew trees 28 cm (11 in) d.b.h. and larger, the size of most trees cut for bark collection. Almost all the yew trees on non-Federal land are survivors of logging operations that removed the old-growth overstory (47). On Federal land where old-growth forests still exist, many more yew trees are thought to be present, but trees of the size needed to produce large quantities of bark are not abundant in most areas. An unknown but unquestionably significant percentage of the original yew resource has already been destroyed in logging. In the process of harvesting Douglas-fir and other timber species, mostly by clearcutting, yew trees were either cut or knocked over and broken up by machinery. Yew trees were seldom taken in primary logging operations, but some yew wood was later salvaged by firewood cutters and gleaners gathering wood for specialty products. Most of the yew trees that existed in logged areas were burned in slash-disposal fires. In many logged areas, the rootstocks have survived and resprouted, so, although the wood and bark of many yew trees were destroyed, there seems to have been little threat to the existence of the yew germ plasm. Continued or increased demand for yew bark for taxol production could further decrease a resource that has already been greatly reduced. Attempts to synthesize taxol in the laboratory have failed, and prospects for success in the future are considered to be poor. The only known source of taxol now is yew bark. Taxol has been found in most of the several other species of Taxus that exist, but Pacific yew is the only one that is considered to be a practical source of quantities sufficient for clinical use (9,12). At least one private organization has begun to investigate alternative ways of producing taxol, through tissue culture and by growing vegetatively propagated seedlings in a controlled environment (7). The several species of yew in both the western and eastern hemispheres are thought to have poisonous seeds and foliage. Incidents of livestock poisoning by yew have been reported in Europe and North America. Conversely, in both Europe and North America, domestic and wild animals are known to browse yew foliage without ill effects. If and under what conditions yew foliage is poisonous are not known (13,14,22,32). Pacific yew is browsed by moose in the South Fork of the Clearwater River basin in Idaho, where the tree is considered critical to the animals' survival (36). Pacific yew is also browsed heavily by elk and occasionally by deer in Oregon and Washington (20,23,30). Sprouts and epicormic branches that form in response to stand disturbance are favored by browsing animals. Repeatedly browsed yews in clearcut areas sometimes develop compact bushy crowns resembling the yew topiary of English gardens. Some limited use of T. brevifolia as an ornamental indicates it also has potential as a shade tree, for hedges, and for topiary (23,44).",Special Uses,Pacific Yew,taxus,brevifolia,conifer,16,1
"Paper birch consists of a large, very plastic gene pool. There are six recognized varieties: typical paper birch (var. papyrifera), western paper birch (var. commutata), mountain paper birch (var. cordifolia), Kenai birch (var. kenaica), Alaska paper birch (var. neoalaskana), and northwestern paper birch (var. subcordata) (58). On the basis of morphological characteristics, seedling growth habits, and chromosome numbers, some authors have suggested that var. cordifolia be reinstated to specific rank as B. cordifolia (13). Chromosome number varies considerably within the species. The somatic chromosome number for typical paper birch can be either 70 or 84, rarely 56. The chromosome number for var. cordifolia is consistently 28, and other varieties may be 42, 56, 70, or 84. Seedlings from the same mother tree typically have two or more chromosome counts (9 through 14, 39). In a comparison of morphological and cytological characteristics of the varieties commutata and subcordata, only bark color was consistently different between the two, suggesting that separate variety names were not justified (11). Within typical paper birch, selections of superior trees have been made on the basis of growth rate, stem form, and other characteristics. In a greenhouse study, seedlings with a plus-tree mother grew significantly taller and larger in basal diameter than trees with ""average"" mothers. Also, sources from New Hampshire were superior to sources from Michigan, Vermont, Maine, or Eastern Canada, in that order (77). Hybridization in the birches is common. Paper birch hybridizes naturally with almost every other native species in the genus (1,16,58,98). The hybrid crosses with yellow (B. alleghaniensis), sweet (B. lenta), and river (B. nigra) birch have not been named. Blue birch (B. x caerulea or x caerulea-grandis) is thought to be a hybrid between grey birch and var. cordifolia (12,39). The variety cordifolia is thought to be a hybrid of paper and yellow birch (58). The named hybrids are crosses between paper birch and shrub or small tree species, as follows: Yukon birch (B. x eastwoodiae Sarg. or B.x commixta Sarg.) with resin birch (B. glandulosa); horne birch (B. x hornei Butler or B. x beeniana A. Nels.) with dwarf arctic birch (B. nana); Sandberg birch (B. x sandbergii Britton or B. x uliginosa Dugle) with bog birch (B. pumila var. glandulifera); and Andrews birch (B. x andrewsii A. Nels. or B. x piperi Britton or B. x utahensis Britton) with water birch (B. occidentalis).",Genetics,Paper Birch,betula,papyrifera,hardwood,7,0
"The range of paper birch closely follows the northern limit of tree growth from Newfoundland and Labrador west across the continent into northwest Alaska; southeast from Kodiak Island in Alaska to British Columbia and Washington; east in the mountains of northeast Oregon, northern Idaho, and western Montana with scattered outliers in the northern Great Plains of Canada, Montana, North Dakota, the Black Hills of South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and the Front Range of Colorado; east in Minnesota and Iowa, through the Great Lakes region into New England. Paper birch also extends down the Appalachian Mountains from central New York to western North Carolina (46,58,97,112). -The native range of paper birch. Paper birch is a northern species adapted to cold climates. Its range is bounded on the north by the 13° C (55° F) July isotherm and in the south, it seldom grows naturally where average July temperatures exceed 21° C (70° F). In Alaska, paper birch is found on the cooler north and east aspects and aspen on the warm south and west aspects. The variety cordifolia in the east generally grows in the cooler habitats-upper elevations on mountains near tree line in the southern part of the range and on cooler north aspects and in depressions toward the northern part of its range. Paper birch tolerates wide variations in the patterns and amounts of precipitation. In Alaska, annual precipitation averages only about 300 mm (12 in); more than half of this as rain in summer and fall. At higher elevations in eastern mountains, precipitation averages as high as 1520 mm (60 in). In general, the climate where paper birch is found has short cool summers and long cold winters during which the ground is covered with snow for long periods (39,46,67,97). As might be expected from its wide range and genetic diversity, paper birch grows on almost any soil and topographic situation ranging from steep rocky outcrops of the mountains to flat muskegs of the boreal forest (Histosols). Best development and growth are on the deeper well-drained to moderately well-drained Spodosols, Inceptisols, and Entisols common to glacial deposits throughout its range. In Alaska, best development occurs on Inceptisols developed on loess deposits. Paper birch was found in all habitats described for the White Mountains of New Hampshire and occurred in 50 percent or more of the plots in six of these habitats. Poorest site-index values were obtained for the driest and wettest sites of the range sampled, whereas higher values were obtained for the moist and nutrient enriched habitats (56). In New England, paper birch tends to be more abundant on the dry sites than on the wet or poorly drained soils (46,63). In Alaska, where paper birch and aspen (Populus tremuloides) occur in mixed stands, birch predominates on the cooler, moister sites, and aspen on the warmer, drier sites. Birch also can be found with black spruce (Picea mariana) on north-facing slopes (67). Typical soil temperatures of birch stands in the Fairbanks region of Alaska range from 9° to ll° C (48° to 52° F) at a 10 cm (4 in) depth during the June to August growing season (112). Paper birch grows best in soils free of shallow permafrost. But on north slopes, vigorous sapling birches have been observed where the annual depth of thaw in permafrost was only 64 to 76 cm (25 to 30 in) (67). Paper birch litter contributes to the nutrient status of the forest floor. When compared with red pine (Pinus resinosa), litter under birch was found to be enriched with calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and boron and reduced in manganese, aluminum, iron, and zinc. Enrichment extended into the top 3 cm (1.2 in) of the mineral soil where concentrations of calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and volatile matter and pH were increased. These increases resulted from the more rapid rate of decomposition of litter under birch than under red pine (93). In Alaska, biomass averaged 60 to 70 t/ha (27 to 31 tons/acre) with an annual litter fall of 4 to 8 t/ha (1.8 to 3.6 tons/acre). In birch stands, rain in the form of throughfall contained from one-half to one-third the calcium and magnesium and twice as much manganese as throughfall under aspen (112). Acidity of precipitation decreased as it passed through crowns of paper birch and other species in New Brunswick, Canada. However, acidity of stemflow increased for paper birch, red pine, white pine, red spruce, and black spruce, where as acidity of sternflow decreased for aspen, red maple, and white spruce (60). Total forest floor biomass and content of magnesium, iron, and manganese were greater and calcium was less under birch than aspen (95). Soils under birch and aspen tend to be warmer but drier than soils under the softwoods. Consequently, C0² production is limited by lack of moisture under these two hardwoods and by low temperature under the conifers (82). Paper birch tolerates fairly high levels (up to 80 mg/l) of aluminum in nutrient solution with no reduction of root growth (64). This tolerance varies significantly among provenances with some tolerating much higher levels (up to 120 mg/l) (90). Radicle elongation of paper birch seed germinated on filter paper treated with I to 5 mg/l of copper, nickel, or cobalt was reduced about 25 percent. Higher concentrations of these elements (up to 100 mg/l) were required for reduction of radicle elongation on mineral or organic soil. Conifer seeds were less sensitive than paper birch to the same treatments (71). Paper birch is a common associate of 39 northern forest types. In the east and central regions, it is a major component of two forest cover types (29): Paper Birch (Society of American Foresters Type 18) and Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir (Type 35). In Alaska and western North America, it is an integral member in three types: Paper Birch (Type 252), White Spruce-Paper Birch (Type 202), and Black Spruce-Paper Birch (Type 254). Paper birch forms either pure stands or mixtures of varying proportions in all regions. Pure stands are generally succeeded by other species (57), but some remnant birch can be maintained in openings in stands of other species thought to be climax for a given locality (47). In other instances, intimate mixtures with long-lasting types are characteristic. On the Laurentian highlands of eastern Canada, aspen and birch stands establish within 30 years following fire. Pure stands of conifers-jack pine or black spruce-follow. As the conifers age and openings occur, paper birch re-enters the stands, becoming a younger component of the mature conifer forests. Fire returns at about 130-year intervals (20). Shrubs commonly associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range are beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), common bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (Diervilla lonicera), wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), raspberries and blackberries (Rubus spp.), American and redberry elder (Sambucus canadensis and S. callicarpa), and hobblebush (Viburnum alnifolium). Shrubs common to the Alaskan interior paper birch type are American green alder (Alnus crispa), Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana), highbush cranberry (Viburnum edule), Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum), raspberry (Rubus spp.), and roses (Rosa spp.).",Habitat,Paper Birch,betula,papyrifera,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Paper birch flowers from mid-April through early June depending on location. The flowers are monoecious (8). In the late summer, staminate flowers are preformed in aments (catkins) 2 to 2.5 cm (0.75 to 1 in) long at the ends of twigs and lateral shoots. These mature and grow in length to 4 to 10 cm (1.5 to 4 in) in the following spring. Pistillate flowers are borne in cylindrical aments (catkins) 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) long and 8 mm (0.33 in) in diameter on the same tree. Two or three (rarely four) aments cluster on lateral spur shoots and disintegrate when mature. Fruits are winged nutlets 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long by 0.8 mm (0.03 in) wide with styles 0.8 mm (0.03 in) long. The shape of bracts of the pistillate catkins is characteristic for the species, and variations are useful in distinguishing varieties. The seeds ripen from early August until mid-September. Seed dispersal begins soon after ripening and occurs earlier in injured trees than in healthy trees (46). Some seeds fall as early as July as a result of birds feeding on the developing catkins. Seed Production and Dissemination- Under normal conditions, paper birch begins producing seeds at about 15 years of age, and optimum seedbearing age is 40 to 70 years. However, seedlings grown in pots for one extended growing season in a greenhouse produced viable seeds (66 percent germination capacity) during the second season of growth under natural conditions out-of-doors (79). In mature stands, good seed crops occur every other year on the average, but some seeds are produced in most areas every year. Seed years vary with locality, so information specific to the area of interest is required for planning regeneration treatments. Some information can be gained by observing male catkins the fall before a seed year. An abundance of male catkins may mean a potentially good seed year, because both biotic and abiotic factors can destroy a potentially good crop. Lack of male catkins means a poor seed year. In average seed years, nearly 2.5 million seeds per hectare (1 million/acre) are produced and bumper years have 86 million or more seeds per hectare (35 million/acre). In a mature stand in Alaska, total dry weight of catkins was 6.8 kg (15 lb) per tree, yielding almost 9 million seeds (106). Discolored and empty seeds make up 14 to 47 percent of the crop, the lowest proportion of empty and discolored seeds occurs in the best seed years (4,7,8,63,108). Some paper birch seeds may be collected from August through the following spring, but most are dispersed during the months of September through November in both the eastern and western portions of the range (4,107). In Alaska, some seeds were caught in seed traps every month. The rate was less than 10 million/ha (4 million/acre) for December through August whereas it averaged 70 to 90 million/ha (28 to 36 million/acre) for September through November (106). Time of dispersal does not depend on size of seed crop (7) but varies among stands and from year to year depending upon weather conditions. Seeds that fall in late fall and winter have higher germination capacity than those that fall early (4). Extremely heavy seed crops can result in crown deterioration and reduced growth. In an Ontario stand, foliage was dwarfed or missing; buds in terminal portions of branches did not develop; and terminal growth and diameter growth were reduced when an extremely heavy seed crop was produced (41). The light, winged paper birch seeds (3 million/kg or 1.4 million/lb) are dispersed readily by the wind, and some seeds travel great distances, particularly when blown across the surface of snow. However, the majority of seeds fall within the stand where they are produced, and seedfall drops off rapidly with distance from the stand edge into clearcut openings. When seedfall within an undisturbed stand was compared with seed fall in a clearcut, seed catch was reduced by 40 percent at the stand edge and 90 percent at the center of the 100-m (330-ft) square opening. On the basis of these observations, it was estimated that a seed crop of 5 million/ha (2 million/acre) would be required to regenerate openings as large as 50 m (165 ft) wide (4). Similar results were obtained in Alaska where 30 to 40 million seeds per hectare (12 to 16 million/acre) were estimated at 40 m (132 ft) from the stand edge, and 0.5 to 0.7 million/ha (0.2 to 0.3 million/acre) were estimated at 100 m (330 ft) (106). Seed crops in interior Alaska are adequate for regeneration of clearcuts as wide as 30 m (100 ft) at least 1 in every 4 years (108). Under test conditions, paper birch seeds need no pretreatment for germination if tested under light at 20° to 25° C (68° to 77° F) (8,26,104). Seeds germinate in the dark if given either a prechilling or red light treatment; the red light effect can be reversed by far-red light, indicating that germination readiness is phytochrome mediated (2). Germination at low temperatures 5° to 10° C (41° to 50° F) under light is also enhanced by prechilling (26). In the field, germination generally follows one of two patterns: either germination starts as soon as environmental conditions are suitable and continues until all viable seed have germinated (19); or an initial burst of germination is followed by a period of low germination as seedbeds dry out, and when rainfall replenishes soil moisture, a second peak of germination occurs later in the summer (110). The proportion of sound, viable seed varies greatly among seed lots of paper birch. This proportion of viable seed can vary among seed years, localities, and specific mother trees (2). Some individuals may produce heavy seed crops frequently with consistently low (10 percent or less) germination (106). The percentage of viable seed can be estimated by examining embryo development with transmitted light under a dissecting microscope (8). Paper birch seed may be stored for at least 2 years at room temperature if the moisture content is maintained at less than 5 percent (8). Longer storage, up to 8 years, with only slight loss of germination capacity is possible when seeds are stored at 2° to 4° C (35° to 40° F) in sealed containers and at low moisture (17,79). After long storage, viability of each seed lot should be verified by a germination test before the seeds are used, because some seed lots do lose viability (17). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (8). Because of the small size of paper birch seed, newly germinated seedlings are very fragile. They are sensitive to moisture, temperature, light, and seedbed condition (46). Best germination occurs on mineral soil; germination on humus is reduced by about 50 percent, and germination on undisturbed litter is only 10 percent of that obtained on mineral soil. Shaded sites produce about twice as many germinants as full-sun sites. In a partially wind-thrown conifer forest, paper birch seedlings colonized windthrow pit and mound microsites, but most established seedlings were on rotting logs, stumps, and tree boles (100). Early survival of seedlings follows similar patterns, but initial height growth is better on humus than on undisturbed sites, probably because of greater nutrient availability. At the end of the first growing season, birch seedlings growing in full sunlight on mineral soil averaged 5 cm (2.0 in) tall compared with 12 cm (4.7 in) for those on humus. Maximum heights on the same seedbeds were 42 cm (16.5 in) for seedlings on humus and 20 cm (7.9 in) for those on mineral soil. Heights of seedlings in shaded locations on those same seedbeds were about one-half the maximum values (61,62). However, paper birch may grow well in about 50 percent of full sunlight. In a study of response to shading, paper birch seedlings grew taller under 45 percent sunlight than when grown in 100, 25, or 13 percent of sunlight. Total dry weight was equal for seedlings grown under 45 percent and 100 percent full sunlight (59). In Alaska, 3 years following clearcutting, scarified sites were 100 percent stocked, with an average of 1.7 million birch seedlings per hectare (0.7 million/acre). Unscarified seedbeds were only 30 percent stocked with an average of 50,000 seedlings per hectare (20,000/acre) (109). Paper birch seedlings averaged 28 cm (11 in) in height on the scarified plots and 5 cm (2 in) on the unscarified plots after 2 years (112). This difference in results from those in the Northeast is probably caused by severe competition from herbaceous and other vegetation that became established on the unscarified plots. On an upland black spruce site subjected to burning treatments, best germination, survival, and 3-year growth occurred on heavily burned microsites (111). After 5 years, in a Maine site-preparation study, there were more paper birch seedlings on disked sites than on burned or logged-only sites. But, after 10 years, the total number of birch seedlings, as well as the number of potential crop trees, was greater on the burned treatment than on either the disked or logged-only treatments (3,5): Following clearcutting or other disturbances, the bulk of paper birch regeneration becomes established during the first growing season from seeds that fell the previous fall and winter. Data for Alaska indicate that 88 percent of seedlings present at age 5 germinated during the first growing season following clearcutting and scarification, 8 percent during year 2, and 4 percent during year 3. About 20 percent of the first-year germinants were still alive after 5 years; 7.4 million/ha (3 million/acre) the first year and 1.7 million/ha (0.7 million/acre) the fifth year (110). Some birch seed may lie dormant in the forest floor for a year or more, especially following heavy seed crops and dry years when conditions for germination are poor (31,34,38,112). This dormant seed may be an important source of germinants in poor seed years (74). Seedlings of the variety cordifolia are slower growing than typical paper birch. When planted together under similar conditions in Quebec, typical paper birch grew to a height of 3.0 m (9.8 ft) in 5 years against 1.2 m (3.9 ft) for variety cordifolia (13,39). In the Northeast, clearcutting stands younger than 100 years to regenerate paper birch often results in severe competition from large numbers of seedlings of Rubus spp. and pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica), so that weeding or cleaning is needed to ensure satisfactory birch stocking (61). Large numbers of seeds of these species are stored in the forest floor in stands younger than 100 to 120 years old (36). Longer rotations are recommended to diminish the population of stored seeds and the consequent competition following disturbance. Even though natural regeneration of paper birch is obtained readily, planting of seedlings may sometimes be desired (45). In planting old fields, site preparation to remove sod is required for satisfactory survival and growth. Protection from girdling by rodents and browsing by deer may be required in some locations (6). Planting stock can be either conventional bare-root stock or container-grown seedlings (35). Seasonal height growth often begins while minimum temperatures are below freezing, rises gradually to a peak of maximum growth in mid-June, and then drops off gradually. Compared to other species, paper birch has a long period of height growth. Seedling height growth may be prolonged indefinitely under long-day conditions, whereas short days cause terminal growth to stop (27,40. Diameter growth starts after maximum temperatures reach 21° C (70° F) or more and minimum temperatures are above freezing. Temporary abrupt increases and decreases in diameter growth in the spring and fall are correlated with a sudden rise and fall of temperature but not with rainfall. Diameter growth ceases well before either moisture or temperature becomes limiting. In general, paper birch begins and ceases diameter growth later than most of its associates (46). Vegetative Reproduction- Paper birch can regenerate from sprouts following cutting or fire. Prolific sprouting usually occurs when young, vigorous trees have been cut in the spring to stump heights of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) (46). Whereas sprouts are seldom abundant enough to reproduce mature stands, they can be valuable supplements to seedlings, particularly on droughty or other difficult sites (63). In an early study of mature stands in Maine, 77 percent of the stumps sprouted, but only 27 percent had live sprouts after 2 years. Heavy browsing by deer was an important factor in sprout mortality (46). In Alaska, 85 to 99 percent of the paper birch stumps sprouted in stands as old as 55 years of age. Sprouting decreased to less than 50 percent in stands greater than 125 years old (106). Ten years after clearcutting and site preparation in a 70-year-old stand in Maine, sprouts were 34 percent of the potential crop trees on logged-only sites. Severe site preparation treatments of disking and burning reduced the number of sprouts as potential crop trees from 299/ha (121/acre) in the winter-logged treatment to 67/ha (27/acre) on burned plots and 32/ha (13/acre) on disked plots (5). Sprouting also may occur at the base of standing live trees that have been subjected to increased exposure by removal of nearby trees (46). Sprouts tend to mature earlier (age 50 to 60 years) and deteriorate sooner (age 70 to 90 years) than trees of seedling origin. Final quality is usually lower for sprouts (63). Paper birch can be propagated by grafting, air-layering (18), rooting of cuttings, or tissue-culture techniques. Cuttings from seedlings root sooner and at higher percentages than cuttings from mature trees. Eighty percent of stem and branch cuttings from 8- to 10-week-old paper birch seedlings rooted within 45 days when placed in 10 percent Hoagland's solution (no. 2) under a 16-hour photoperiod (44). Apical cuttings collected in July from 18-year-old paper birch and treated with indolebutyric acid (IBA) rooted better than cuttings collected on earlier or later dates with or without IBA treatment. Some individual trees consistently rooted better (over 40 percent), others consistently poorer (less than 20 percent), regardless of date of collection or hormone treatment of the cuttings (73). Stem segments and axillary buds from new germinants or 1- to 2-year-old seedlings proliferate into callus and multiple plantlets on a medium containing zeatin and adenine sulphate. These plantlets can be successfully transplanted to pots in a greenhouse and subsequently into the field (65). High rooting percentages in mature birch can be restored by establishing young plants through tissue culture techniques for a source of cuttings (92). Growth and Yield- Young paper birch grows rapidly. Individual trees often have a diameter of 20 cm (8 in) after 30 years. With age, the growth rate declines, and in old age it becomes almost negligible (46). Trees in mature stands average 25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 in) in d.b.h. and 21 m (70 ft) in height. On the best sites, an occasional tree in old stands may exceed 76 cm (30 in) in d.b.h. and 30 m (100 ft) in height. Trees of the variety cordifolia are as large as 102 cm (40 in) in d.b.h. (46,99). Yields at maturity on good sites are similar for Alaska, Ontario, or New England at 230 to 270 m³/ha (3,286 to 3,857 ft³/acre) (table 1). On poor sites, yields range from about 100 to 185 m³/ha (1,429 to 2,643 ft³/acre). New England stands produce the greatest Yields for all age classes and site qualities. Yields in Ontario are greater than those in Alaska for the first few decades, but growth rate of Ontario stands near maturity declines more rapidly than that of Alaskan stands. Thus, by age 80, Alaskan yields surpass those from Ontario on all sites (table 1) (40,63,72). The range of site index is similar for New England, New York, and the Lake States, 12 to 24 m (40 to 80 ft) at base age 50 years (22,23); and somewhat lower for Alaska, 11 to 20 m (35 to 65 ft) (40), indicating a lower growth potential, probably because permafrost and cold soils limit the growth of birch on many sites. Paper birch is considered a short-lived species. Trees mature in 60 to 70 years, and few live longer than 140 to 200 years (46). The variety cordifolia apparently has a longer life span. Several trees on Mt. Washington in New Hampshire were more than 200 years old; the oldest was 225 (37). Stands appear to last longer in Alaska than in more southerly regions (40). Mortality is heavy throughout the life of a paper birch stand. Individual trees express dominance early in life. Unless suppressed trees are released early, they soon die. Intermediate trees survive longer but gradually succumb after struggling for years at a low rate of growth (46). Initial stem diameter at the seedling and small sapling stage can be used to predict relative growth potential of trees selected for release. Trees that averaged only 0.8 cm (0.3 in) in diameter when released grew to 5.3 cm (2.1 in) in diameter after 24 years; trees in the same stand that were larger than 2.0 cm (0.8 in) in d.b.h. when released grew to 13.7 cm (5.4 in) in the same time (53). Rooting Habit- Paper birch is generally a shallow-rooted species. The bulk of the roots are found in the top 60 cm (24 in) of soil; taproots do not form. Rooting depth depends on soil depth and varies among forest stands and from tree to tree within stands (75). High wind will break the bole of paper birch more often than it will uproot the tree. Broken stems generally sprout (100). Rootlets with a primary xylem diameter greater than 25 percent of total diameter tend to become part of the permanent woody root system. Rootlets with a smaller diameter primary xylem are ephemeral (43,102). Reaction to Competition- Paper birch is classed as a shade-intolerant tree. Among its common associates in the Northeast, only aspen, pin cherry, and gray birch (Betula populifolia) are more intolerant. In the natural succession of species, paper birch usually lasts only one generation and then is replaced by more tolerant species (46). When growing in mixture with spruce or spruce-fir, birch often retains a position in the stand, and the stands do not go toward pure spruce climax (22,67,76). Birch persists in some Alaskan spruce stands because of a physical smothering of spruce seedlings by birch foliage, or in other instances, chemical properties of the ashes of birch following fires may inhibit spruce development (67). In declining old-growth stands of white spruce (Picea glauca) growing on flood plains in Alaska, paper birch invades openings created by death and uprooting of the spruce. Mineral soil exposed by the uprooting, and the rotting wood of the fallen trees, provide suitable seedbeds (28,52,106). In a study of drought response, paper birch saplings had lower leaf conductance values and higher water potential than white oak (Quercus alba) growing under the same soil moisture conditions. The birch trees reached water stress conditions sooner than the oak. The birch trees responded to stress by losing leaves, whereas the white oak was not severely stressed by conditions of the study (30). In a greenhouse study, paper birch seedlings were less tolerant of flooding than river birch (B. nigra). Once flooding treatments ended, paper birch seedlings grew faster and were as large as unflooded controls at the end of the experiment. Flooded river birch seedlings formed adventitious roots; paper birch did not (68). Because of its intolerance, paper birch often requires release from faster growing species such as aspen or pin cherry that overtop it in the early stages of regeneration (53). Response depends on degree of release. Generally, the greater the release, the greater the growth response of paper birch. Thinnings in sapling and pole stands also yield increased diameter growth of paper birch crop trees in proportion to the degree of release (79). Stands approaching maturity-more than 60 years-seldom respond to thinning (33,46). Paper birch is a nutrient-sensitive species. Seedling, sapling, pole, and sawtimber-size trees have all responded to fertilizer treatments in recent studies (15,24,78,80,94,96). In a mixed stand, paper birch responded more than quaking aspen but less than bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) to additions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and lime (24,81). Response indicated increased stem wood and bark, branches, and foliage (84,85). Damaging Agents- In the eastern part of its range, large percentages of paper birch were killed or damaged by a condition called birch dieback during the late 1930's and 1940's. Symptoms include dying back of twigs and branches in the crown, loss of vigor, and eventual death over a period of 5 to 6 years. Trees most often damaged were shallow rooted and showed root mortality before crown symptoms. The root mortality was attributed to environmental conditions (75). Many trees sprouted epicormic branches in the lower crown and bole and eventually recovered. The dieback condition has subsided and currently is not considered an important threat to paper birch (46,63). Postlogging decadence-a condition resembling birch dieback-sometimes develops in residual trees following partial cutting. The older the stand and the heavier the cutting, the more likely this condition. For example, trees left as seed trees in regeneration cuttings are almost certain to decline and die within a few years. The best way to avoid these problems in managed stands of birch is to maintain vitality of trees through periodic thinnings begun at an early age. Also, heavy partial cuttings in mature previously untreated stands should be avoided (63). The bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius) is the most serious insect pest of the paper birch. Usually it attacks overmature trees or trees in weakened condition. The borer played a secondary role in the dieback outbreak and undoubtedly caused the death of some trees that otherwise might have recovered. To prevent buildup of this insect, weakened and mature trees should be removed from the stand, and injury to residual trees should be avoided (21). The most serious defoliators of birch are the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the birch skeletonizer (Bucculatrix canadensisella), the birch leafminer (Fenusa pusilla), birch leaf-mining sawflies (Heterarthrus nemoratus and Profenusa thomsoni), the birch casebearer (Coleophora serratella), as well as the general forest defoliators-the saddled prominent (Heterocampa guttivitta), and the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), and in Alaska, the spearmarked black moth (Rheumaptera hastata) (101). Defoliation alone seldom causes mortality of otherwise healthy trees. Rather, growth rate is reduced and trees become susceptible to other damaging agents, particularly the bronze birch borer, which attacks and causes death of substantial numbers of trees (21). Cambium miners, such as Phytobia pruinosa, and ambrosia beetles, such as Trypodendron betulae or Xyloterinus politus, make injuries that cause defects in paper birch timber but seldom cause the death of trees (63,88). The variety cordifolia may be less susceptible to severe insect attacks than the typical paper birches (39). Micro-organisms that enter the bole of the tree through wounds or branch stubs cause discoloration and decay in paper birch wood. A condition known as red heart is a very common defect in some areas. The wood is darkened in color but may be sound enough for some uses. Principal decay-causing fungi include Inonotus obliqua, Phellinus igniarius, and Pholiota spp. (63). Stem cankers that ruin the tree for timber purposes and make it unsightly are often caused by Inonotus obliqua and L glomeratus (87) and Nectria galligena. The root-rotting fungus Armillaria mellea infects birch trees, causing cracks at the base of the stem (""collar crack""). Attack by root-rotting fungi can also result in uprooting by the wind (88). Animals that damage paper birch stands include white-tailed deer, porcupines, moose, and hares. The most serious threat from deer and moose is over-browsing at the seedling stage, which reduces the amount of dominant birch in regenerating stands or impairs the quality of survivors (46,51). Porcupines damage larger trees by feeding on the inner bark and girdling large branches in the cr6wn and upper trunk. The yellow-bellied sapsucker pecks rows of holes through the bark; these are the source of entry for discoloration and decay organisms and may cause ring shake (88). If a dense band of holes girdles the stem, all or a major portion of the crown will die, leading to a weakened state that can invite attack by the bronze birch borer or decay organisms. In a Maine study, 51 percent of the paper birch trees damaged by sapsuckers died. Damage by hares and other small mammals is of critical importance to the development of planted seedlings (6). Hares clip or gnaw bark on small birch seedlings causing reduction in birch stocking (51). Red squirrels may girdle stems by stripping off the bark (46) or wound the tree by biting it to obtain sap (88). Fire, which is responsible for the establishment of many paper birch stands, is also one of the most serious enemies of established stands. Because the bark of paper birch is thin and highly flammable, even large trees may be killed by moderate fires (46). However, in Alaska, pure birch stands have little fuel available, so fires are not common. Hot crown fires in spruce become slow-burning ground fires when they enter birch stands; the fire may even go out. In extreme drying of deep organic horizons in some birch stands, a hot, slow-moving fire will consume all of the organic matter, leaving the shallow-rooted birch without support. The otherwise undamaged trees soon fall over (106). Paper birch is very susceptible to logging damage during partial harvest treatments using mechanical techniques. Up to 53 percent of designated crop trees sustained injuries to root systems, boles, or both during a careful thinning (69). Near Sudbury, Ontario, air pollution with heavy metals from mining and smelting operations has created a coppice woodland dominated by paper birch and red maple. Seedlings are repeatedly killed back and sprout from the base, creating multi-stemmed stools. On an exposed ridge, 18-year-old paper birch sprouts averaged 3.3 in (10.8 ft) in height and 5.8 cm (2.3 in) d.b.h. On a more protected site, 21-year-old paper birch sprouts averaged 5.9 in (19.4 ft) in height and 7.8 cm (3.7 in) d.b.h. (48). In the greenhouse study previously mentioned, fumigation with S02 caused partial stomatal closure, visible foliar injury, and reduced growth rate of both river and paper birch. Stomatal conductance and S02 uptake of flooded seedlings were lower than controls, but S02 effects were the same whether flooded or not (68). People vandalize trees along roadsides and in parks and picnic areas by peeling off strips of the outer papery bark. The trees are seldom killed but always carry unsightly scars. In areas of great scenic value, the exposed inner bark can be painted white to disguise the wound.",Life History,Paper Birch,betula,papyrifera,hardwood,10,0
"Young regenerating stands of paper birch and associated species provide prime browse and cover for deer and moose (86,91). Although pin cherry is preferred over birch as a browse species, birch is more important because it is more abundant (70). In Alaska, birch stands produce less browse than aspen but more than willow and alder. Willows are a preferred browse species by Alaskan moose, but birch is preferred to aspen, balsam poplar, or alder. It takes 3 to 5 years following logging, a fire, or other disturbance for production of young trees to begin providing sufficient buds and twigs for browsing animals. Peak browse production occurs from 10 to 16 years after the disturbance. Mature stands have essentially no available browse (103). The browse index for yellow and paper birch in the four northeastern National Forests indicates that birch is preferred 2.5 to almost 5 times more than its abundance would suggest (86). Paper birch is also an important source of food for birds. The redpoll, pine siskin, and chickadee feed on seeds; the ruffed grouse eats male catkins and buds (86). The graceful form and attractive white bark of paper birch make it a prized species for ornamental planting and landscaping around homes and public buildings. The main drawback is that bark on young paper birch remains golden or brown in color until about age 10 to 12. For that reason, European birches and some other introduced species that have white bark at earlier ages are more frequently chosen as ornamentals. Its status as a pioneer species and its adaptability to disturbed sites indicates that paper birch is a prime hardwood species for use in revegetating spoils and other drastically disturbed sites. Paper birch has been planted successfully on acid coal mine spoils. Survival of 2-0 planting stock ranged from 58 to 98 percent on spoils with a pH ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 (25). Paper birch can be tapped in the spring to obtain sap from which syrup, wine, beer, or medicinal tonics can be made. The carbohydrate content of about 0.9 percent consists of glucose, fructose, and sucrose. This contrasts with the 2 to 3 percent sugar found in the sap of sugar maple. Currently only a few small-scale sugaring operations are in Alaska (32). Sap flow season for birch begins and ends later than for maples. Birch syrup contains lower sugar concentrations than maple (302 and 711 g/l) and is more acidic (pH 5.2 and 6.6) (50). Paper birch has moderately dense wood. Full tree chips can be used in pulp and paper manufacture, other reconstituted uses, and fuel. Branches contain fewer fibers and more vessels than bole-wood. Branch fibers and vessels are 30 to 50 percent shorter and smaller in diameter than those from boles. Pulp from branch-wood is weaker in mechanical strength than pulp from bole-wood but is suitable for paper making (54,55). Equations for estimating biomass of full trees and various components from tree diameter, height, or both, are available (49,83,89,105). As a fuel, caloric values for paper birch did not differ significantly between samples with and without bark, or between bole and branch components when data for samples with and without bark were pooled (66). Paper birch bark has a high fuel value. Of 24 species tested, it had the highest caloric value per unit weight-5740 cal/g (10,331 Btu/lb)-and the third highest per unit volume3209 cal/cm³ (360,569 Btu/ft³) (42).",Special Uses,Paper Birch,betula,papyrifera,hardwood,16,0

"Studies of variation in natural pecan stands throughout Louisiana indicateda large genetic diversity within populations. Also, there was a high degree ofvariation between breeding populations, indicating a close relationship(inbreeding) among trees in small stands. Genotype x environment interactionwas highly significant between progeny tests of open pollinated selected trees.Heritability estimates for height growth indicated ample genetic variation toanticipate significant gains in breeding programs (1,28,29). More than a hundred horticultural clones have been listed (37). These wereselected primarily for various characteristics concerning commercial nutproduction. More recently several cultivars have been developed for the samepurpose. Complex hybridized natural populations are common. Natural interspecifichybridization occurs with Carya aquatica (C. x lecontei Little),C. cordiformis (C. x brownii Sarg.), C. laciniosa (C. xnussbaumeri Sarg.), C. ovata, and C. tomentosa (C. xschneckii Sarg.)

"Pecan grows principally in the lower Mississippi Valley. Within this regionit extends westward to eastern Kansas and central Texas, eastward to westernMississippi and western Tennessee. Sparse occurrence has been reported alongthe eastern margin of its range from southwestern Ohio to Kentucky and Alabama.Pecan also grows locally throughout northeastern and central Mexico (34). -The native range of pecan. Pecan grows in a humid climate; the minimum average annual rainfallapproximates 760 mm (30 in) and the maximum reaches 2010 mm (79 in). At least510 mm (20 in) of rain falls during the growing season. Annual snowfall variesfrom 0 to 50 cm (0 to 20 in). Mean summer temperatures range as high as27° C (81° F), with extremes of 41° to 46° C (105° to115° F). Average winter temperatures vary from 10° to -1° C(50° to 30° F), with extremes of -18° to -29° C (0° to-20° F) (2,26,27). Sweet pecan grows commonly on well-drained loam soils which are not subjectto prolonged flooding. However, it does appear on heavy textured soils, whereit is limited to alluvial soils of recent origin. On such land forms its bestdevelopment is on the ridges and well-drained flats. It rarely grows on low andpoorly drained clay flats where it is replaced by water hickory (Caryaaquatica) (2,21). These soils are most commonly found in the ordersEntisols, Inceptisols, and Alfisols. Pecan seedlings can survive short periodsof flooding (18).",Habitat,Pecan,carya,illinoesis,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowering of pecan takes place from Aprilthrough May. The species is monoecious; flowers are borne in staminate andpistillate catkins on the same tree. Staminate flowers appear in slenderfascicled, sessile catkins, 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) long. The calix is two- orthree-lobed, with a center lobe that is longer than the lateral ones, and fiveor six stamens. Pistillate catkins are hairy, yellow, and not as numerous asstaminate ones, with two to four stigmas (37). Most pecan cultivars are clonesderived from wild trees. These cultivars generally show incomplete dichogamy.In some cultivars there is no overlap at all in the period of pollen dehiscenceand stigma receptivity, thus requiring more than one cultivar for successfulpollination and fruit set (20). Pecan is anemophilous, and excessive rainfallduring the flowering period may prevent pollination. Beginning in late summer, buds of pecan develop a physiological state ofrest, characterized by loss of apical dominance and cessation of both terminaland lateral growth. Existence of a cold requirement was first indicated byWaite (38). Intensity and dissipation of rest depend on the temperature regimesand genetic factors (4). Seed Production and Dissemination- Fruits ripen in September andOctober and are dispersed from September through December (8). Pecan fruits areovoid, globose or pear-shaped nuts, enclosed in husks developed from the floralinvolucre. The green husks turn brown to black as they ripen. The husks becomedry at maturity and split away from the nut in four valves along suturesstarting from the base The minimum seed-bearing age is 2 to 4 years in somecultivars and up to 20 years for individuals in natural stands. The maximumseed-bearing age also varies considerably; a maximum of 300 years has beenreported (37). The cleaned nuts average about 220 to 350/kg (100 to 160/lb).Good crops are produced at intervals from 1 to 3 years. Seed dispersal isprincipally by water and animals. The floating nuts can be carried considerabledistances by flood water. Aerial dispersion is mainly by squirrels (21). Seedling Development- Seeds can be stored for 3 to 5 years inclosed containers at 5° C (41° F) an 90 percent relative humidity(8). Seed stratification and germination conditions have been reported bvarious authors (3,6,12,36). As with all hickories, germination is hypogeal.Seeds of pecan show delayed germination, since the shell mechanically restrictsradicle elongation. To overcome this delay the nuts are stratified at 2°to 5° C (36° to 41° F) for 30 to 90 days, followed by incubationat room temperature. However, the restriction can be nullified by incubatingthe nuts at 30° to 35° C (86° to 95° F), without priorstratification. Under this regime, uniform and rapid germination occurs and iscompleted in 20 days. Germination without prior stratification is greatlyenhanced by soaking the nuts in gibberellic acid (7). Under natural conditions, pecan nuts remain dormant until spring whengermination starts in early April and extends to early June. Exceptionally dryweather or heavy aerial competition greatly reduces survival. On loamy soilsheight growth averages about 90 cm (35 in) per year for several years underfavorable weather conditions (21). Vegetative Reproduction- Rooting experiments with shoot cuttings gavehighly variable success rates. The principal variables were time of collection,thickness and origin of cuttings, chemical treatments, and genetic factors.Softwood cuttings are easier to root than hardwood or semi-hardwood cuttings.The time of shoot collection, however, seems most important. Juvenile cuttings,taken about midway of the dormant season and dipped in 10,000 p/m indolebutyricacid, gave 100 percent rooting; adult wood rooted 85 percent under theseconditions (31). Shoots derived from adventitious buds root better than othershoots, especially when terminal buds are removed (14). The optimum collectionperiod for pecan cuttings appears to be during mid-rest or after 200 to 400hours of field chilling below 72° C (45° F) have accumulated.Cuttings collected after 500 hours chilling force buds rather than roots (19).Softwood cuttings may root in 15 days and flush after 35 days (30).Air-layering is also successful in pecans; the timing of this treatment is veryessential (25). Pecan can also be regenerated from the stump. If the strongestshoot is trained as the new tree, while the others are removed, vigorous growthwill result (40). Commercial cultivars may be propagated by grafting onimproved root stocks. Growth and Yield- On loamy soils, height growth may average 90 cm (35in) per year for several years (21). Diameter growth of pecan parallels theaverage for bottom lands. The average 10-year diameter growth in naturalunmanaged stands in the northeast Louisiana delta is 5 cm (2.0 in) in the 15 to30 cm (6 to 12 in) diameter class, 7 cm (2.7 in) in the 35 to 45 cm (14 to 18in) diameter class, 5 cm (2 in) in the 50 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) diameterclass, and 6 cm (2.3 in) in the 75 cm (30 in) diameter class (5). Mature pecan is a medium to very large straight-stemmed tree reaching up to55 in (180 ft) in height and occasionally 180 to 210 cm (70 to 83 in) in d.b.h.(21) (fig. 2). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Pecan is classed as intolerant of shade butmore tolerant than cottonwood and willow. It is a subclimax species. Pecanresponds well to release in all age groups, provided that the trees have goodvigor (21). Damaging Agents- Only the most common fungal diseases are listedhere. A spot anthracnose, Elsinoe randii, causes an important nurseryblight. Small reddish lesions form on both leaf surfaces. Tissue falls out ofthe spots, producing holes and ragged leaf margins (39). Cladosporiumeffusum (pecan scab) is a limiting factor in nut production in parts of theSouth. Lesions along the veins and underside of the leaves are produced (15).Gnomonia nerviseda (vein spot), G. caryae, and G. caryaevar. pecanae (liver spot) are common (34). Microstroma juglandiscauses leafspot or white mold as well as witches' brooms. Cercosporahalstedii, the conidial stage of Mycosphaerella dendroides (9),causes leaf blotch. Mycosphaerella caryigena, known as downy spot,causes frosty spots on the lower leaf surfaces (23). A large number of fungi rot the woody cylinder of living hickories. Some rotheartwood; others rot senescent or dead sapwood. Prominent genera are Fomes,Poria, and Polyporus (15). Poria spiculosa is a most damaging andcommon canker that produces thick, deep callus folds. It appears as roughcircular swellings on the bole (33). Phomopsis tumor is a widespreadgall-forming fungus. It produces from warty growths on twigs to large burls ontrunks (34). Among the common root rot diseases are Clitocybe tabescens,Phymatotrichum omnivorum (Texas root rot), and Helicobasidium purpureum(violet root rot). Feeder root necrosis is produced by Fusarium solani,F oxysporum, and Pythium irregulare. Other diseases include Criconemoides quadricornis, a ""ring""nematode (16), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, an economically importantbacterial disease in pecan. In the South pecan is affected by a viral broomingdisorder that results in a dense growth of willowy shoots (22). Pecan rosetteis a common bunching disease in the South caused by zinc deficiency (10). Many insects feed on pecan leaves, nuts, twigs, wood, and roots (11,24).Among the beetles are Goes pulcher, the living hickory borer, whoselarvae feed on trunks and branches; they are common throughout the UnitedStates. Oncideres cingulata, twig girdler, and 0. pustulatus,hinsache girdler, are wood borers that at times become numerous. Adultfemales girdle branches, which then die and fall off. Occasionally youngseedlings may be cut off near the ground. The hickory bark beetle (Scolytusquadrispinosus) bores into boles and branches and can do considerabledamage. Severe outbreaks causing extensive tree mortality occur whenprecipitation is insufficient in summer. The flat oak borer (Smodicumcucujiforme) attacks heartwood of trees as well as cut lumber. This beetleoccurs throughout the Eastern United States. The so-called pinhole borers(Xyleborus affinis, X. ferrugineus, and Xyleborinus saxesensi)inhabit trunks and stems of many hardwoods, including pecan, in theSoutheastern United States. They primarily attack trees weakened by drought,mechanical damage, or cold injury. Occasionally they attack healthy trees butrarely cause serious damage since the larvae cannot subsist on wood with goodsap flow. The hickory shoot curculio (Conotrachelus aratus) feeds onunfolding buds and young shoots of pecan and may cause extensive damage. Thenut curculio (Conotrachelus hicoriae) attacks immature pecan nuts. Bothbeetle species occur in the Pecan Belt. The flatfooted ambrosia beetle(Platypus compositus) causes injuries in freshly felled trees due toextensive burrowing. This beetle occurs throughout the Southern United States.The tilehorned root borer (Prionus imbricornis) and the broadnecked rootborer (Prionus laticollis) are beetles whose larvae feed on root bark ofliving trees. They soon enter the roots, completely hollowing and occasionallysevering them. Other injurious insects include the following: the sycamore lacebug(Corythucha ciliata), which feeds on leaves of pecan, and is common inthe Eastern United States (13); the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosomadisstria) and the walnut caterpillar (Datana integerrima), whichdefoliate pecan trees; and the pecan carpenterworm (Cossula magnifica),found throughout the Eastern United States, whose larvae attack smalltwigs, bore into the pith, and soon burrow into heartwood. The pecan weevil(Curculio caryae) at times destroys most of the nut crop in the southernpart of the pecan range. Heavy attacks by the obscure scale (Chrysomphalusobscurus) cause small limbs to die. Pecan is susceptible to fire damage at all ages. Fire in the bottom landsmoves rapidly along the soil surface, killing most tree reproduction andoccasionally scorching the sensitive bark of older trees. Particularly hotfires may kill mature pecan trees.",Life History,Pecan,carya,illinoesis,hardwood,10,0
"Improved cultivars are extensively grown in the United States and abroad forcommercial nut production.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Pin cherry flowers from late March to early July. Flower buds are formed in August or September of the preceding year (17). In Warren County, PA, flowers appear from May 1 to May 15. The perfect flowers are white and 12 to 16 min (0.47 to 0.63 in) broad with long pedicels; they are borne in corymbs or umbels and expand with the leaves. The globose fruits ripen from July to September, depending on locality. They are light red, 5 to 7 min (0.20 to 0.28 in) in diameter, and have thin, acid flesh and subglobose stones 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in) long (9,10,16). Fruiting occurs as early as age 2 in natural stands in Pennsylvania (16). Sexual maturity of natural dominant trees in New Hampshire may be attained during the fourth growing season though large quantities of fruits are not produced until several years later (23). Seed Production and Dissemination- Fruits are dispersed by gravity and to a much lesser degree by birds and small mammals after the fruits ripen in July (12). The weight of cleaned seeds per 45 kg (100 lb) of fruit ranges from 7 to 12 kg (16 to 27 lb). The number of cleaned seeds per kilogram ranges from 17,600 (8,000/lb) to 48,100 (21,800/lb) and averages about 31,300/kg (14,200/lb) (16). In a 4-year study on the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia, trees with an average d.b.h. of 12 cm (4.7 in) yielded 0.64 liter (0.68 qt) of fruit per tree (26). Half the trees bore fruit, and fruit yields varied substantially from year to year. Fruits were produced at 3- to 4-year intervals. In New Hampshire, dominant trees produced some fruit at 4 years, but quantity production occurred later. Despite its short life span of about 30 years, fruit production in pin cherry is high. For 15-year-old, open-grown trees in pure stands, annual fruit production was estimated at 2,762,500 fruits per hectare (1,118,000/acre). For 25-year-old pin cherry stands in the same area of New Hampshire, annual seed production was 2,324,500/ha (940,700/acre) (23). Many seeds remain buried in the soil in areas where pin cherry once grew. Some seeds are disseminated by birds that excrete or regurgitate the seeds at a distance from their source, and some are moved by mammals (1,23). In two areas in New Hampshire, the average number of viable pin cherry seeds in the forest floor ranged from 345,000/ha (139,676/acre) to 494,000/ha (200,000/acre) (23). In other New Hampshire stands, depending on stand age, the number of viable seeds in the forest floor ranged from 10,000 to 1,110,500/ha (4,050 to 450,000/acre) (15). It has been estimated that some seeds buried in the soil retain their viability for 50 to 150 years (15,22). Seedling Development- Pin cherry germination is epigeal and most pin cherry reproduction arises from seed stored in the forest floor. In natural stands in northwestern Pennsylvania, Marquis (24) reported 36,800/ha (14,900/acre), 14,100/ha (5,700/acre), and 46,700/ha (18,900/acre) pin cherry seedlings germinating after removal of one-half, two-thirds, and all of the overstory, respectively. In New England, more pin cherry seedlings germinated from soil blocks taken from 38- and 95-yearold stands than from 5- or 200-year-old stands (15). More than 70 percent germinated during the first summer in the 38- and 95-year-old stand samples. The number of germinating seeds was 2, 111, 52, and 1 per m² (from fewer than 1 to 10/ft²) for the 5-, 38-, 95-, and 200-year-old stands, respectively. In the central Appalachians in West Virginia, dense thickets of pin cherry frequently develop after clearcutting 40- to 70-year-old hardwood stands. On two areas 5 years after clearcutting, there were between 2,470 and 7,410 pin cherry seedlings/ha (1,000 and 3,000/acre) 0.3 m (1.0 ft) high and up to 2.5 cm (1.0 in) in d.b.h. and between 680 and 990 stems/ha (275 to 400/acre) 2.5 to 12.7 cm (1.0 to 5.0 in) d.b.h. (25). A small amount of pin cherry seed probably germinates annually in northern hardwood stands. However, seedlings have been reported to survive only in large openings where light and moisture were more available. The largest number of pin cherry seedlings appeared in response to major disturbances such as heavy cutting or burning (23). In one study, mechanical removal of the endocarp and a cool temperature, 15° C (59° F), promoted better pin cherry germination. The germination rate of pin cherry was greatly improved by soaking seed for 24 hours in a chemical solution (0.5 M hydroxylammonium chloride) followed by a series of drastic temperature fluctuation treatments (20). With this treatment the seed germination rate was more than 75 percent. Often pin cherry seed germination is less than 10 percent when seed viability is 100 percent. It appears that the factor triggering increased germination of buried pin cherry seed following forest disturbance is the more extreme temperature fluctuation created by removing the overstory (20). Although the factors accounting for the natural germination of pin cherry could not be determined exactly, apparently (a) time is needed to age the endocarp so it becomes more permeable to water and oxygen, and (b) changes in soil and water chemistry in response to the altered microclimate of a disturbed site or to other conditions is necessary (22). In northeastern Pennsylvania, pin cherry germination generally increased with light under no moisture stress, but under normal moisture stress, germination was best under partial shade. Under heavy shade, pin cherry seedling mortality is high, but with increasing light, survival is increased. Growth of seedlings is rapid and directly related to the amount of light received (24). Repeated applications of N to existing sawtimber stands could reduce the pin cherry component in future stands. In situations where pin cherry outgrows other more desirable species after regeneration cuttings, N fertilization might benefit maturing stands by increasing growth rates of residual trees and reducing the numbers of pin cherry seeds that would germinate and later compete with preferred reproduction (2). Ripened fruits of pin cherry should be collected from trees or from the ground in late summer. For storage the pulp should be removed and the seeds stored in sealed containers at 1° to 3° C (34° to 38° F). Seed viability has been retained for up to 10 years under these conditions (12). For nursery sowing, pin cherry seed should be stratified in moist sand for 60 days at alternating temperatures of 20° to 30° C (68° to 86° F) and for 90 days between 3° to 5° C (37° to 41° F) (16). Vegetative Reproduction- Because pin cherry suckers readily, it should grow well from root cuttings. Sour cherry is often grafted on pin cherry root stocks, but budding is a more common practice (3,29).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pin Cherry,prunus,pensylvanica,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Information on the growth and yield of pin cherry is scarce. In thickets, it forms a closed canopy in 3 to 7 years and reaches maturity in 20 to 40 years (14). On dry, compact glacial till soils in New Hampshire, where pin cherry may comprise 50 percent of the species composition in sapling stands, mean annual biomass production was 3290 kg/ha (2,931 lb/acre), mean annual basal area growth was 1.30 m²/ha (5.66 ft²/acre), mean annual d.b.h growth was 2 mm (0.08 in), and mean annual height growth was 0.23 m (0.75 ft) (21). When young stands of northern hardwoods are cut, nearly pure stands of pin cherry often become established. When the pin cherry dies, the succession is to sugar maple and beech. When older stands are cut and the initial density of pin cherry is lower, the succession is towards quaking aspen and bigtooth aspen, yellow birch and paper birch. On lower elevations in New England and south through the Appalachians, the succession is to the White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple, White Pine, Red Spruce, or Red Spruce-Fraser Fir types, or to the northern hardwood types (14). Pin cherry growth is rapid, and it is not uncommon for trees growing on better sites in the central Appalachians to reach 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) in diameter in 25 years (25). Pin cherry rarely persists in eastern upland hardwood forests in the United States for more than 35 years (2). Annual biomass production, including belowground material, in 6-year-old stands of pin cherry was about 1660 g/m² (0.34 lb/ft²), which is higher than production in other temperate climate forests (22). Rooting Habit- Once a seedling attains a height of about 1 m (3 ft), lateral roots begin rapid growth (17). In New England, root systems in 4- to 14-yearold stands were found to be shallow, generally not over 36 cm (14 in) deep, and to have many lateral branches (23). In West Virginia, root systems of wind-thrown trees 25 years old were found to be confined to the upper 61 cm. (24 in) of soil (25). New shoots can arise from pieces of root left in the soil following site disturbance. Root cuttings, about 10 cm (4 in) in length, rooted 33 percent when incubated in soil under favorable greenhouse conditions (17). Reaction to Competition- Pin cherry is classed as very intolerant of shade. Early height growth is rapid, and where there is a high concentration of buried seed to produce seedlings after cutting or burning, pin cherry usually is dominant over all other vegetation. In dense stands, the canopy closes in about 3 years, shading out many of the early intolerant species. After 25 to 30 years, sugar maple, beech, and in the northernmost regions, balsam fir are the seral species. At intermediate densities, pin cherry may be codominant with yellow birch, paper birch, and quaking aspen. At low densities, dominance is shared by many species including blackberries, striped maple paper and yellow birch, quaking aspen, and stump sprouts of cut trees (23). Damaging Agents- Many diseases attack pin cherry during its short life. The most common leaf disease is cherry leaf spot, Coccomyces hiemalis, which is recognized by purplish to brown shot holes in the leaves that eventually cause yellowing of leaves and premature leaf fall. Repeated attacks reduce tree vigor. Other leaf spots on pin cherry are caused by Cercospora circumscissa, Coryneum carpophyllum, and three species of Phyllosticta. Additional pin cherry diseases are powdery mildew, Podosphaera oxyacanthae var. tridactyla; rust, Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae; and leaf curler, Taphrina cerasi. The most widespread and commonly observed disease of pin cherry is black knot, Apiosporina morbosa (31). Extensive trunk rot in the East is caused by Fomes pomaceus. This decay delignifies the wood, which then becomes soft, stringy, and discolored with brown flecks and streaks (18). Most of the important insects that attack pin cherry are leaf feeders, but because of the low economic value of pin cherry, they are considered unimportant. A major leaf feeder is the uglynest caterpillar, Archips cerasivoranus (Fitch) and occasionally the eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum (17,30). Other leaf feeders are the cherry leaf beetle, Pyrrhalta cavicollis, a relative of the elm leaf beetle; Bruce spanworm, Operophtera bruceata; fall canker worm, Alsophila pometaria; and a web-spinning sawfly, Neurotoma fasciata (4). Many other insects attack Prunus, but there are only a few references to their attacks on pin cherry.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pin Cherry,prunus,pensylvanica,hardwood,14,0
"Pin cherry grows on infertile rocky ledges, sandy plains, moist loamy soils, and rich loams (14). Throughout the Appalachian Mountains, the soils fall into the general order of Inceptisols. In New England and eastern Canada, Spodosols predominate. Around the Great Lakes, Alfisols are the major order with some Histosols and Spodosols. In the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada pin cherry grows on soils belonging to the general orders of Alfisols, Entisols, and Mollisols. On bituminous coal banks in central Pennsylvania, pin cherry and trembling aspen are the most abundant pioneer tree species and may account for 33 percent of the plant cover in 10 years (6). Pin cherry usually follows the distribution of Kellogg's great soil groups - Podzol, Gray-Brown Podzolic, and Lithosol (19). In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, pin cherry is a major component in rock and soil slide successions but is usually far more numerous after wind-throw, logging, or light fires because its presence depends on seed buried in the forest floor (11). In the aspen communities of the Lake States, pin cherry is abundant on the moist and clayey soils (7). Pin cherry, though mainly a northern species, regenerates naturally throughout most of its range after a heavy cutting or fire. In the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, it is most common at elevations above 915 m (3,000 ft). On the ""heath"" balds at higher elevations in the southern Appalachians, pin cherry may be a major component. In New England, pin cherry stands are underlain by a wide range of soils including unstratified glacial till derived from acidic and relatively infertile parent materials. The soils are shallow, well-drained Spodosols and range from very stony to extremely stony sandy loams to loams.",Soils and Topography,Pin Cherry,prunus,pensylvanica,hardwood,15,0
"Twenty-five species of nongame birds, several upland game birds, fur and game mammals, and small mammals eat pin cherry fruit. Buds are eaten by upland game birds, especially sharp-tailed and ruffed grouse. Foliage and twigs are browsed by deer. However, the foliage has a high calcium to phosphorous ratio which is undesirable for good deer nutrition. Except in dense thickets, pin cherry provides only fair nesting cover and materials for birds. Beavers cut pin cherry and may completely remove small stands (12). Leaves are poison (hydrocyanic acid) to livestock under certain conditions. However, the toxicity of pin cherry leaves is lower than that of most other cherry species (17). Because of its early place in succession and its rapid growth, pin cherry is important for minimizing losses of nutrients from an ecosystem. The rapid development of early successional species, such as pin cherry, channels water from runoff to evapotranspiration, thereby reducing erosion and nutrient loss; modifies the microclimate which reduces the rate of decomposition of litter and production of soluble ions; and incorporates into the developing biomass nutrients that do become available (22). In general, pin cherry is not used for lumber and is considered a noncommercial species. It occurs in abundance, however, over a wide range of sites and produces large quantities of biomass in a relatively short time. The species has been described as well adapted to intensive management and chip harvesting on short rotations for fiber and fuel (13). At least one paper company accepts pin cherry along with other hardwood species in West Virginia (8). Undoubtedly, it is also mixed with hardwoods in other areas. In the nursery trade, pin cherry has been used as a grafting and budding stock for sour cherry (12,29).",Special Uses,Pin Cherry,prunus,pensylvanica,hardwood,16,0
"Pin oak is a major species in only one forest cover type, Pin Oak-Sweetgum (Society of American Foresters Type 65), which is found on bottom lands and some upland sites throughout the central portion of the pin oak range (8). Associated species in this type include red maple (Acer rubrum), American elm (Ulmus americana), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), willow oak (Q. phellos), overcup oak (Q. lyrata), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Nuttall oak (Quercus nuttallii), swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii), and shellbark (Carya laciniosa) and shagbark (C. ovata) hickories. Pin oak and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) vary in their relative proportions in this cover type, and large areas of almost pure pin oak occur on the ""pin oak flats"" of the upland glacial till plains or in the bottom lands of the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys. Pin oak is an associated species in Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62) in the bottom lands along the Ohio, Wabash, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers; a variant of this type, silver maple-American elm-pin oak-sweetgum, is found along major streams in southern Illinois and Indiana. Pin oak also occurs in Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39) in poorly drained bottom lands in northern Ohio and Indiana along with silver maple (Acer saccharinum), swamp white oak, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black tupelo, and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides).",Associated Forest Cover,Pin Oak,quercus,palustris,hardwood,1,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Pin oak is monoecious; flowers appear at about the time the leaves develop in the spring. Staminate flowers are borne on aments that develop from buds formed in the leaf axils of the previous year, and pistillate flowers are borne on short stalks from the axils of current-year leaves. Pollination is by wind. Fruit is an acorn (nut) that matures at the end of the second growing season after flowering. Acorns are dispersed from September to early December (25). Seed Production and Dissemination- Pin oak stands begin producing seed at about age 20, but open-grown trees may begin at ages as young as 15 years (22,25). During a 14-year period, production of mature acorns in 32- to 46-year-old pin oak stands in southeastern Missouri averaged 210,300/ha (85,100/acre) but varied yearly from 13,300 to 492,700/ha (5,400 to 199,400/acre). Poor acorn crops occurred at 3- to 4-year intervals. Insect infestation rates varied inversely with crop size and, over all years, averaged 26 percent (19). Pin oak acorns are dispersed by squirrels, mice, blue jays, and woodpeckers. Pin oak acorns submerged in cold water as long as 6 months were not damaged. This tolerance may be partly due to a thick, waxy coating on the pericarp that impedes water absorption (5,23). The acorns require stratification of 30 to 45 days at 0° to 5° C (32° to 41° F) to break dormancy, and germination of sound, stratified acorns averages about 68 percent (30). Seedling Development- Germination is hypogeal (22). Pin oak seedlings established after good seed years are often abundant. In southeastern Missouri, an average of 8,650 new seedlings per hectare (3,500/acre) were present the summer following a good seed year. Seedling establishment rates were higher on areas that had been scarified the previous summer than on undisturbed areas. In an adjacent area that had been artificially flooded for 3 months during the winter, almost no new seedlings developed, partly because many of the acorns were consumed by thousands of migrating ducks attracted to the flooded area during the winter (23). Although large numbers of seedlings can become established after good seed years, under fully stocked stands most die within 5 years because of their shade intolerance. Even under these conditions, however, a few individuals may live as long as 30 years, although they grow very slowly and frequently die back and resprout (22). When established first-year seedlings are subjected to shallow flooding (tops and leaves above water) during the growing season, root growth ceases, some secondary roots die, and almost no adventitious roots are formed. Although growth during flooding is poor and recovery after flooding may be slow, seedling survival to such shallow flooding for as long as 84 days is high (7). Pin oak seedlings survive complete inundation (tops and leaves under water) for only 10 to 20 days during the growing season. They are classified as intermediate in tolerance to growing season shallow flooding along with cottonwood, sycamore, and silver maple; but they are less tolerant than water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), green ash, and black willow (Salix nigra) (13,14). Neither shallow flooding nor complete inundation during the dormant season has an adverse effect on pin oak seedlings (4). Vegetative Reproduction- Pin oak sprouts vigorously from stumps of young trees, and, if the origin of the sprouts is low on the stump, the incidence of decay from the parent stump is low. After physiological die-back or injury to the top, young seedlings sprout readily from dormant buds on the stem or root collar (22).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pin Oak,quercus,palustris,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Pin oak grows rapidly. In well-stocked, even-aged bottomland stands in southeastern Missouri, pin oak crop trees averaged 28 cm (11 in) in d.b.h. and 20 rn (65 ft) in height at age 30, and more than 40 cm (16 in) in d.b.h. at age 50. On good bottomland sites, stands normally reach heights of 24 to 27 m (80 to 90 ft) and diameters of approximately 60 cm (24 in) by 75 years, and individual trees may eventually attain heights of 37 m (120 ft) and diameters of 150 cm (60 in) (22,26). Pin oak responds rapidly to thinning. After release, pin oak crowns expand quickly to occupy the additional growing space, and diameter growth increases rapidly. Net annual growth on plots thinned at age 37 in southern Illinois was 8.8 m³/ha (125 ft³/acre). At age 40 these stands had 42.0 m³/ha (3,000 fbm/acre) in trees 27 cm (10.6 in) in d.b.h. and larger and were growing at a rate of 4.2 m³ to 7.0 m³/ha (300 to 500 fbm/acre) per year. Typical 60- to 70-yearold bottomland pin oak stands yield 112 to 168 m³/ha (8,000 to 12,000 fbm/acre) of merchantable sawtimber. Growth of pin oaks on upland till-plain sites is much less than on bottom-land sites (22). Pin oak is a short-lived species and reaches physiological maturity at 80 to 100 years. Little is known about maximum ages attained, but in one old-growth stand in Kentucky trees averaged 138 years of age (6,22). Pin oak is strongly excurrent in growth form, and even open-grown trees maintain a well-defined main trunk through most of the crown. Trees grown in forest stands have narrow -crowns, but open-grown trees develop wide, symmetrical crowns in which the upper branches bend upward, the midcrown branches are horizontal, and the lower branches bend downward. This characteristic branching habit gives the tree a distinctive pyramidal shape. Pin oak is not self-pruning. Many of the lower bole branches remain alive on open-grown trees, and although most of these branches die in closed stands, the dead branches are retained for many years. This characteristic causes many small ""pin knots"" in the lumber and gives the species its common name. (Some authorities ascribe the derivation of the common name to the prevalence of short, pinlike branches on the main lateral limbs (11)). Pruning removes these lower branches, but its benefit is partially offset by the subsequent development of new epicormic sprouts. Twelve years after the first 4.9-m (16-ft) log was pruned on 30-year-old trees in evenaged stands in southeastern Missouri, pruned trees have less than one-fourth as many branches as unpruned trees (6.1 compared to 25.6 branches) (18). Rooting Habit- In well-aerated soils, pin oak seedlings initially develop a strong taproot. As the trees become older, however, the root system loses this configuration and becomes more fibrous. When transplanted, bare-root seedlings and small saplings of pin oak quickly regenerate an extensive, fibrous root system (7,24). Reaction to Competition- Pin oak is classed as intolerant of shade. It is less tolerant than elm, boxelder (Acer negundo), sweetgum, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and ash but is more tolerant than eastern cottonwood and black willow. Pin oak usually grows in even-aged stands of dominant and codominant trees; intermediate and suppressed trees in such stands usually die within a few years of being overtopped. Single pin oaks in mixed stands usually are dominants. Pin oak is considered a subclimax species; it persists, however, on heavy, wet soils because it produces an abundance of reproduction which, if released, grows faster on these sites than most of its competitors (22,29). Damaging Agents- Although pin oak is very tolerant of dormant-season flooding, it is much less tolerant of growing-season flooding and trees may be injured or killed by intermittent growing-season flooding over several successive years. The trees can usually survive one growing season of continuous flooding but will be killed by continuous flooding over 2 or 3 consecutive years (2,4,10,22). Pin oak is rated as ""intermediately tolerant"" to growing season flooding, along with such species as sugar maple (Acer saccharum), river birch (Betula nigra), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), and Shumard oak (Q. shumardii); it is less tolerant than red maple, silver maple, sweetgum, sycamore, swamp white oak, and American elm (tolerant) and eastern cottonwood, green ash, and black willow (very tolerant) (28,29). Dormant-season flooding for 20 years in a greentree reservoir in southeastern Missouri did not appear to damage pin oak trees, but did reduce stand basal area growth by 10 percent (26). However, in this same area approximately 5 years later (i.e., after 25 years of flooding), many, of these trees had developed bole swellings at and just above the average flood water level. These swellings caused longitudinal fissures in the bark up to 10 cm (4 in) wide, thereby exposing the bole xylem to decay organisms. The cause of this phenomenon is unknown, but it appears to be associated with the continuous dormant-season flooding, because pin oaks in adjacent areas subject only to intermittent natural flooding were not similarly affected (27). The bark of pin oak is relatively thin and the species is therefore especially susceptible to damage by fire and the decay associated with fire wounds (12,22). Pin oak is subject to most of the diseases of oaks including oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) and is particularly susceptible to a leaf blister fungus (Taphrina caerulescens), a shoot-blight and twig canker fungus (Dothiorella quercina), and pin oak blight (Endothia gyrosa) (12). Pin oak is also host to many of the common oak-feeding insects including many defoliators, wood borers, gall wasps, and acorn weevils. Pin oak is classified as a ""most preferred"" host for gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) (15), and is also especially susceptible to the obscure scale (Melanaspis obscura), oak leaftier (Croesia semipurpurana), pin oak sawfly (Caliroa lineata), scarlet oak sawfly (C.quercuscoccineae), the sawfly Calinoa petiolata, the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), a leafroller (Argyrotaenia quercifoliana), the homed oak gall wasp (Callirhytis cornigera), and the gouty oak gall wasp (C. quercuspunctata). Thousands of acres of pin oak stands in southern Illinois have been severely damaged over the past 25 years by outbreaks of the horned oak gall wasp and the forest tent caterpillar (1,31,32,33). Ornamental pin oaks planted on alkaline soils often develop foliar chlorosis (yellowing) which, if severe, can kill the tree. This chlorosis was previously thought to be a simple iron deficiency, but recent research has indicated that it is a more complex phenomenon involving reduced foliar concentrations of one or more of the micronutrients Fe, Mn, or Zn, often in association with increased foliar concentrations of one or more of the macronutrients P, K, or Mg. In most cases, this problem can be easily corrected by soil applications of sulfuric acid. Chlorosis is not a problem in natural stands of pin oak which occur on more acidic soils (20,21).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pin Oak,quercus,palustris,hardwood,14,0
"Pin oak grows primarily on level or nearly level, poorly drained alluvial floodplain and river bottom soils with high clay content (order Entisols). Pin oak is usually found on sites that flood intermittently during the dormant season but do not ordinarily flood during the growing season. It does not grow on the lowest, most poorly drained sites that may be covered with standing water through much of the growing season. It does grow extensively on poorly drained upland ""pin oak flats"" on the glacial till plains of southwestern Ohio, southern Illinois and Indiana, and northern Missouri (order Alfisols). Because of the level topography and presence of a claypan in the soil, these sites tend to be excessively wet in the winter and spring (22).",Soils and Topography,Pin Oak,quercus,palustris,hardwood,15,0
"Pin oak acorns are an important food for mallards and wood ducks during their fall migration. Pin and other bottom-land oaks are the primary tree species in bottom-land duck-hunting areas (greentree reservoirs) that are artificially flooded during the fall and winter to attract migrating waterfowl (19). Pin oak acorns are also an important food for deer, squirrels, turkeys, woodpeckers, and blue jays. The wood of pin oak is similar to that of northern red oak, and pin oak lumber is marketed under the general designation of ""red oak."" The occurrence of numerous small knots in the wood of many pin oak trees limits its use for high quality products, however (11). Pin oak transplants well, and because of its rapid growth, large symmetrical crown, and scarlet fall colorations, it is commonly planted as a shade or ornamental tree (24).",Special Uses,Pin Oak,quercus,palustris,hardwood,16,0
"Pinyon is a minor component of the following forest cover types (61): Bristlecone Pine (Society of American Foresters (Type 209), Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210), Rocky Mountain Juniper (Type 220), Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237), Arizona Cypress (Type 240), and Western Live Oak (Type 241). It is an integral component in Pinyon-Juniper (Type 239) over a large area. However, as the type extends westward, pinyon is replaced by singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla) in Nevada and some localities in western Utah and northwestern Arizona (4,67). Southward along the Mexican border, Mexican pinyon (P. cembroides var. bicolor), recently given separate species status as border pinyon (P. discolor), becomes the dominant tree in the woodlands (6,48,49). Common associates of pinyon over most of its range are oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) and Utah juniper (J. osteosperma); redberry juniper (J. erythrocarpa), also a one-seeded juniper, is confined to the southern portion. Alligator juniper (J. deppeana) and Rocky Mountain juniper (J. scopulorum) are also found in some localities (1,4,67). Oneseed juniper predominates in east-central Arizona and most of New Mexico, and extends into western Texas and south-central Colorado. Rocky Mountain juniper is also a common component in northern New Mexico and the western half of Colorado, but it is found over most of the woodlands as well. It usually grows at higher elevations and is seldom dominant in the stand. Utah juniper is the codominant associate in Utah, northern Arizona, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. At higher, more mesic elevations in southern and western New Mexico and westward into central Arizona, alligator juniper commonly forms a component of stands. Although pinyon-juniper woodlands consist of relatively few tree species, stands exhibit considerable diversity in appearance and composition (4). Some have nearly closed canopies of a single tree species with little or no understory vegetation. Others are open, with widely scattered pines, junipers, or both among grasses and shrubs. A typical pinyon-juniper woodland, with its many-branched trees resembling shrubs, has the appearance of a stunted coniferous forest. Any particular stand usually contains only a few different plant species, but because of the wide distribution of the type, the total flora associated with woodlands is quite varied (4,67,73). Common tree and shrub associates include: Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), gray oak (Q. grisea), shrub live oak (Q. turbinella), true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), curlleaf mountain-mahogany (C. ledifolius), antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), black sagebrush (A. nova), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), Mexican cliffrose (Cowania mexicana), Apache-plume (Fallugia paradoxa), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), Mormon-tea (Ephedra spp.), yucca (Yucca spp.), opuntia (Opuntia spp.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), and buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.).

"The pinyon-juniper type occupies the lowest and warmest forested zone in the United States, with a climate generally characterized as semiarid, and locally as dry subhumid (65). Summers are hot and winters relatively cold, especially in northern locations and at high elevations. A high percentage of clear days, intense solar radiation, and windy conditions favor high evapotranspiration rates (67). Annual precipitation, which varies widely throughout the type because of differences in elevation, topography, and geography, ranges from 250 mm (10 in) at low elevations where the type adjoins the desert or grassland vegetation to 560 mm (22 in) or higher at the upper reaches (62,67,73). Locally, amounts as high as 690 mm (27 in) have been recorded, as along the Mogollon Rim in northern Arizona (15). Seasonal distribution, which also varies considerably, is related to prevailing storm patterns. In eastern New Mexico, for example, approximately 75 percent of the annual precipitation occurs during the warm season (April through September) from storms originating in the Gulf of Mexico, whereas the percentage decreases as these summer storms lose intensity during their northwesterly movement (62). Nevertheless, summer precipitation throughout much of northern Arizona and the south-central and eastern portions of Utah is still about equal to, or slightly greater than, winter moisture (14,42). Furthermore, as much as one-third of the rainfall may occur during July and August (67). In contrast, woodlands of Nevada and northern Utah receive more precipitation during the cool season (October through March), primarily from Pacific winter and spring storms (13,14). Snow depths are not great, except at higher elevations and more northerly latitudes, but even then, melt generally occurs within a few days, especially on south-facing slopes (62). The mean annual temperature in pinyon-juniper woodlands varies from 4° to 16° C (40° to 61° F); extremes may fall to -35° C (-31° F) and reach 44° C (112° F). January means may be as low as -10° C (14° F) in the more northerly portion of the type, and about 6' C (430 F) near the southern limits. Mean July temperatures are less variable, ranging from 20° to 27° C (68° to 81° F). The frost-free period ranges from about 90 to 205 days, the shorter period typifying more northerly latitudes and higher elevations (59,67,73). Because of wide variation in temperature and the amount and distribution of precipitation, the following classification has been proposed to better characterize the climate of pinyon-juniper woodlands in Arizona and New Mexico (62):",Climate,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,2,1
"No races of pinyon have been recorded. Natural hybridization has been reported between pinyon and singleleaf pinyon in three zones common to the species-the eastern edge of the Great Basin, the mountains south of the Colorado Plateau, and areas adjacent to the Colorado River and its major drainages (44). The two species also have been artificially crossed. Pinyon and the newly described Arizona single-needle pinyon also are known to hybridize (5).",Hybrids,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,9,1
"As a codominant with juniper species (Juniperus spp.), pinyon trees predominate in pinyon-juniper woodlands of the semidesert zone, which cover nearly 24.7 million ha (61 million acres), extending from Texas to California (9). Woodlands in which pinyon is the major pine species cover about 14.9 million ha (36.9 million acres) in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Outliers in California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming contribute a relatively insignificant acreage to the total (48). However, the outlier in California has been considered a population of 2-needled individuals of single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), and more recently, a new species, California single-needle pinyon (Pinus californiarum) (5,44). - The native range of pinyon.",Native Range,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,11,1
"A form of pinyon that extends southeastward from northwestern Arizona into southwestern New Mexico in the mountains south of the Mogollon Rim has been classified as a taxonomic variety, P. edulis var. fallax (47). Others considered it a local variant of singleleaf pinyon (44). More recently, however, it has been recognized as a subspecies of a newly described species of nut pine- Pinus californiarum subsp. fallax (Arizona single-needle pinyon) (5). Practically no information is available regarding population differences of pinyon. Considering the wide range of the species and the different environmental conditions under which it grows, differences would be expected. It has been reported that seed size is relatively consistent from year to year in individual trees but varies among trees (67). Also, some trees generally produce more cones than others, and some bear larger cones with more seeds per cone.",Population Differences,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pinyon is considered monoecious, the male and female strobili being borne on the same tree (67). However, dioecy has been observed under certain environmental conditions associated with moisture stress and insect damage (23,74). Although ovulate cones require most of three growing seasons to mature, the stages of growth vary with elevation, weather, and individual trees. In general, winter buds containing the strobili primordia begin to form in August, and by October of the first year are fully formed. Bud growth the following year is resumed near the first of May for staminate cones, and about mid-May for ovulate cones. By mid-June, staminate cones are mature, and ovulate cones become visible and receptive to pollen. Pollination is completed by the end of June when cone scales close, and a period of rapid growth of cones and seed commences, terminating at the end of August. During the third year, conelets start growth about the first of May, and fertilization occurs in early July. Shortly thereafter, cones and seeds reach full size, and seed coats darken and harden. Seeds mature early in September, and cone opening begins during mid-month and extends for about a 50-day period. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees reach cone-bearing age when relatively young: 25 years old and 1.5 to 3.0 m (5 to 10 ft) tall. Seeds are not produced in quantity, however, until age 75 to 100, but the long-lived pinyons continue to bear for a few centuries. A mature pinyon usually has a broad and rounded or irregular crown, which is often almost as wide as the tree height. Such trees are the heaviest seed producers, since cones are found mostly in the upper half of the crown near the ends of branches. Each cone contains about 10 to 20 seeds, which average only 4,190/kg (1,900/lb) because of their large size. A large tree in a good crop year may yield over 9.1 kg (20 lb) of seed, and better stands will produce an estimated 336 kg/ha (300 lb/acre). Germinative capacity of seeds may range between 83 and 96 percent; germinative energy is about 80 percent in 7 days (9,30,67,68). Cone crops are either good or poor, often with cones practically absent, but seldom intermediate (67). Although good crops tend to be localized and occur at irregular and infrequent intervals, some are found nearly every year somewhere over the widespread range of the species. Furthermore, cone bearing tends to be synchronous over large geographical areas, a condition considered to be an evolved mechanism to counteract seed predation (46). On an average, substantial crops are produced every 4 to 7 years, but shorter intervals of 2 to 5 years elapse with individual trees or in certain localities (9). Generally, crops occur more frequently on better sites over the optimum range of pinyon than at the extreme limits. The large, wingless seeds of pinyon are not adapted to wind dissemination. Instead, seed dispersal beyond tree crowns depends upon the behavior of four corvid species of birds- Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, scrub jay, and pinyon jay (8). Although these species eat great quantities of seed during the fall and may be greater predators than rodents, they also cache large amounts for consumption during ensuing winter months. Some of these buried seeds are not recovered by the birds, thus providing a seed source for subsequent germination and seedling establishment, particularly if caches are located in a suitable microenvironment, such as alongside shrubs or downed trees (46). Steller's and scrub jays collect seed only from open cones. In contrast, pinyon jays and Clark's nutcrackers forage from green cones, from which seeds are deftly extracted, and then from open cones as the season progresses (8,71). Clark's nutcrackers and Steller's jays probably contribute little towards regenerating existing woodland sites because their caches are located at higher elevations in ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests or in the ecotone above pinyon-juniper woodlands (8). Thus, these species tend to expand woodlands to upper elevations. In contrast, scrub jays and pinyon jays cache seeds in woodland areas, the former in small, local territories, whereas the latter transport seeds up to 12 kilometers (7.5 mi). Pinyon jays live in flocks of 50 to 500 birds, and it has been estimated that during a substantial seed year in New Mexico, about 4.5 million seeds were cached by a single flock (46). Even scrub jays, which do not exhibit flock behavior can be important seed dispersers-a single pair of birds may harvest and cache about 13,000 seeds from a particular crop. Pinyon jays can carry an average of up to 56 seeds in an expandable esophagus. Scrub jays lack this adaption, and the amount of seed that can be transported at one time is limited to 5 or fewer seeds held in the mouth and bill. The majority of caches by pinyon and scrub jays are single-seeded, and are located in the transition zone between mineral soil and the overlying organic material (8,71). Although rodents are known to cache seed, they should not be considered effective seed dispersers because caches are located in middens or underground chambers where conditions are not suitable for germination or seedling establishment. Instead, rodents, such as cliff chipmunks, pinyon mice, and woodrats, are major predators, caching as much as 35 to 70 liters (1 to 2 bu) of good seed (46,67). Furthermore, limited data indicate that rodents consume large quantities of seeds taken from bird caches (32). It has been suggested that pinyon trees and seed eating birds have evolved coadaptive traits that enhance survival of both organisms. The seed dispersing and caching behavior of birds appears related to certain traits of the trees: large, thin-coated seeds with high energy values, different colored seedcoats that aid visually oriented seed harvesters to distinguish edible from aborted seeds, upward orientation of cone and scale angle for increased seed visibility, and prolonged seed retention in open cones because of cone orientation and deep depressions and small flanges on cone scales (70). Furthermore, the mutual dependence of birds and trees appears more complex than just their respective roles of seed dispersing and food providing agents. Gonadal activity of pinyon jays, for example, is increased before the breeding season by the combined effect of photoperiod, the appearance of cones, and a diet of seeds (46). Seedling Development- Natural regeneration is difficult to achieve, primarily because of unfavorable climatic conditions, but seed predation and heavy grazing pressure, especially by sheep and goats, also play a role (67). Although pinyon grows best in full sunlight and can germinate in the open, seedlings must be protected from the harsh environment (21,31,35,46,49). Regeneration is usually achieved in the shade of tree canopies, under shrubs such as rabbitbrush, mountain-mahogany, and sagebrush, or alongside fallen trees. Optimum germination temperature for pinyon seed is about 21° C (70° F). Germination is epigeal (68). Preliminary studies indicate that germination can be significantly improved by washing seeds for 48 hours in running tap water. Cold stratification for 30 or 60 days increases speed of germination but not the percentage. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide to suppress mold and enhance germination generally is not effective. Seeds germinate in spring and summer following dispersal, depending on soil moisture and temperature, with summer germination coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. Also, seedling establishment probably depends on an adequate moisture supply during the first summer (29,30,54,66,68). Growth throughout the seedling stage is extremely slow, often with only primary needles developing the first year, and subsequent height growth averaging 2.5 to 5.0 cm (1 to 2 in) per year (67). Vegetative Reproduction- Pinyon is not known to reproduce vegetatively.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Pinyon grows best on the higher, wetter sites of the woodland zone, just below the ponderosa pine type (40,67). At these elevations trees reach their tallest heights and tend to develop single stems. At lower elevations, in contrast, bushy and sprawling crowns are characteristic. Pinyons may be multistemmed, although to a lesser extent than junipers. They usually exhibit straight, but short and rapidly tapering boles, which diverge into many large sinuous branches. Growth of pinyon, though maintained with little loss of vigor throughout the life of the tree, is extremely slow. Height growth of saplings, for example, is only about 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) yearly, and mature trees grow even more slowly, averaging 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) per year. Diameter growth also is slow, especially on poor sites, where 80 to 100 years can elapse before diameters at breast height reach even 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in). On better soils, however, 150-year-old trees may grow to a diameter of 30 cm (12 in). Mean annual diameter growth of pinyon culminates at about 1.8 cm (0.7 in) per decade, when trees are approximately 50 years old. The gross annual increment on sample plots in northern New Mexico woodlands also reflects the slow growth rate, averaging about 0.42 m³/ha (6 ft³/acre) for pinyon alone, and 0.66 m³/ha (9.5 ft³/acre) for all species. Gross cordwood increment for all species was 0.88 m³/ha (0.14 cord/acre) (38,66,67). Pinyon is a long-lived tree, maturing in 75 to 200 years. Dominant trees in a stand are often 400 years old, and pinyons 800 to 1,000 years old have been found. Depending on the site, mature trees range between 3.0 and 15.5 m (10 to 51 ft) in height and 15 to over 76 cm (6 to 30 in) in d.b.h. Although large trees are common, especially in northern New Mexico, pinyons generally are small trees, usually less than 10.7 m (35 ft) tall and 46 cm (18 in) in diameter (66,67). The largest living pinyon recorded grows in New Mexico and measures 172 cm (68 in) in d.b.h., 21.0 m (69 ft) in height, and has a crown spread of 15.8 m (52 ft) (2). Because of the growth habit of woodland species, tree volumes are not only difficult to measure but can vary more than 300 percent for trees of the same diameter. There is less variation in well-formed trees, however, and the gross volume of a representative pinyon with a basal diameter of 30 cm (12 in) and 7.6 m (25 ft) tall is 0.22 m³ (7.7 ft³), measured to a 10-cm (4-in) top. Woodland volumes vary considerably, depending on species composition and density. In northern New Mexico and Arizona, mixed stands may contain cordwood volumes ranging from about 5.0 to 157.4 m³/ha (0.8 to 25 cords/acre), with average volumes of about 69.3 m³/ha (11 cords/acre). Cordwood volumes of nearly pure pinyon stands average about 75.6 m³/ha (12 cords/acre). Low volumes are a reflection of the small trees generally associated with woodlands. The average size tree in many New Mexico stands is only 15 cm (6 in) in diameter at ground line and about 2.7 m (9 ft) tall (16,67). The density of pinyon in woodlands varies considerably, ranging from few or none to several hundred stems per hectare. Nevertheless, the density in a typical northeastern Arizona stand averages about 235/ha (95/acre) in stems less than 7.6 cm (3 in) in d.b.h.; 200/ha (81/acre) from 7.6 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) in d.b.h.; and 89/ha (36/acre) more than 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. (67). Mixed woodlands are denser and more productive than pure stands of either pinyon or juniper, and can approach or exceed 3,459 stems/ha (1,400/acre) (9,57). The higher values have been attributed to differences in rooting habit and drought tolerance of the two species. The shallower penetrating roots of pinyons limit interspecific root competition for soil moisture in mixed stands. This, combined with the lower photosynthetic rate of pinyons compared to that of junipers at higher water stresses, allows more complete site utilization in mixed stands (10,25,57). The average number of pinyons suitable for Christmas trees varies from a few trees per acre to a fairly large number. Rooting Habit- The rooting habit of pinyon is characterized by both lateral and vertical root systems (67), but roots of pinyons less than 3 m (10 ft) tall have been traced to depths 6.4 m (21 ft) in underlying rock (25). Taproots and some laterals that penetrate downward, however, grow horizontally when they encounter an impenetrable horizon or bedrock. Laterals develop at a depth of about 15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 in) and can exceed the crown radius by a factor of two or more. Taproot growth of seedlings is rapid, averaging 17 to 27 cm (7 to 11 in) in length for 1-year-old seedlings (35). The extensive root system and relatively rapid rate of root elongation, especially of young seedlings, enhance the ability of pinyon to survive under and environments. Reaction to Competition- Pinyon is a sun-adapted plant and is classed as intolerant of shade (67). It also appears unable to compete with grasses for moisture during the seedling stage following germination (4). Secondary succession following fire or other severe disturbance in pinyon-juniper woodlands appears to follow the general successional model shown in figure 1 (3). However, the first herbaceous species to become established after a fire are often those that were present in the stand before disturbance (19). The shrub stage, often consisting of sagebrush, a common associate in the woodlands, becomes prominent after about 12 years (11). Junipers, which appear to have a wider ecological amplitude than pinyons because of their greater drought resistance, are usually the first trees to regenerate (10,12,75). They rapidly increase in density after 45 years, and dominate the site at 70 years. Thereafter, pinyons tend to succeed junipers at rates determined by available seed sources until the shrub understory is essentially eliminated. If disturbances are less severe, as when cabling, chaining, or bulldozing is used to remove tree cover for range improvement, many small surviving pinyons and junipers and newly established seedlings, reforest the site in about 2 to 3 decades (55,56,64). Under some conditions, however, natural regeneration can take much longer (60). Figure 1- Possible series and pathways of secondary succession following disturbance in pinyon-juniper woodlands (3). Considerable evidence has accumulated to show that the woodlands, especially those dominated by singleleaf pinyon, are invading areas below their historic elevational limits (3,12,17,41). Furthermore, tree density appears to be increasing in some stands that existed before the invasion period. Pinyon-juniper woodland expansion since the time of settlement has been attributed to several factors, including possible climatic changes, control of fire, increased populations of seed-dispersing birds and mammals, and reduced competition from grasses resulting from overgrazing by livestock or the allelopathic influence of juniper foliage and litter (20,39). Damaging Agents- Small pinyons 1 to 2 m (3 to 6 ft) tall are readily killed by fire, but larger trees appear more resistant. Fire is generally not a serious problem, however, because stands are open and understory fuels are sparse. Where vegetation is dense and weather conditions favorable, fire has been effective as a treatment for converting woodlands to grasslands (3,18,40). Among insects most commonly attacking the vegetative portion of trees are pinyon pitch nodule moth (Petrova albicapitana arizonensis), tiger moth (Halisidota ingens), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), pinyon sawfly (Neodiprion edulicolus), adelgid (Pineus coloradensis), pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), Arizona fivespined ips (Ips lecontei), pinyon ips (Ips confusus), pinyon needle miner (Coleotechnites edulicola), pinyon tip moth (Dioryctria albovittella), and gallmidges (Pinyonia spp., Janetiella spp., and Contarinia spp.) (22,24,27,28,63,67). The most damaging cone and seed insects include cone moths (Eucosma bobana) and the pinyon cone beetle (Conophthorus edulis). Many species of nematodes, especially in the Helocotylenchus, Tylenchus, and Xiphinema genera, are parasitic on pinyon roots, but their effect on growth in natural stands is unknown (53). A number of foliage diseases have been reported on pinyon, including needle casts (Elytroderma deformans and Bifusella saccata) and needle rusts (Coleosporium jonesii and C. crowellii) (36,67). Pinyon blister rust (Cronartium occidentale) and pinyon dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium divaricatum) cause stem diseases, the latter being considered the major pathogen of pinyon. Verticicladiella wagenerii, a root rot, is also ranked high as a damaging agent; principal heart rots are red-ring rot (Phellinus pini) and brown cubical rot (Fomitopsis pinicola). Armillaria mellea and Phaeolus schweinitzii are not particularly important diseases, but both cause root rot and butt rot.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,14,1
"Pinyon-juniper woodlands are located mainly on the more rocky plateaus, mesas, foothill terraces, and lower mountain slopes; shrubs or grasses grow on finer soils in intervening valleys, canyons, or shallow washes. Such discontinuities have been attributed to fire history and soil-related differences. The oldest pinyons are frequently found on steep, rocky sites where fire occurrence and severity are probably lower than in intervening areas, and consequently less damaging to trees (37,41,67,73). Discontinuities ascribed to soil differences may in fact be related to the greater amounts of water that coarser soils make available to the tree, as the different soils are adjacent and there are no obvious differences in climatic factors. Furthermore, pinyon-juniper woodlands are found on a wide variety of soil depths and textures that range from coarse, rocky gravels to fine, compacted clays, indicating little if any correlation between these conditions and the presence of pinyon. Depth and texture, however, could affect productivity (37,45,62,67). Woodlands also are associated with a broad range of soil Great Groups, of which Haplustalfs of the order Alfisols, Ustochrepts of the order Inceptisols, and Ustorthents of the order Entisols are the most common (37,52,76). Parent materials are equally varied. Sedimentary sandstones, limestones, and shales are most common, but materials of igneous origin, such as cinders and basalt, and those from metamorphic sources, also are found (40,62,67). In some soils, carbonates may accumulate and form a petrocalcic horizon (hardpan) that may extend as deep as 1.5 m (5 ft), but is usually much shallower. Upper layers of woodland soils generally exhibit pH values ranging from about 7 to 8.4, but at higher and wetter elevations, soils tend to be slightly acid in reaction, approaching 6.5 (31,37,43,45,69). Pinyon-juniper woodlands are found between the low plains covered by grassland, desert shrub, or chaparral vegetation and the high mountains just below the zone dominated by either submontane shrubs or ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). The lower limit of growth is probably related more to the inability of pinyon trees- especially seedlings- to tolerate water stress arising from decreasing precipitation and subsequent reduction of total moisture, rather than to soil or temperature factors. In contrast, the upper limit appears to be a function of greater biotic competition resulting from increased moisture (10,67). In elevation, the woodlands lie mostly between 1370 and 2440 m (4,500 and 8,000 ft) (67). Individual pinyons, however, may extend up to 3200 m (10,500 ft) on south- and west-facing slopes in the mixed conifer forests of Arizona (70), while scattered juniper trees may descend to 910 m (3,000 ft) (41). Although the range in any given locality is considerably narrower, the elevational band occupied by woodlands is a rather uniform span of about 610 m (2,000 ft). There is a tendency, however, for the entire band to decrease in elevation in a southeasterly direction (72). In Arizona, the majority of the type is found between 1370 and 1980 m (4,500 and 6,500 ft), whereas in Colorado, the band extends from 1830 to 2440 m (6,000 to 8,000 ft). The bulk of the woodland in New Mexico and Utah occupies a zone from 1520 to 2130 m (5,000 to 7,000 ft).",Soils and Topography,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,15,1
"Firewood is the product derived from pinyon-juniper woodlands that has been used most widely and for the longest time and it continues to be the primary energy source for the rural population of small communities in much of the Southwest (9,60). Pinyon is preferred for fuelwood since it has a higher heat value than any of its associates except the oaks and burns with a pleasing and distinctive aroma. Although pinyon has physical properties similar to those of ponderosa pine and is suitable for processing, it is not extensively used for sawn products because of poor growth form and small size (9,51). Specialized woodworking shops use pinyon for novelties, and small sawmills produce mine timbers and railroad ties. The ties are used primarily in open pit mines because of their toughness and resistance to breakage during frequent rail line shifts. Pinyon has been used for pulping in the Southwest, but only to alleviate shortages of normally used mill-residue chips and pulpwood of other species. It is also occasionally processed for charcoal. The edible nuts of pinyon are probably the most valuable product of the species and are in great demand because of their delicate flavor (9,67). Annual nut crops have been estimated to average between 454 000 and 907 000 kg (1 to 2 million lb), reaching 3.6 million kg (8 million lb) in an exceptionally productive year. Commercial crops are practically nonexistent in some years, however. Nuts are commonly sold and consumed after roasting in the shell, but small quantities are sold raw. A limited retail market exists for shelled nuts, which have also been used in candies and other confections. Pinyons have been cut for private use for Christmas trees for many years and have recently appeared on commercial lots (9). In states with large acreages of pinyon-juniper woodlands, up to 40 percent of the yearly harvest in the past has been reported as pinyon. Demand has decreased since 1960, however, when 294,000 trees were harvested, ranking pinyon as 13th nationally. The decline has been attributed to an increasing supply of other plantation-grown species and the scarcity of high-quality trees in easily accessible stands. Pinyon-juniper woodlands over the past 400 years have been, and will continue to be, grazed extensively (62). Furthermore, range improvement practices to increase forage for wildlife and livestock have removed the woodland trees over large areas. Woodland watersheds also have been mechanically cleared or chemically treated in the past, but future treatments may be limited to specific areas, because the possibility of generally increasing water yield does not appear promising (7,9,15). Pinyon-juniper woodlands provide a habitat for a varied wildlife population (26). Mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, desert cottontail, mountain cottontail, and wild turkey provide increasing hunter recreation. Pinyon nuts are a preferred food for turkeys, but in poor seed years, juniper mast is extensively consumed (58). Similarly, deer subsist on browse species, but pinyon is a common food particularly during harsh winters with deep snows (33,34).",Special Uses,Pinyon,pinus,edulis,conifer,16,1
"Pitch pine is the major component of the forest cover type Pitch Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 45) and is listed as an associate in nine other types (8): Eastern White Pine (Type 21), Bear Oak (Type 43), Chestnut Oak (Type 44), White Pine-Chestnut Oak (Type 51), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Virginia Pine-Oak (Type 78), Virginia Pine (Type 79), and Atlantic White-Cedar (Type 97). In addition to the species named in the types, pitch pine associates are Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens), gray birch (Betula populifolia), post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), southern red oak (Q. falcata), various hickories (Carya spp.), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), red maple (Acer rubrum), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). According to the Forest Survey, pitch pine types cover 9 900 ha (24,500 acres) in New Hampshire, 85 400 ha (211,000 acres) in Massachusetts, 1200 ha (3,000 acres) in Rhode Island, possibly 44 500 ha (110,000 acres) in New York, more than 121 400 ha (300,000 acres) in Pennsylvania, and more than 283 300 ha (700,000 acres) in New Jersey. Other Northeastern States contain fewer hectares of this species, though about 187 400 ha (463,000 acres) in Maryland and 346 000 ha (855,000 acres) in West Virginia were classified in the Forest Survey as having pitch pine-Virginia pine-hardwood stands. However, in these two States, the Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) component greatly exceeds pitch pine in most stands (9). Usually, the most common shrubs growing with pitch pine on upland sites are lowbush blueberries (often Vaccinium vacillans or V. angustifolium) and black huckleberry and dangleberry (Gaylussacia baccata and G. frondosa). Some stands include bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia), dwarf chinkapin oak (Q. prinoides), and mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Lowland sites where pitch pine predominates have a variety of shrubs. Common ones include sheeplaurel (Kalmia angustifolia), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), staggerbush (Lyonia mariana), inkberry (Rex glabra), dangleberry, highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), and swamp-honeysuckle (Rhododendron viscosum) (9).",Associated Forest Cover,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,1,1
The climate in the range of pitch pine is humid. Average annual precipitation is usually between 940 and 1420 mm (37 and 56 in) and is well distributed throughout the year. Length of the frost-free season ranges from 112 to 190 days and temperatures range from winter lows of -40° C (-40° F) in the northern part of the range to summer highs of more than 38° C (100° F) in most sections (9).,Climate,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,2,1
"Based on isozyme analysis, only a small percentage of genetic diversity in pitch pine appears to be due to seed source. Most variation appears to be due to differences between individuals within populations. The dwarf populations of the New Jersey Pine Plains are essentially identical in genic constitution to tall trees of the Pine Barrens, at least for the allozyme loci sampled. Whatever factors are responsible for the dwarf size of these populations, they have not resulted in detectable changes in allozyme frequencies among populations (10). Provenance/progeny tests of 156 trees in 17 natural stands of pitch pine distributed over the Atlantic coastal plain from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to Cape May, New Jersey, were established in central New Jersey. Trees from southern seed sources grew faster than those from northern seed sources but adaptation of all sources decreased with increasing distance from the seed source. Variation among families within these 17 provenances was negligible (14). There is an apparent contradiction between growth in provenance/progeny trials and isozyme analysis in different populations of pitch pine in central New Jersey (10). The isozyme studies seem to indicate that variation is due to differences between individuals, while the provenance/progeny trials suggest that variation in this species is due to seed source and not differences among families within a provenance. Whether to select provenances or individuals within provenances for tree improvement programs therefore is still an open question. The differing cone-opening characteristics discussed earlier seem to be inherited, and trees at each extreme perhaps should be considered as separate races or ecotypes. When pitch and shortleaf pines grow together, natural crossing may occasionally occur. Trees with intermediate characteristics have been seen in southern New Jersey, and similar trees have been reported in southern Pennsylvania (9). At Placerville, CA, the Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station crossed pitch pine with shortleaf, pond, Table Mountain, and loblolly pines. Pitch x loblolly hybrids (P. x rigitaeda) are produced in large quantities in South Korea for commercial plantings. Early field trials in Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey showed only slight promise (9). With more careful selection of parent trees and extensive screening trials, the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station produced hybrids with exceptionally fast growth, good form, and winter hardiness for much of the natural range of pitch pine (20,21).",Genetics,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,7,1
"Pitch pine grows over a wide geographical range-from central Maine to New York and extreme southeastern Ontario, south to Virginia and southern Ohio, and in the mountains to eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia, and western South Carolina. Because it grows mostly on the poorer soils, its distribution is spotty. In the Northeast, pitch pine is most common on the sandy soils of Cape Cod, Long Island, and southeastern New Jersey, and in some sections of sandy or shallow soils in Pennsylvania (19). - The native range of pitch pine.",Native Range,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pitch pine is monoecious; pistillate flowers often occur on higher branches than the staminate flowers, but some shoots may have both types of flowers. The pistillate flowers grow in one cluster and less commonly in two clusters on a shoot, the latter as a result of polycyclic winter buds (15). Staminate flowers are yellowish, sometimes purplish, when mature, and 13 to 25 cm (about 0.5 to 1 in) long. The mature pistillate flowers are green but often show some red. They are borne on stout stalks and are 8 mm (0.33 in) long without the stalk, 20 mm (0.8 in) with the stalk. In southern New Jersey, the staminate flowers of pitch pine are visible by the third week of April; pistillate flowers usually by May 1. Pollen shedding usually occurs during the second or third week of May (9). Cones reach full size, 4 to 7 cm (1.5 to 2.8 in) long, and mature at the end of the second summer. Mature cones are 2.5 to 3.5 cm (1.0 to 1.4 in) wide when closed, 4.5 to 5.5 cm (1.8 to 2.2 in) wide when open. Closed cones are narrowly ovoid; open cones are ovoid and flattened at the base. Seed Production and Dissemination- Vigorous open-grown basal sprouts start bearing mature cones when only 3 years old. Of 400 planted 2-year-old seedlings, two bore a total of three mature cones at the end of their second growing season in the plantation (2). Potted seedlings may be even more precocious, occasionally bearing female flowers in 12 months. However, mature cones are not usually home on open-grown trees until they are 8 to 12 years old. Shade-grown trees produce cones at a later date (19). Although pitch pine is reported to bear good crops of cones at approximately 3-year intervals, production may be irregular. In southern New Jersey, good to excellent crops have occurred at intervals of 4 to 9 years. Occasionally, poor crops are borne in two successive years, although usually a poor crop is followed by fair to excellent crops for 1 to 3 years (9). Pitch pine seeds are three-angled and 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in) long, although with the wings they are 15 to 21 mm (0.6 to 0.8 in) long. Because they differ in size, the number of seeds per unit of weight varies widely- from 97,700 to 181,200/kg (42,500 to 82,200/lb). In nursery practice fresh seeds need no stratification before sowing, and seeds are merely pressed in the soil at rates that produce 320 to 380 seedlings/m² (30 to 35/ft²) (27). While northern nurseries usually leave the seedlings in the seed bed for 2 years, southern nurseries lift year-old seedlings for planting. Seed dissemination is variable, depending on the length of time that cones remain closed after maturity. On some trees, the cones open soon after maturity; at the other extreme, some cones remain closed for many years, until the heat of a fire opens them or until the trees are cut. Trees of the latter type are characteristic of the areas with a long history of wildfire. Cone behavior is thought to be an inherited characteristic, but in southern New Jersey, groups of trees with different cone behavior are not widely separated geographically. When cones open soon after maturity, seed dispersal begins about November 1 and ends in April in southern New Jersey (18). The pattern of dispersal seems similar to the pattern for shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata); in one study this species dropped 69 percent of its seed the first month, and 90 percent during the first 2 months. In New Jersey, probably about 90 percent of the seeds dispersed from a pitch pine source fall on the east side because the prevailing fair-weather winds are from the west (9). On trees showing cone behavior between the two extremes, the cones open erratically within a few years after maturity. Apparently there is no fixed pattern of when, what, or how many cones open. Although equipped with large wings, pitch pine seeds usually are not carried very far by wind. On the leeward of one stand, all natural reproduction in an abandoned field was within 90 m (300 ft) (9). Seedling Development- Although it was reported that seeds from trees less than 8 years old are usually sterile, other data do not support the generalization. In a cutting test on 200 seeds from 3-year-old sprouts, 94 percent were sound. In another study, 52 percent of the seeds in two cones from 4-year-old seedlings germinated within 9 days (9). Some pitch pine seeds may remain viable in the forest floor for 1 year, but there is no evidence that they can lie over for longer periods. In one instance, after heat from a July wildfire had opened many closed cones, most of the seeds germinated the following spring, though a few lay dormant until August and germinated after rains had broken a severe dry period. In another instance, when 2,400 seed spots were sown to pitch pine in late March 1955, delayed germination in the spring of 1956 provided as many as 1.4 seedlings per spot in some treatments (9). Germination of pitch pine seeds is epigeal (27). Thick litter is unsuitable as a seedbed, even on poorly drained sites. In one study few seedlings were found in July on the thick litter of unburned sites. On similar areas treated with a severe September fire before seedfall, 16,600 to 56,300 seedlings per hectare (6,700 to 22,800/acre) were tallied on very poorly to imperfectly drained sites, and 2,200/ha (900/acre) on upland sites (21). Droughts kill many pitch pine seedlings, but those less than 2 years old are most susceptible. A summer drought in 1957 killed 81 percent of the seedlings from a 1956 direct seeding in certain plots, and on comparable sites most of the seedlings started in 1955 survived (9). At the end of the first year, shaded seedlings on upland sites usually have a height of about 2.5 cm (1 in), and a taproot 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) long with a few laterals. In contrast, vigorous open-grown 1-year-old seedlings on upland sites may have stems 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) high with a maximum height of 13 cm (5 in) and correspondingly greater root systems. On the moister, poorly drained sites, open-grown first year stems are usually 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) high with a maximum height of 20 cm (8 in). Pitch pine seedlings grow slowly for the first 3 to 5 years and then more rapidly. Some planted stands in Pennsylvania maintained an average height growth of 36 to 48 cm (14 to 19 in) between ages 6 and 17. After a seed-tree cutting in a New Jersey stand, the average height growth of dominant seedlings among the natural pitch pine reproduction was 0.5 and 0.7 m (1.5 and 2.2 ft) during the third and fourth growing seasons after the cutting, respectively (9). Deer browsing and hardwood competition both reduce pine growth rates. In one study, young pines uninjured by deer grew 0.6 to 1.2 m (2 to 4 ft) more during a 5-year period than those that had their leaders browsed two or more times. In another study, cutting back hardwood sprouts twice resulted, after 6 years, in a 1.2 m (4 ft) increase in the height growth of the largest pines (9). Vegetative Reproduction- Among eastern conifers, pitch pine has an outstanding ability to survive injury. Even if all the foliage is killed by the heat of a fire, the crown can ""green up."" If 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) of the terminal shoot is killed, a new one may develop. If the entire stem is killed, sprouts frequently start at the base (19,25). Deer may clip a seedling back to 3 or 5 cm (1 or 2 in) above the ground, and still it may live (9). Dormant buds capable of active growth when properly stimulated are the key to this recovery. Also, the thick bark gives a relatively high degree of protection to the dormant buds and to the cambium. Both pitch and shortleaf pines have these buds along the bole to an age of 60 years or more, but at such ages only in pitch pine do the buds at the base retain the potential for growth. In seedlings that have not yet developed thick bark, the lowermost buds may be protected by characteristic basal crooks in the stem that bring them into or against mineral soil on upland sites. Such buds often survive fires and produce new shoots (22,29,30). Pitch pine seedlings that cannot sprout after fires are those occasional seedlings that never develop a basal crook, and around which insufficient soil accumulates to protect the buds; those that started on sphagnum or on the deep humus layer of poorly drained sites, and around which fire burns deeper than the surface where they became established; and those too young to have well-developed basal crooks. Though some open-grown seedlings may develop such crooks in their first year, shade-grown seedlings may take 9 to 10 years (20,22). The sprouting vigor of older pitch pines varies with their life history. When single stems more than 40 years old are cut, some sprouts start but most die within 2 years. In contrast are the multi-stemmed stools that characterize some southern New Jersey localities with a history of frequent wildfires; these stools may be 60 to 90 years old and commonly have produced several generations of sprouts. The survival of new sprouts on such old stools may be associated with partial rejuvenation of the root systems (9). Although pitch pine's sprouting ability is an asset in enabling trees to survive fire or other injuries, it is also a liability from the commercial point of view. Apparently the form and growth rate of sprouts decrease markedly with increased age of the root crown after crown age reaches about 20 years. Where wildfires have occurred at frequent intervals, often stands are composed largely of slow-growing sprouts from old stools. In many other stands the stems have been deformed by past fires and manifest holes with many small branches that have developed to replace killed crowns, boles with one or more crooks or forks where terminal shoots have been killed, or trees with flat tops where no leader has developed after the last one was killed.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Pitch pine reaches a maximum age of 200 years and a maximum height of 30 m (100 ft) in Pennsylvania (13). Individual trees exceeding 350 years of age have been reported in southeastern New York. In stands it is seldom more than 24 m (80 ft) tall or 61 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. On the better sites in Pennsylvania, pitch pine maintains an average annual height growth of 0.3 m (1 ft) or more until the trees are 50 to 60 years old. The rate of height growth then starts to decline, and the trees add little to their height after they are 90 to 100 years old. On the best sites, diameter growth is 2.5 cm (1 in) in 5 years at 20 years of age, and falls to 2.5 cm (1 in) in 8 years at 90 years (9). Total volume in cubic meters is maximum in Pennsylvania at 90 years, when fully stocked even-aged stands yield 210 to 350 m³/ha (15,000 to 25,000 fbm/acre). However, mean annual growth reaches its maximum at about 30 years- 3.0 to 5.8 m³/ha (43 to 83 ft³/acre), depending on the site (9). In closed stands of seedling origin undamaged by fire, pitch pine self-prunes about as well as shortleaf pine, but in understocked stands it tends to produce somewhat larger and more persistent branches than shortleaf. Open-grown trees typically develop large spreading branches, which contribute to the rough appearance that many people associate with the species. Typical. pitch pine stands have been burned repeatedly, are understocked, and have suffered fire injury; consequently trees have either retained branches or have developed them from dormant buds along the boles. Even without the stimulus of fire, pitch pines suddenly released by heavy cutting in a stand may develop branches along the bole. Pruning of living branches also may stimulate the development of new branches from buds or short shoots (9). Rooting Habit- Root development of the older pitch pines varies with the site. On sandy, well-drained soils, trees 10 cm (4 in) and larger in d.b.h. may have vertical roots that reach depths of 2.4 to 2.7 m (8 to 9 ft), but on heavier or wetter soils the root systems are more shallow. However, even in saturated soils where water tables are less than 0.3 m (1 ft) below the surface, pitch pine roots may reach depths of 0.9 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft) on sandy sites. There, and in the swamps, pitch pine roots live and grow below the water table, and mycorrhizae occur on some of the submerged roots (9,22). Possibly because pitch pine roots so deeply, it is relatively windfirm. In Maryland, Virginia pine proved much more susceptible to windthrow than pitch pine (9). Reaction to Competition- Pitch pine is intolerant of shade. On swamp sites, it is less tolerant than Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), and on poorly drained or upland sites it is less tolerant than its common hardwood associates- blackgum, red maple, various oaks, and hickories (9). In view of its relatively low tolerance and its requirement of mineral soil for germination, pitch pine can best be maintained in stands by even-aged management with seedbed preparation and control of competing hardwoods. Fire has been largely responsible for maintaining the pitch pine type and also has been responsible for the sprout origin, comparatively slow growth, and poor form that characterize this species. One severe fire may eliminate non-sprouting associates such as white pine (Pinus strobus); repeated severe fires may eliminate such species as shortleaf pine (P. echinata) and white oak (Quercus alba) which do not produce seed at as early an age as pitch pine and bear oak. Damaging Agents- Deer, rabbits, mice, wind, snow, ice, and salt spray damage pitch pine stands. Damage by deer and rabbits is limited to small seedlings or sprouts. The most common wind damage is breakage of defective large trees. However, severe storms, such as hurricanes, also may cause much windfall damage in the oldest natural stands and in plantations more than 20 years old, especially if the planted trees are infected with root rots. Heavy wet snows or ice occasionally break leaders or branches in trees of all sizes, but open-grown stems with large branches, particularly those 2.4 to 4.6 m (8 to 15 ft) tall, seem most susceptible. Although pitch pine foliage is more resistant to salt-spray damage than that of associated species, hurricanes or gales can deposit sufficient spray to injure or kill its foliage over extensive coastal areas. Few affected pitch pines die however; the chief result is reduction in growth (4,23,27). Several fungi that attack pitch pine but usually do not cause serious or extensive damage are stem rusts such as Cronartium comptoniae, C. quercuum, C. quercuum f. sp. fusiforme, and C. comandrae (1); several needle rusts and blights such as nine species of Coleosporium, Ploioderma lethale, and P. hedgcockii; twig cankers such as Diplodia pinea; root rots such as Heterobasidion annosum; and trunk rots, chiefly Phellinus pini. Heart rot as a result of P. pini does not become important in stands until the trees are 75 years old (3,12). Many insects attack pitch pine (6). The most important are the tip moths (Rhyacionia frustrana and R. rigidana), the pitch pine looper (Lambdina athasaria pellucidaria), the sawflies (chiefly Neodiprion lecontei, N. pratti paradoxicus, and N. pinusrigidae), the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), the pine webworm (Tetralopha robustella), and the pine needleminer (Exoteleia pinifoliella). Loopers periodically cause extensive damage to pitch pine in Massachusetts; in 1954 they defoliated pines on more than 20 230 ha (50,000 acres) of Cape Cod (9).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,14,1
"Pitch pine is usually restricted to the less fertile soils-those of shallow depth, or of sandy or gravelly texture. Many of the northern stands are found on sandy outwash plains of glacial origin. The species also occupies sandy and gravelly soils of alluvial and marine origin. In the highlands of northern New Jersey, southern New York, Pennsylvania, and south through the mountains, it is most common on steep slopes, ridges, and plateaus where the soils are shallow. Generally, pitch pine grows on Spodosols, Alfisols, Entisols, and Utisols. In southern New Jersey, the pH of the A and B horizons range from 3.5 to 5. 1, and in northern New Jersey, from 4 to 4.5 (9). Pitch pine grows on sites with a wide range of moisture conditions. In southern New Jersey it is found on excessively drained, imperfectly drained, and poorly drained sands and gravels, as well as on muck soils in the white-cedar swamps. Even in the hilly regions it grows on both well drained and excessively drained slopes and in the swamps (9). In New England it is most common in the coastal districts and in river valleys. In New York it is not common above 610 m (2,000 ft), but in Pennsylvania it grows at all elevations up to the highest point in the State, 979 m (3,213 ft) (13). In the Great Smoky Mountains and vicinity, pitch pine is found at elevations between 430 and 1370 m (1,400 and 4,500 ft). In hilly sections, pitch pine often occupies the warmer and drier sites, those facing south or west (9).",Soils and Topography,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,15,1
"Pitch pine was an important tree during the days of wooden ships and iron men. Its coarse-grained wood is only moderately strong but contains a comparatively large amount of resin, weighing about 513 kg/m³ (32 lb/ft³). Consequently, the wood resists decay, which makes it particularly useful for ship building and for rough construction, mine props, fencing, and railroad ties. It is also used for pulpwood, crating, and fuel. At one time the wood was destructively distilled for naval stores (5,7). Pitch pine also serves as a food source for wildlife. Cones of pitch pine often remain on the trees unopened for several years or until the heat from a forest fire opens them. Seeds shed in mid-winter are an important source of food for squirrels, quail, and small birds such as the pine warbler, pine grosbeak, and black-capped chickadee. White-tailed deer and rabbits also browse young sprouts and seedlings (5,7).",Special Uses,Pitch Pine,pinus,rigida,conifer,16,1
"Pond pine is a major species in the forest cover type Pond Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 98) and is an associate in nine other cover types (5): 81 Loblolly Pine 82 Loblolly Pine-Hardwood 84 Slash Pine 85 Slash Pine-Hardwood 97 Atlantic White-Cedar 100 Pondcypress 102 Baldcypress-Tupelo 103 Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo 104 Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay Other associated tree species are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), and loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus). In the pocosins and very wet areas, a great variety of evergreen shrubs form a dense understory. Laurel-leaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia) is almost always present on pond pine sites. Switchcane (Arundinaria tecta) is locally abundant and, as it sprouts prolifically, it is highly favored by periodic burning. Other frequent shrub species include inkberry (Ilex glabra), large gallberry (I. coriacea), zenobia (Zenobia pulverulenta), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), and saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens).",Associated Forest Cover,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,1,1

"Distinct races of pond pine have not been identified. Pond pine hybridizes with several southern pines. Although pitch and pond pine are usually separated geographically, they readily hybridize and intergrade when found together in New Jersey and Maryland. When loblolly pine occurs in association with natural hybrids of pitch and pond pines, hybrids of the complex are frequently found (17). Pond pine also hybridizes with loblolly pine, but in most localities the flowering dates are distinct enough to restrict hybridization. Evidence of introgressive hybridization, however, has been found at several locations in the North Carolina Piedmont and Coastal Plain provinces (15).",Hybrids,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,9,1

"No definite pattern of variation was found in pond pine wood specific gravity or tracheid length associated with geographic area or depth of organic material in the coastal area of North Carolina (12). Differences in both wood traits were noted among individual plots and among individual trees, however. The average wood specific gravity of unextracted increment cores of 554 pond pine trees was 0.492 with a standard deviation of 0.049, about the same as the variation among trees in other southern pines. The oleoresin of pond pine is unique for the high proportion of limonene and low proportion of alpha- and beta-pinene. From a study of 30 traits of pond pine and loblolly pine, slight differences were reported in some Coastal Plain trees compared with those from drier, inland areas (10). Both species, however, had a general uniformity in all locations. Pond pine is included in the North Carolina State Tree Improvement Cooperative. First-generation select trees are located in four seed orchards with a total of 12 ha (29 acres) (9).",Population Differences,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pond pine is monoecious. Pollen flight and female flower receptivity occur in late March in Florida and about 1 month later in North Carolina. At any given latitude, pond pine flowering is considerably later than that of loblolly (Pinus taeda) or slash (P. elliottii) pine. It is possible that in some years the flowering period of pond pine may overlap with other southern pines, but hybridization occurs infrequently. Cones ripen in September and October. Seed Production and Dissemination- Cone production may begin at an early age in pond pine. In eastern North Carolina pocosins, trees less than 10 years old (d.b.h.) produced an average of eight cones per tree. Cone production increased with age and diameter up to 30 years. Seed trees over 30 years (d.b.h.) produced an average of 175 to 200 cones (19). Mature cones are normally 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long and remain on the tree for as long as 10 years. Because the cones are serotinous, only a few seeds are released at maturity each year, and the seed crop of several years may be present in an individual cone bearing tree. Viability does not decrease in cones that remain closed for as long as 3 years. Cones open gradually over several years, with two seasonal periods of seed dissemination: April through September and October through January (4). Like other pine species with serotinous cones, pond pine cones open and release seeds soon after exposure to heat from fire. The intensity of heat does not adversely reduce the viability of seeds; even badly charred cones, following wildfires, release seeds that are capable of germination. In an uncut but burned stand of pond pine, 131,000 seeds per hectare (53,000/acre) were trapped in a 6-week period following the burn. Mature cones can be opened by exposure to 167° to 169° C (333° to 336° F) dry heat for 30 seconds or by immersion in boiling water for a similar period. An average of 75 to 80 developed seeds are produced per cone and 77 percent of these can usually be extracted. Germination of pond pine seed from North Carolina averaged 44 percent of the extractable seed (including both filled and empty seed) after 60 days (19). Pond pine seeds are relatively small, ranging from 104,000 to 139,000/kg (47,000 to 63,000/lb) and averaging 119,000/kg (54,000/lb). Seeds are winged and can be dispersed a horizontal distance several times the height of parent trees. Seedling Development- Adequate moisture is normally available for pond pine germination in the peat and organic soils of the Coastal Plain. Seeds also germinate well on exposed mineral soil. Establishment of seedlings, however, is much better if the competition from weeds, grass, and woody vegetation is reduced by mechanical site preparation or by the use of fire. Germination is epigeal. Without question, fire has been a major influence on the perpetuation of pond pine in coastal regions of the Southeastern United States. The majority of present-day stands date to a previous wildfire. For natural regeneration, prescribed fires reduce the dense understory of shrubs, prepare a seedbed, and open the serotinous cones. Research in eastern North Carolina indicated that seedling establishment was most favorable in plots that were burned before clearcutting. Clearcutting before burning was also favorable for establishment of an adequate number of free-to-grow seedlings (4). In another study, a headfire was more effective than a flanking fire in the establishment of seedlings. Techniques for the use of successful prescribed fire for the regeneration of pond pine have been outlined (18). Fires must generally be of high intensity to consume understory shrubs, yet not so intense that serious damage or mortality occurs to the overstory pines. There is usually only a narrow range of weather and fuel conditions where silvicultural objectives and controlled fire can be attained in a given pocosin. Key elements in a prescribed fire plan include light to moderate winds with relative humidities between 35 and 50 percent. The water table also should be close to the surface to prevent spotting and burning of the organic soils. Seed for regeneration may be provided by seed trees. If seed trees are 23 to 25 cm (9 to 10 in) in d.b.h. and 30 years old, each tree can be expected to produce 5,000 sound seeds. On this basis, 15 to 20 seed trees per hectare (6 to 8/acre) are required to provide adequate seed for establishment. Scarification with fire plows, disks, or logging equipment is sometimes effective in securing seedling establishment but is not as reliable as burning because without heat from a fire seedfall is limited by the serotinous cones of pond pine. Pond pine seedling growth frequently is limited by excessive soil moisture, low nutrition, and competition from herbaceous and woody vegetation. Under the most severe conditions, seedlings grow only 30 cm (12 in) or less per year. In a pond pine study in a pocosin, seedlings required an average of 18 years to reach a height of 1.5 m (5 ft). The fastest growing seedlings reached this height in less than 10 years (19). Vegetative Reproduction- Among pine species, pond pine is unique in that it sprouts readily from stumps until quite old. Seedlings or saplings will sprout prolifically when cut, and older trees will sprout vigorously along the stem and branches after intense scorching and defoliation by fire. These sprouts arise from dormant buds in the axils of primary needles of young seedlings. The buds are dormant and are protected by the bark. When the tree is injured, these buds resume growth and may give rise to clusters of buds and numerous short shoots (19). Not all buds, formed at intermediate and wintergrowth flushes, sprout the following spring. Those that do not sprout remain alive; they sometimes develop into short, weak branches and give rise to many lateral buds. They may also put forth secondary dormant buds directly without growing into branches. Buds may also form in needle fascicles, but these are of little importance in the sprouting of pond pine because they are present for only a short time. Thus, pond pine stems and branches bear many clusters of dormant buds that remain alive and capable of sprouting for many years. When trees are defoliated by fire, these buds sprout and give the stems and branches a feathery appearance. Stem sprouting is one of the primary reasons for the low quality of pond pine in frequently burned areas (19).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Pond pine grows surprisingly well on the better sites with soils that have good internal drainage. In fact, pond pine may be difficult to distinguish from loblolly pine in the sapling stage when in natural or planted stands on comparable upland sites. More typically, however, pond pine is found in the pocosins where it grows very slowly. Average sizes of pond pine in a North Carolina pocosin were as follows: Stands of pond pine normally have low volumes with seldom over 70 m³/ha (5,000 fbm/acre). The trees in these stands usually have been repeatedly burned and have poor form and low quality (19). A well-stocked stand of pond pine at 50 years of age with a site index of 21 m (70 ft) may be expected to have 25.9 m²/ha (113 ft²/acre) of basal area and 860 trees per hectare (348/acre), with an average d.b.h. of 19.6 cm (7.7 in). The entire stand might have 179 m³/ha (2,560 ft³/acre) of wood inside the bark or 195 m³/ha (31 cords/acre) of merchantable wood. The total wood volume per hectare could also be allocated as 51.8 m³ of sawtimber (3,700 fbm/acre) and an additional 146 m³/ha (23.2 cords/acre) of pulpwood (16). Pond pine stands with a site index of more than 27 m (90 ft) at age 50 have been measured. These stands could yield 129 m³/ha (9,200 fbm/acre) of sawtimber and 151 m³/ha (23.9 cords/acre) of pulpwood. Subsoil texture is directly correlated with site index. Height growth increases with increasing amounts of fine particles (silt and clay) in the subsoil. Other soil properties that are inversely related to site index include depth to mottling, percent of organic matter in the surface soil, and total depth of organic matter (1). Rooting Habit- No information is currently available. Reaction to Competition- Pond pine is classed as a species intolerant of shade. It is almost as intolerant as loblolly pine, but less tolerant than slash pine and more tolerant than longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). Pond pine responds favorably to drainage. In an eastern North Carolina site, basal area and height growth of pond pine were nearly doubled by drainage (6). On mineral soils, pond pine is an intermediate stage in plant succession. As it is established primarily after fire, it may grow in pure even-aged stands until harvesting or mortality removes the dominant trees. Pond pine stands yield eventually to wetland hardwood species including oaks (Quercus spp.), gums (Nyssa spp.), hickories (Carya spp.), and magnolias (Magnolia spp.). In the pocosins, pond pine follows Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) when the cedar is killed by fire, but cedar may become reestablished. Fire maintains pond pine as a subclimax type through sprouting or by stimulating seed dissemination from the serotinous cones. Repeated fires during the dry season, however, may completely eliminate pond pine and produce a grass-sedge bog or savannah. In some large pocosins, woody shrubs, including cyrilla, redbay (Persea borbonia), and gallberry may completely dominate the site for a considerable time. Almost all stands of pond pine originate from natural regeneration and the species has only infrequently been planted. In a study in the South Carolina Coastal Plain, southern pines were planted on a freshly burned site. The planting site was poorly drained, with a seasonably high water table. After 10 years, slash pine trees averaged 3.6 m (11.8 ft), and pond pine 2.3 m (7.5 ft). This study suggested that the growth of pines on the site was limited by poor nutrition and soil aeration (8). Damaging Agents- The most serious disease of pond pine is red heart (Phellinus pini), which is common in most of the older pocosin stands. On the Hofmann Forest in eastern North Carolina, 90 to 95 percent of the older pond pines are infected. P. pini is a white rot fungus which occurs relatively high in the bole of the tree. It primarily dissolves the lignin of the cell walls, while cellulose is relatively unaffected. Red heart reduces the value of pond pine lumber to such an extent that many stands of sawtimber-size trees may be sold for pulpwood only; and even pulpwood yields are reduced in the severely infected trees (14). Pond pine is subject to both fusiform rust (Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme) and eastern gall rust (C. quercuum), which cause stem and branch cankers on pines and have alternate stages on oaks. In a study of three half-sib families of pond pine, significant differences were observed in rust susceptibility. Pond pine was only half as susceptible to fusiform rust as loblolly pine (13). Comandra blister rust, caused by the fungus Cronartium comandrae, has been found on pond pine planted in Tennessee (3). The needle cast fungus (Hypoderma lethale) and brown-spot fungus (Scirrhia acicola) sometimes cause browning and foliar damage to needles but severe damage is uncommon. Coleosporium spp. may attack the foliage but have little effect on tree growth. Pond pine is also attacked by the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), the black turpentine beetle (D. terebrans), and engraver beetles (Ips spp.). In natural stands, numerous pests attack cones and seeds and reduce the final seed crop. Specific insects known to damage pond pine cones and seeds are Dioryctria spp. and Leptoglossus corculus. During drought periods, the fire hazard of pond pine sites is extremely high because of the heavy fuel accumulation in the dense understory. Dry fuel weights of the understory and litter layer are frequently more than 22.4 t/ha (10 tons/acre). When fires occur in pocosin areas the excessive fuel and large areas of unbroken forest make fire control extremely difficult. Very intense fires consume not only the trees, shrubs, and litter, but the peat soils as well.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,14,1
"The lower terraces of the Coastal Plain in the Southeastern United States are characterized by sandy and organic soils. Typical soils are in the Ultisols order, Aquults suborder, Albaquults and Umbraquults great groups. These soils usually have a dark gray, sandy loam surface soil and a heavy subsoil. The entire area has minor topographic relief and is interspersed with major drainage systems that are frequently very broad. Throughout the region are numerous streams, swamps, pocosins, marshes, and bays that are characterized by poorly developed drainage patterns. The pocosins, in particular, have unique topographic features in the Carolinas. These areas are upland bogs with streams draining from them on all sides. The pocosins have a considerable peat accumulation, frequently as deep as 2 m (6 ft). Also, in the southeastern Coastal Plain there are shallow, poorly drained depressions called bays or ponds. Pond pine is frequently found as the major overstory species in these pocosins and bays in association with a heavy understory of shrubby vegetation. Although pond pine is most frequently found on poorly drained lands, the species can make excellent growth on mineral soils or on land that is not continuously waterlogged. The slow growth of pond pine is primarily a function of prolonged water saturation and reduced soil aeration. Poor aeration retards decay of organic material and results in the accumulation of muck and peat with high acidity. Although availability of mineral nutrients is usually adequate, nitrogen fixation and nitrification proceed very slowly. Consequently, the amount of available nitrogen is small even though total nitrogen content is high in the undecayed organic matter. Soil saturation also deprives roots of the oxygen required for respiration and growth and tends to keep the soil temperature low (19).",Soils and Topography,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,15,1
"Although pond pine has poor form and slow growth, it produces forest stands of pulpwood and sawtimber where other species will not grow. The pocosins and pond pine stands are considered a major wildlife sanctuary for many wetland species.",Special Uses,Pond Pine,pinus,serotina,conifer,16,1
"Ponderosa pine can be either a climax or a seral species (18,27,47,61). It is a climax species at the lower limits of the coniferous forests, and a seral species in higher elevation mesic forests where more competitive conifers are capable of growing. In climax forests, ponderosa pine stands often contain many small, even-aged groups rather than a true uneven-aged structure. Fires have had a profound effect on the distribution of ponderosa pine. Although the seedlings are readily killed by fire, larger trees possess thick bark, which offers effective protection from fire damage. Competing tree species, such as grand fir (Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir, are considerably less fire tolerant, especially in the sapling and pole size classes. Ponderosa pine, therefore, was able to maintain its position as a dominant seral species on large areas of middle-elevation forests in the West. Because of successful fire control during the past 50 years, many of these stands have developed understories of Douglas-fir and true firs. Type conversion has been accelerated by harvest of the ponderosa pine, leaving residual stands composed of true fir, Douglas-fir or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) (15,20). In the Pacific Northwest, forest cover types on about 2 million ha (5 million acres) are believed to have changed in the last 25 years (3). Ponderosa pine is an integral component of three forest cover types in the West: Interior Ponderosa Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 237), Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244), and Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245) (18). Interior Ponderosa Pine is the most widespread type, covering most of the range of the species from Canada to Mexico, and from the Plains States to the Sierra Nevada, and the east side of the Cascade Mountains. Ponderosa pine is also a component of 65 percent of all western forest cover types south of the boreal forest. Major associated tree species are as follows: Northwest. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), lodgepole pine, grand fir, and western larch (Larix occidentalis). California. California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana), incense-cedar, Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), sugar pine, coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), California black oak (Quercus kelloggii), and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Rocky Mountains and Utah. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, blue spruce (Picea pungens), lodgepole pine, limber pine (Pinus flexilis), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Black Hills. Quaking aspen, white spruce (Picea glauca), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera). Arizona and New Mexico. White fir (Abies concolor var. concolor), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, blue spruce, quaking aspen, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelli), and southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiformis) at higher elevations; Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum), alligator juniper (J. deppeana), and Utah juniper (J. osteosperma) at lower elevations. Genera of understory vegetation frequently found in ponderosa pine forests are as follows: Shrubs. Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Purshia, Artemisia, Quercus, Rosa, Prunus, Spiraea, Symphoricarpos, Physocarpus, and Berberis. Grasses. Agropyron, Andropogon, Bouteloua, Festuca, Muhlenbergia, and Poa. Community composition varies widely with geographic location, soils, elevation, aspect, and successional status. Specific information is available in descriptions of various habitat and community type classifications (1,20,23,27,35,47,61,63).",Associated Forest Cover,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,1,1
"Throughout the range of ponderosa pine, soil moisture is the variable most often limiting growth, especially in summer when rainfall is deficient. For the east slope of the Rockies, the Black Hills, Utah, and the Southwest, however, summer rains occur, although the Southwest regularly experiences scanty May-June precipitation. In eastern Oregon and Washington, average annual precipitation ranges from 355 to 760 mm (14 to 30 in), much of it snow (30). July, August, and September are dry; average rainfall is less than 25 mm (1 in). In Montana, east of the Continental Divide, average annual precipitation in ponderosa pine forests ranges from 280 to 430 mm (11 to 17 in), with 125 to 250 mm (5 to 10 in) received during the May-to-August period (1). In the Black Hills of South Dakota, average annual precipitation is 410 to 710 mm (16 to 28 in), with up to 330 mm (13 in) received from May to August (67). In northern Arizona, 150 mm. (6 in) of the total growing season precipitation of 205 mm (8 in) occurs in July and August, after the May-June dry period. The west slope of the northern Sierra Nevada in California, where annual rainfall reaches 1750 mm (69 in), may be the wettest area supporting ponderosa pine in any quantity (13). The extent of the seasonal rainfall deficiency is evident from the July and August precipitation, usually about 25 mm (1 in) or less; in some places, as in California, July and August precipitation is often lacking. Except on coarse-textured soils, summer showers probably provide scant moisture useful to young seedlings. Total growing season precipitation may mean little because of the distribution pattern (13). Regardless of the location where ponderosa pine grows, average annual temperatures are between 5° and 10° C (41° and 50° F), and average July-August temperatures are between 17° and 21° C (62° and 70° F). Average frost-free seasons for ponderosa pine range from 90 to 154 days in eastern Montana and South Dakota (1,63) to more than 200 days in central California. Annual extremes are from -40° to 43° C (-40° to 110° F).",Climate,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,2,1
"Natural crosses of ponderosa pine with Jeffrey pine have been observed in California where their ranges overlap, but they are rare. Where the two species grow in the same stand, different flowering times and other reproductive barriers restrict crossing (11). Ponderosa pine crosses with Pinus montezumae and P. arizonica, and rarely with P. engelmannii (45). Introgressive hybridization has been observed with P. washoensis. In addition to the natural hybrids, artificial crosses have been obtained with a number of other hard pine species, including P. durangensis.",Hybrids,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,9,1
"The range of ponderosa pine extends from southern Canada into Mexico, and from the Plains States of Nebraska and Oklahoma to the Pacific Coast. Pacific ponderosa pine (var. ponderosa) ranges from latitude 52° N. in the Fraser River drainage of southern British Columbia, south through the mountains of Washington, Oregon, and California, to latitude 33° N. near San Diego. In the northeast part of its range it extends east of the Continental Divide to longitude 110° W. in Montana, and south to the Snake River Plain, in Idaho (1,51). Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine (var. scopulorum) extends east of the Continental Divide from latitude 48° N. in north-central Montana, southeasterly into North and South Dakota, eastern Wyoming, and as far east as north-central Nebraska. Within this area, ponderosa pine grows on the discontinuous mountains, plateaus, canyons, and breaks of the plains, with the most extensive stands found in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming (51). South of Wyoming, Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine extends south on both sides of the Continental Divide, west to Arizona, and the eastern edge of the Great Basin in Nevada, east to Texas west of the Pecos River, New Mexico, extreme northwestern Oklahoma, Colorado, and northern Mexico (36). Within this wide range, ponderosa pine is absent from a large area that includes southwestern Montana, western Wyoming, southern Idaho, and part of the Great Basin (12,61). A possible explanation for the absence is that the distribution of rainfall during the summer months prevents seedling establishment except at higher elevations, where the species has little tolerance for the shorter growing season (61). Arizona pine (var. arizonica) is found primarily in the mountains of extreme southwestern New Mexico, southeastern Arizona, and northern Mexico (36). - The native range of ponderosa pine.",Native Range,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,11,1
"Ponderosa pine shows distinct geographic variations over its widespread range. Within and between var. ponderosa and var. scopulorum, provenance studies (51,65,66) have shown genetic variation in growth, stem form, needle length, survival, initiation of leader growth, seasonal pattern of root growth potential, ability to germinate under moisture stress (41), biotic and abiotic damage (17,26,52), monoterpene production (58), nutrient status (29,68), and isozymes (10). This wealth of information on genetic diversity was summarized and interpreted recently (10). It suggests that var. ponderosa consists of three major geographic races and var. scopulorum of two major geographic races. Within var. ponderosa, the Pacific race is found in California northward from the Transverse Ranges and west of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range into northern Oregon. Pacific race pines have relatively large needles, cones, and seeds, and are rapid growing and least cold hardy in tests to date. The North Plateau race extends northward along the eastside of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range and east to the Continental Divide in Montana. Like the Pacific race, it has open, plume-like foliage, 3-needle fascicles and isozyme characteristics. But the North Plateau race has needles with thickened layers of hypoderm and sunken stomata, and is indistinguishable from the Rocky Mountain race in monoterpene characteristics. Least well understood, but distinct in monoterpene production, is the Southern California race. Within var. scopulorum, the Rocky Mountain race comprises the northeast portion of the species' range. It is characterized by compact foliage, 2-needle fascicles, and better growth in trials east of its natural range. The Rocky Mountain race joins the Southwestern race along a broad, ill-defined front through southern Colorado, Utah, and Nevada. The Southwestern race has relatively open foliage, low proportions of 2-needle fascicles, and resins with distinctive monoterpene composition. Results from a provenance study of 45-year-old trees in northern Idaho and a study of 30-year-old trees in Oregon and Washington (60) showed that 36 percent of the variation in the height of the trees was associated with seed source. A clinal variation was evident in the increase of height from sources in an east-to-west direction. This variation was related to September-through-June precipitation. Clinal variation in a latitudinal and altitudinal direction was related to April-May temperatures. Incidence of animal damage and of frost injury was related, also, to seed source. Ponderosa pine varies markedly in its resistance to cold. In a test of 298 individual tree progenies planted in Michigan, all 2-year-old seedlings of California origin suffered severe injury from cold (66). Progenies from British Columbia, Washington, eastern Oregon, Arizona, and southern New Mexico suffered light damage. No damage was reported for progenies from the remainder of the species' range. Essentially the same pattern was found in the northern Idaho study in 10- to 15-year-old trees (65). Elevational. variation has been studied intensively in central Idaho (53) and in California (9). On the west slope of the Sierra Nevada in California, seeds collected from trees growing at elevations of 40 to 2130 m (125 to 7,000 ft) were planted at altitudes of 290, 830, and 1720 m (950, 2,730, and 5,650 ft) above sea level. The general trend was that early growth was most rapid for mid-elevation sources and least rapid for high-elevation sources, regardless of the elevation of the plantation. But by 29 years, at the high-elevation plantation, sources from high elevations had overtaken sources from low elevations and had nearly caught up to sources from middle elevations. Middle and low elevation sources, especially the latter, suffered stem and leader damage from snow and wind, which significantly reduced their growth superiority. Wood specific gravity decreased with increasing elevation of parent source regardless of where the source was planted (16). No elevational effect was discerned in tracheid length, although individual differences were found. Differences were recognized, also, in total height and diameter, and in the seasonal growth pattern (42) for families within elevational zones. Genetic diversity among populations, both in California and central Idaho, was readily interpretable as adaptive variation. Results of both studies suggest that for selective breeding of a wide-ranging species with distinct elevational differentiation, such as ponderosa pine, superior progenies can be obtained from selection within the optimum elevational zone of best geographic sources. In central Idaho, the recommended elevational zone is ± 180 m (600 ft).",Population Differences,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Ponderosa pine is monoecious. At pollination the male strobili, borne in short, dense clusters, are 2 to 3 cm (0.8 to 1.2 in) long and female conelets are 2.5 cm (1 in) long. In western Montana, central Idaho, and eastern Oregon, at elevations from 910 to 1830 m (3,000 to 6,000 ft), flowering generally begins between May 1 and 10. Pollen is shed May 25 to June 15, cones reach a full size of 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) July 20 to August 10 of the next year, seed is ripe August 20 to September 5, cones begin to open September 1 to 13, and seed is shed until November. On the east and west sides of the Sierra Nevada in California, at an elevation of 1830 m (6,000 ft), however, cones develop about 2 weeks later (13). In northern Arizona, near Flagstaff, pollen is shed between June 10 and 20 (55), but at an elevation of 910 m (3,000 ft) on the west slope of California's Sierra Nevada, pollen has been collected as early as April 15; May 11 was average for a 7-year period. Also on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, pollen is shed an average of 8 days later for each 300 m (1,000 ft) rise in elevation (13). In Colorado, at 2710-m (8,900-ft) elevation, during a 9-year period, female conelets emerged on or about June 18 and only about 36 percent of them survived until the beginning of the second year. Flowering is correlated closely with the passing of freezing weather (13). Seed Production and Dissemination- No regular periodicity has been observed in the seed production of ponderosa pine over its entire range. In California, west of the Sierra Nevada, medium seed crops are borne on an average of every 2 to 3 years. The average interval between heavy cone crops is 8 years. Good cone crops are produced every 3 years in the Black Hills (7), every 3 to 4 years in the Southwest (55), and every 4 to 5 years in the Pacific Northwest (3). Observations over 23 years in Montana show ponderosa pine to be a poor seeder west, and a fair seeder east, of the Continental Divide, with only one good crop. The species bears cones as early as 7 years and continues to produce good seeds to at least 350 years. Seeds from trees aged 60 to 160, however, are more viable than those of younger or older trees. In California, trees more than 64 cm (25 in) in d.b.h. were the best producers. In central Idaho, mature and overmature trees growing at an elevation of 1680 m (5,500 ft) produced lower quality seeds than similar trees at 1220 m (4,000 ft), and open grown trees produced heavier crops of larger cones than stand grown trees (13). In eastern Washington, Idaho, and western Montana, 16 species of insects have been identified as causing seed losses of ponderosa pine (14). They destroyed up to 95 percent of the cone crop, but most areas sampled suffered losses ranging from 30 to 60 percent. In central Arizona, abortion, ponderosa pine cone beetles (Conophthorus ponderosae), and ponderosa pine coneworms (Dioryctria sp.) were the three most important causes of cone mortality (57). Usually the proportion of seeds lost to insects is highest when crops are small. Ponderosa pine seeds are consumed by a great many birds and small mammals such as mice, chipmunks, and tree squirrels. In years of low cone production, the potential seed crop may be severely reduced. Squirrels clip many of the cone bearing twigs, destroying flowers and conelets (13). Specific gravity of cones containing ripe seed can be predicted. Cone collectors should consult local authorities before picking, however, because specific gravity of ripe cones varies from 0.80 in Arizona to 1.00 in the Black Hills. The number of seeds per cone varies greatly among regions and ranges from only 31 seeds in northern Arizona (55) to 70 in central California (13). Weight of cleaned seeds varies from 15,200 to 50,700/kg (6,900 to 23,000/lb) and averages 26,500/kg (12,000/lb) (31). Ponderosa pine seeds are not disseminated naturally over extensive distances. In central Oregon, seedfall at 37 m (120 ft) was only 22 percent of the seedfall at the west edge of a cleared area, and at 120 m (396 ft) it was only 8 percent (3). Nearly all seeds are disseminated by early November. In a good seed year as many as 852,050 seeds per hectare (345,080/acre) may reach the ground (19). Seedling Development- Throughout ponderosa pine's range, except in the Black Hills and the west side of the Sierra Nevada, natural regeneration is sporadic. Successful natural regeneration is thought to be the result of the chance combination of a heavy seed crop and favorable weather during the next growing season. Soil texture, plant competition, and seedbed conditions are other common determinants of survival of young seedlings (13). Germination of ponderosa pine is epigeal (31). Moisture stress reduces seed germination as well as initial seedling survival and growth. In an Arizona study, seed germination, root penetration, root dry weight, and cotyledon length decreased as the stress increased beyond 0.7 MPa (7 bars) (55). Older seedlings, however, are able to cope with limited moisture supplies by reducing transpiration and by vigorously extending their root systems. Transpiration rate declines at soil water potentials of -0.1 to -0.2 MPa (-1 to -2 bars). At -1.0 MPa (-10 bars) the transpiration rate is only 12 percent of maximum (37). Ponderosa pine has the capacity for root growth in relatively dry soil. Nursery stock lifted in January in California had appreciable root elongation even when planted in soil with a water potential of less than -0.9 MPa (-9 bars) (62) and has survived, at least for short periods, water potentials of less than -8.0 MPa (-80 bars) in the Southwest (24). The significance of competing vegetation as a deterrent to early survival and development of young seedlings has been clearly demonstrated. In central Idaho, soil moisture remained above the wilting point at depths below 15 cm (6 in) on areas free of competing vegetation throughout the growing season but dropped to or below that critical point on most vegetated plots (13). In loamy soils in the White Mountains in Arizona, drought is normally not a major variable in seedling survival beyond age 2, except where there is grass cover (30). Shrub competition reduced the height and diameter growth of ponderosa pine planted in northern California (43); similar growth reductions have been reported for stands in Oregon (4). Air and soil temperatures often affect growth. Seedlings grown from seed collected in Arizona, California, and South Dakota had the best root growth in 15° C (59° F) air temperature and 23° C (73° F) soil temperature. Height growth was greatest at 23° C (73° F) temperature for air and soil (33). On the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, height growth of ponderosa pine started significantly later with each increase of 610 m (2,000 ft) in elevation, and the length of the growing season was significantly shorter with a 910 m (3,000 ft) increase in elevation. Rates of height and radial growth did not vary with elevation during the period of growth. At an elevation of 1520 m (5,000 ft), a 6-year average showed that ponderosa pine started radial growth on March 23 and height growth on April 26. The period of radial growth lasted 177 days; that of height growth, 97 days. Ponderosa pine started height growth before sugar pine, incense-cedar, and white fir, but not before lodgepole pine (13). Many variables cause seedling mortality. Ponderosa pine seedlings less than 36 days old were more susceptible to minimum night temperatures (lower than -5° C (23° F)) than were lodgepole pine seedlings. But by 2 months of age, differences in tolerance did not exist (8). During winters with little snow cover, 1- and 2-year-old seedlings suffered damage and killing from frost. In the Southwest, natural regeneration on fine-textured soils is almost non-existent because of frost-heaving (24). Damage is lessened by heavy cover and early summer germination of seeds, which gives a longer establishment period. Ordinarily, older seedlings are hardy in severe winter temperatures, but occasionally they suffer ""winter killing"" of foliage (a desiccation process) if the temperature drops suddenly when drying winds and frozen ground are present. Also, 1- to 3-month-old seedlings are killed by stem temperatures of about 54° C (130° F) and higher. Ponderosa pine is more successful in resisting high soil surface temperature with increasing age; 110-day-old seedlings can successfully withstand instantaneous temperatures of 58° to 82° C (136° to 180° F) (13). Also, it can withstand higher temperatures than its associates in the Northwest-Douglas-fir, grand fir, and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) (56). Vegetative Reproduction- Ponderosa pine does not reproduce naturally by vegetative methods. It can be propagated by rooting and grafting, but success decreases rapidly when scions are taken from trees older than 5 years (64).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Ponderosa pine grows to impressive size. Stems 263 cm (103.5 in) in d.b.h. and 70.7 m (232 ft) in height have been recorded (13). Diameters at breast height of 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in) and heights of 27.4 to 39.6 m (90 to 130 ft) are common throughout most of its range. Trees often reach ages of 300 to 600 years. Diameter growth can be rapid and remain fairly constant for long periods provided trees are given adequate growing space. In California, on productive sites, free-growing trees can reach 66 cm (26 in) in d.b.h. in 30 years or 22 cm. (8.7 in) per decade (data on file at Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Redding, CA). In central Oregon, where sites are less productive, trees 13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 in) in d.b.h. and from 19 to 36 years old can grow 12 cm (4.9 in) in d.b.h. per decade if free of intertree competition (3). Trees in a virgin stand in Arizona grew 29 mm (1.14 in) on the average during a 10-year period, but trees in a cutover stand grew 43 mm (1.68 in) (55). Vegetative competition can restrict diameter growth markedly whether it be from neighboring trees or understory shrubs. In the central Oregon study, trees completely surrounded by understory shrubs grew only 9 cm (3.5 in) per decade. Those trees with no competitive ground cover averaged 12 cm (4.7 in) of growth per decade. In California on a droughty, skeletal soil, severe shrub competition reduced diameter growth to less than half that of competition-free trees. Insect damage, which was greater on the trees competing with shrubs, accounted for some of the growth depression (44). Stagnation in diameter, and often in height, represents a serious problem in densely stocked stands throughout the species' range, but especially on poor sites. Height growth is most rapid in the pole and young sawtimber size classes to about 60 years. In the Pacific Northwest, dominant trees in stands of moderate density grow from 0.24 to 0.46 m (0.8 to 1.5 ft) annually between the ages of 20 to 60 years on timber-producing sites (2). Rate of growth declines gradually at older ages. Arizona trees of 160 years or older (determined at breast height) grow little in height (55). Height growth increases with site productivity and is more sensitive to stand density than was once believed. Representative yields of ponderosa pine from a normal yield table for sites of various productivities are given in table 1 (39). For extensive natural stands, table values should be reduced by 25 percent or more because of roads, rock outcrops, steep slopes, openings, and other unproductive areas. Old-growth ponderosa pine produces clear, high-grade lumber, but young trees typically are limby. Natural pruning develops slowly. An average clear length of only 3.5 m (11.5 ft) was recorded in 250-year-old stands in central Idaho (13). Rooting Habit- The ability of ponderosa pine seedlings to grow vigorous taproots is one reason for their tenacity on severe sites where associated species often fail. Within a few months of germination, roots can penetrate to depths of 50 cm (20 in) or more in loosened and watered soil (32). This rapid root growth is essential to ponderosa pine's apparent adaptation to the climate of the Southwest. There, seeds do not germinate until the soil is continuously warm and moist. These conditions are not present until summer rains begin, usually in July. Root growth was uninhibited by grass as long as moisture was abundant (34). Taproots penetrate to about half that depth or less under average conditions in the field. Annually, for the next 2 years, lateral roots may double or triple in length. Mature ponderosa pines put down a root to depths of more than 2 m (6 ft) in porous soils, but seldom more than 1 m (3 ft) in heavy clay soils. Exceptions occur in soils underlain by rock with deep fissures, where roots have been observed along cut banks at depths of 11 to 12 m (35 to 40 ft). In open stands, lateral roots may extend 46 m (150 ft). In dense stands, however, they are limited more to the crown width. The main mass of roots is concentrated within the top 60 cm (24 in) of the soil mantle. Reaction to Competition- In the Sierra Nevada mixed conifer type in California, growth of advance regeneration of ponderosa pine was compared to that of associates beneath various overstory stand densities (data on file at Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, Redding, CA). Even beneath a light overstory stand casting 47 percent shade, ponderosa pine saplings grew only about half as rapidly as their associates (Douglas-fir, sugar pine, white fir, and incense-cedar) and about half of that expected for fully lighted pines. Relative to associates elsewhere within its range, ponderosa pine is more shade tolerant than western larch but less tolerant than grand fir and western white pine (40). Overall, it is most accurately classed as intolerant of shade. Because of ponderosa pine's intolerance of shade, it tends to grow in even-aged stands and is usually managed by that method. Uneven-aged stands might appear common throughout the drier portion of its range but are in reality a mosaic of even-aged groups. Ponderosa pines lose vigor in dense stands. On drier sites in the Pacific Northwest, trees in pole-size stands with basal area stand densities above 34.4 m²/ha (150 ft²/acre) become subject to attack by bark beetles (54). Ponderosa pine remains physiologically young and responds to release up to age 200 in Arizona. Elsewhere, stagnated sapling stands 70 to 100 years old usually respond to thinning and seem to grow as rapidly as unstagnated trees, when crowns grow to sufficient size to take advantage of the additional growing space (3,7). Damaging Agents- Rabbits and hares injure or kill many seedlings, and pocket gophers are especially destructive. In areas where pocket gopher populations are high all seedlings and many saplings may be destroyed. Squirrels and porcupines attack sapling and pole-size trees and, although rarely killing them, deform the stems on which they feed. Repeated browsing by deer has stunted seedlings for 50 years or more (13,55). In the absence of regulation, sheep and cattle have damaged reproduction by trampling, bedding, and occasional browsing (13). At least 108 species of insects attack P. ponderosa var. ponderosa, and 59 species attack P. ponderosa var. scopulorum (13). The most damaging of the tree-killing insects are several species of Dendroctonus. Trees die from the combined effects of a blue stain fungus transmitted by the beetle and extensive larval consumption of the phloem. The western pine beetle (D. brevicomis) is a common cause of mortality in overmature, decadent trees within the range of ponderosa pine from Baja California, north into Oregon, Washington, western Canada, Idaho, and western Montana. During epidemics, however, apparently healthy, vigorous trees are also killed. During the drought years of the 1930's, losses from western pine beetle in the Pacific Northwest were so heavy that many foresters feared for the pine stands' continued existence. The mountain pine beetle (D. ponderosae) is the most destructive and aggressive enemy in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. During the 1894-1908 outbreak in the Black Hills of South Dakota, this insect killed between 5.7 and 11 million m³ (1 and 2 billion/fbm) of ponderosa pine (13). Tree killing by D. ponderosae has increased with the conversion of old-growth to young-growth stands in the Pacific Northwest. High stand density is believed to reduce vigor of some of the larger trees in a stand and, therefore, is an underlying factor in the occurrence of bark beetle outbreaks. D. adjunctus, D. approximatus, and D. valens are other species of the genus that often kill ponderosa pines. Among bark beetles, Ips species are second in destructiveness only to Dendroctonus (21). Ips are present naturally in all stands, where they usually breed in slash. In abundant slash from forestry activities, Ips can kill vigorous ponderosa pine up to 66 cm (26 in) in d.b.h. when populations reach explosive levels. Eleven species of Ips have been found attacking ponderosa pine. Of these, I. latidens, I. emarginatus, I. pini, I. lecontei, and I. paraconfusus have the most impact. Several insects mine buds and shoots, primarily of young trees. Although seldom killed, trees are retarded in growth when infestations are severe. Pine tip moths (Rhyacionia spp.) and the gouty pitch midge (Cecidomyia piniinopis) kill the buds and shoots they mine. A more insidious pest, until recently overlooked and overrated, is the western pineshoot borer (Eucosma sonomana) (21). Larvae of this species bore within the pith of the terminal shoot, stunting but seldom killing them. Shoots that are potentially more robust are more likely to be infested than are weaker shoots. Accordingly, direct comparisons of infested vs. uninfested shoot lengths will underestimate actual growth loss. Each terminal shoot infested by a larva that developed to maturity was reduced in length that year by more than 25 percent in one study (59). The pine reproduction weevil (Cylindrocopturus eatoni), a native of California and, presumably, Oregon, can be a threat to slow-growing plantations. Its impact has declined, however, with the improvement in planting stock and control of competing vegetation. Defoliating insects, such as the pine butterfly (Neophasia menapia) and the pandora moth (Coloradia pandora), periodically cause damage over extensive areas. The pine needle sheathminer (Zelleria haimbachi) can be locally severe in young stands. Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium vaginatum ssp. vaginatum in the Southwest, and A. campylopodium in California and the Northwest) is ponderosa pine's most widespread disease, absent only in the Black Hills (25). It seems to be particularly devastating in the Southwest, where it infects trees on about one-third of the commercial acreage. At Fort Valley Experimental Forest in northern Arizona, dwarf mistletoe has caused up to 36 percent of the mortality (55). On trees not killed, the parasite is responsible for a significant loss in growth, primarily in height, and is reported to reduce seed viability as much as 20 percent. In the Northwest, A. campylopodium has little effect on vigorous, young trees because height growth will usually exceed its upward spread, relegating the parasite to the lower crown (5). Several diseases attack ponderosa pine roots. Black stain root disease [Leptographium (syn. Verticicladiella) wageneri] causes a diffuse dark staining of the root wood and kills roots (6). Heterobasidion annosum causes an insidious lethal root disease that is spread by airborne spores to the surfaces of freshly-cut stumps. It and L. wageneri kill trees of all ages and usually result in group mortality that is sometimes mistaken for the work of bark beetles, which are frequently secondary invaders. Armillaria sp., previously considered weak root and butt decayers, are causing increased mortality in young plantations and thinned stands where the disease can build up in dead root systems (3). Active infection centers of L. wageneri and H. annosum spread about 1 m (3 ft) per year. The rate is usually less for Armillaria sp. The most damaging heart rot in the southern Rocky Mountains and the Black Hills is western red rot caused by Dichomitus squalens (25). It is a major cause of loss of sound wood in commercial stands. Because ponderosa pines older than 100 years have substantially greater defect, shorter rotation ages should eliminate much of the heart rot. Phellinus pini is the major heart rot in the Pacific Coast States. A needle cast, Elytroderma deformans, found throughout ponderosa pine's wide range, is the most serious foliage disease (6). It is unique among the needle casts in being perennial and in its capacity to infect the host twigs, which enables it to maintain its populations even under adverse environmental conditions. Although less destructive than the alarming appearance of affected trees suggests, it can slow growth and kill trees of sawtimber size. Bark beetles are prompt to attack infected trees. Severe damage from E. deformans was reported on the Ochoco National Forest in Oregon, where 555,900 m³ (98,148,000 fbm) of dying and dead trees were removed from 1946 to 1950 (13). Several rusts of the Cronartium coleosporioides complex are damaging to ponderosa pine. Locally, especially in the Southwest, limb rust (Peridermium filamentosum) attacks middle or upper crowns of mature trees, killing branches in both directions as it spreads (46). The western gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii) attacks ponderosa pine from the Black Hills to the Pacific Northwest (25). It infects all ages, resulting in round and pear-shaped galls, distortions, and trunk lesions. Young trees may be killed. Comandra blister rust (Cronartium comandrae) is found in all states west of the Rocky Mountains but is most common in California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. It causes scattered mortality in well-stocked sapling and small pole stands. In thinned stands, however, the disease may cause substantial damage (3). Air pollution is an increasing and vexing source of foliar damage to ponderosa pine. Ozone is the major plant-damaging constituent of photochemical oxidant air pollution. Ozone becomes concentrated enough to cause damage near the border of air basins and in the predominant summer downwind direction from heavily populated areas. Because ponderosa pine, especially var. ponderosa, is susceptible, and because it grows near areas heavily polluted, ozone damage can be great. Typical injury is a chlorotic mottling accompanied by premature abscission of old needles (6). Moderately or severely injured trees are attacked more frequently by bark beetles and Heterobasidion annosum root disease (28). Basal fire scars are common on the thick-barked stems in old-growth ponderosa pine forests. Uncontrolled fire was common before European colonization. These surface fires consumed branches, fallen trees, understory vegetation, and some living trees. The fires burned from 1 to 47 years apart, with most at 5- to 20-year intervals (3). Low-intensity fires kept many pine forests open and parklike. They also helped to maintain ponderosa pine in areas where more tolerant climax species would have attained dominance, because saplings or larger-sized ponderosa pine are more fire resistant than many of the true firs and Douglas-fir. Survival and growth of ponderosa pine usually are affected little if 50 percent or less of the crown is scorched in a fire. Six years after a fire in Arizona, however, no poles and only 5 percent of the sawtimber-size trees were living if more than 60 percent of the crown had been destroyed (13). Low tree vigor and cambium damage increase the likelihood of mortality. Vigorous young trees have survived, on occasion, when 100 percent of their crowns were scorched. Because buds are protected by thin long scales, late season fires cause less mortality. Continued accumulation of food reserves after diameter growth ceases in late summer also increases the ability of the tree to withstand fire injury. When crowns are scorched, young, fast-growing trees on good sites have the best chance of survival and old, slow-growing trees on poor sites the poorest chance. Snow often injures saplings and larger trees. Stem bending and breaking from unusually wet snowfalls that overload tree crowns can seriously damage dense pole-size stands (49). Stem deformation by snow pressure and movement on mountain slopes is a threat to sapling stands (38), especially where ponderosa pine is planted above its optimum elevational limit.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,14,1
"Ponderosa pine grows on soils derived from igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary parent materials, including quartzite, argillite, schist, shale, basalt, andesite, granite, cinders, pumice, limestone, and sandstone. This results in a variety of soil orders including Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, and Ultisols on which the species is found throughout its extensive range. Its distribution on drier sites is related closely to supplies of available soil moisture which, in turn, are related to soil textures and depth (13,20,22). In Wyoming, for instance, at the lower limits of coniferous forest, ponderosa pine is found only on coarse-textured soils of sandstone origin where the limited moisture is more readily available than on fine-textured soils of limestone origin (27). In Oregon and Washington, higher survival and growth rates of ponderosa pine have been reported for coarse-textured sandy soils than for fine-textured clayey soils (20). Ponderosa pine stands, 51, 75, and 78 years old, growing in coarse-, medium-, and fine-textured soils in Montana, had their greatest root development in the medium-textured soils and the least in the fine-textured soils. Root concentration was more uniform in the medium-textured soils and concentration dropped off abruptly below a soil depth of 46 cm (18 in) in the fine-textured soils (13). Depending on the locality and the horizon of the samples, soils vary from pH 4.9 to pH 9.1. The pH in the surface horizon frequently is from 6.0 to 7.0 (13). Foliar concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus needed for adequate growth are low in ponderosa pine compared with the associated conifers in California-Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens). Foliar concentrations of 0.9 percent for nitrogen and 0.08 percent for phosphorus mark critical boundaries between nutrient deficiency and sufficiency (42). Correcting nitrogen deficiency in California and central Oregon stands has increased volume growth 30 percent (50). Because critical levels of foliar nitrogen and phosphorus are lower in ponderosa pine, while early biomass gains generally are greater, this species is judged superior in satisfying its nutritional needs on soils that by other species' standards are infertile. Ponderosa pine is found at elevations from sea level to 3050 m (10,000 ft). From north to south the species grows at progressively higher altitudes and within more restricted elevational limits (1, 13,20,67). In Washington, the elevations for ponderosa pine are sea level to 1220 m (4,000 ft); in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon, 910 to 1520 m (3,000 to 5,000 ft); in the south-central Oregon pumice area, 1460 to 2010 m (4,800 to 6,600 ft); in the northern Rocky Mountains, from 300 to 1830 m (1,000 to 6,000 ft); in the middle Rockies up to 2590 m (8,500 ft); and in the southern Rockies, up to 3050 m (10,000 ft). In California, ponderosa pine is usually found at elevations from 150 to 1070 m (500 to 3,500 ft) in the north, and from 1610 to 2230 m (5,300 to 7,300 ft) in the south.",Soils and Topography,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,15,1
"In ponderosa pine forests, timber production, livestock grazing, and recreation are the principal land uses. Ponderosa pine forests are found at low elevations offering year-round recreation, and they frequently border forest highways where esthetic values are high. They provide habitats for various wildlife species. Abert's and Kaibab squirrels usually live in the ponderosa pine forests (55). Snags in the mature pine forest provide a large number of species with nesting and roosting sites. Big game, such as deer and elk, also use the pine forests for food and shelter.",Special Uses,Ponderosa Pine,pinus,ponderosa,conifer,16,1
"The two natural hybrids, P. x smithii and P. x jackii, are associated with the parental species in the same stand, and the parental species dominate in the stands. The majority of hybrid poplars are planted in pure stands and all competing vegetation is controlled the first few years after planting.

"In general, poplar hybrids grow best on humid and microthermal areas with adequate moisture during all seasons of the year. They are rarely found on sites that have temperatures of -46° C (-50° F) or on sites that have summer temperatures over 38° C (100° F) for more than a week.",Climate,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,2,0
"Approximately 30 species of poplars are available for hybridization as listed below; however, not all possible crosses have been successful or seem feasible at this time (fig. 2). -Summary of interspecific breeding in the genus Populus (7). An example of the genetics of one cultivar follows. One of the widely grown hybrid cottonwood cultivars is 'Robusta,' reportedly Populus angulata x P. plantierensis. Populus angulata is a clone of eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides var. deltoides); P. plantierensis is a hybrid of a western European black poplar (P. nigra) and Lombardy poplar (P. nigra var. italica). Lombardy poplar is a fastigate form of black poplar, native to Iran. Populusnigra var. betulifolia of western Europe is distinguished from the more easterly forms by the slightly hairy petioles and tips of young shoots. These are found in P. nigra var. plantierensis and transferred to the 'Robusta' clones. Good apical dominance, numerous side branches, and very narrow branch angle are traits inherited as a single dominant gene. Lombardy poplar is homozygous with respect to this gene, while P nigra var. plantierensis is heterozygous with respect to this gene (20).",Genetics,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,7,0
"Poplar hybrids occur naturally throughout the U.S. and Canada wherever compatible species come into close proximity (table 1). Most poplar hybrids, however, result from artificial hybridization and subsequent planting. The first large-scale hybridization project with poplars in the United States was begun in 1925 (41,42). An unknown number of hybrids also form between native species and introduced clones, cultivars, and species. The Jackii poplar is a natural hybrid between P.balsamifera females and P. deltoides males. Populus x Smithii is a natural hybrid between P. tremuloides and P. grandidentata. Hybridization between P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa occurs in the interior of southeastern Alaska and in the Cook Inlet region. Also, the trihybrid among P. deltoides, P. balsamifera, and P. angustifolia has been reported in southern Alberta.",Native Range,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Poplar hybrids are dioecious and first flower at about 8 years of age. The flowers are borne in catkins (or aments) in the spring before leafing. Male and female catkins, when fully developed, are 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) long. In the female flower, the number of stigmas varies from two to four and are either cap- or y-shaped. In the male flower, the number of stamens varies from 30 to 80. The bract has 20 to 30 digits, depending on the cultivar. The central areas of the bracts are light in color and the digits are dark brown, sometimes tinged with black (34). Many poplar hybrids have never produced flowers and thus are thought to be sterile. Poplars flower between February and May and disperse seed between April and June of the same year. Intersection Leuce hybrids disperse seed a few weeks before intersection Aigeiros and Tacamahaca or intersection Aigeiros-Tacamahaca hybrids. Fruits are one-celled capsules borne in long pendulous clusters (catkins), and each capsule is surrounded by tufts of long, white, silky hairs attached to the short stalks of the seeds, promoting wind dispersion over great distances (36). Seed Production and Dissemination- Poplar hybrids generally are prolific annual seed producers Individual trees of Populus tremula, an exotic, may yield from 8,000 to 54,000,000 seeds per year; hybrid poplar seed yields are thought to be the same. In Populus deltoides var. uirginiana 35 liters (1 bushel) of fresh fruit yields about 0.9 kg (2 lb) of seeds Populus seeds range in weight from 310,900 to 16,650,000 seeds/kg (141,000 to 7,550,000 seeds/lb) depending on the species, location, and tree (36). The seeds are disseminated some distance from the mother tree by the wind. Natural seed dispersal begins at the same time as seed dispersal of the associated pure species in the area. In northern New England, hybrids of inter- and intersectional crosses involving Aigeiros and Tacamahaca sections disperse seeds about June 1. Hybrids growing south of northern New England disperse seeds somewhat earlier. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Seedlings develop best on moist mineral soils where competing vegetation is minimal for 1 or 2 years after establishment. Seed germination capacity is retained only a few days under natural conditions. Seeds of Populus deltoides can be stored for at least 6 years at -20° C (-4° F) and 6 to 10 percent moisture without substantial loss in viability (43). Vegetative Reproduction- Poplar hybrids reproduce vegetatively by natural and artificial means. Leuce-type hybrids root best from root sections, though some selections root adequately from dormant stem cuttings. Aigeiros-type hybrids reproduce well from either greenwood or dormant stem cuttings, although most hybrids are reproduced from dormant cuttings. Dormant cuttings are produced predominately from hybrid stool beds established for that purpose. The cuttings are usually harvested in January to February, and stored in a cold chamber, or frozen as whips or cuttings, until planting. The whips or cuttings should not be allowed to desiccate. Cuttings should be soaked in water for at least 24 hours before planting. When hybrid poplars are planted in open fields or in areas with competing vegetation, good control of weeds, grasses, and vegetation is necessary for the poplars to survive. To establish poplar plantings by vegetative means the following steps should be taken: 1) plow or rototill the area during the summer before planting; 2) disk, cultivate, or rototill the area several times during the summer and fall so weeds grass, and vegetation will not gain a foothold; 3) disk: cultivate, or rototill in the spring before planting; 4) plant the poplars at the desired spacing; 5) cultivate frequently the first 2 years to eliminate competition. As early as 1945, it was established that hybrid poplars performed best in a sod- and weed-free field (37). More recent studies have shown cultivation to be advantageous (4,15,16,17,45). If step 5 is omitted, heavy sod and weed cover will reduce tree survival and growth. Weed control can be accomplished by use of chemicals, but these can be very injurious to hybrid poplars. Chemicals are not recommended unless great care is taken in their handling and use.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Poplars grow best on fertile soils, and early height growth can average 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) per year (7,8). Superior clones of poplar hybrids established with dormant cuttings spaced 1.2 by 1.2 m (4 by 4 ft) on two upland sites in Williamsburg, MA produced 2.5 to 15.3 in³ (1 to 6 cords) at 4 years, 7.6 to 35.7 m³ (3 to 14 cords) at 9 years, and 56.1 to 117.2 m³ (22 to 46 cords) at 15 years (38). Poplar hybrids growing on a reclaimed strip-mine site in Pennsylvania have maintained an average growth of 1.2 in (4 ft) per year and have reached 19.8 m (65 ft) in height growth after 16 growing seasons, producing an average of 12.6 m³/ha (2 cords/acre) per year (6). Early field tests of closely spaced Populus 'Tristis' hybrids at 4 years of age produced 11.2, 12.6, and 7.6 t/ha (5.0, 5.6, and 3.4 dry tons/acre) per year of stems and branches at spacings of 0.23 m (0.75 ft), 0.30 in (1 ft), and 0.61 m (2 ft), respectively (12). Rooting Habit-Aigeiros- type hybrids have strong horizontal surface roots from which plunging roots develop. Leuce-type hybrids develop plunging roots constituting 40 to 50 percent of their entire root system. In other poplar hybrids, horizontal roots have been measured at 15 m (50 ft) for a 10-year-old tree growing in sandy soil, 20 m (66 ft) for an old tree, and 18 in (60 ft) for an old Populus alba. The development of plunging roots is limited by the level of the water table or by the soil condition (1). Reaction to Competition- Poplars and poplar hybrids are very intolerant of shade in the forest community, especially in comparison with other more shade- and competition-tolerant species. Poplar hybrids are usually established in pure plantings, using dormant cuttings. With this method, hybrids cannot tolerate weed, grass, and shrub competition during the first 2 years after planting. Space around each tree is also needed during the growth of the stand. If branches of trees overlap, growth and vigor are reduced and recovery of growth rate is slow. Damaging Agents- In the Northeast, poplar hybrids are susceptible to many diseases and insects. Disease organisms that cause stem canker are hypoxylon canker (Hypoxylon mammatum) that infects aspens and their hybrids in low stocked stands; cytospera canker (Cytospera chrysosperma) that infects poplar hybrids and is promoted by moisture stress; dothichiza canker (Dothichiza populae) that causes decline in Lombardy poplar; septoria leaf spot (Septoria musiva) that causes severe stem infections in densely stocked stands; and pecan feeder root necrosis (Fusarium solani) that may develop in stems under 2 years old. Foliage diseases of varying severity are melampsora leaf rust (Melampsora medusae), marssonina leaf spot (Marssonina brunnea), oak leaf fungus (Septotinia podophyllina), shepherd's crook shoot blight (Venturia populina) on Tacamahaca poplars, V. macularis on Leuce and Aigeiros poplars), and a leaf spot (Phyllosticta spp.). The most serious defoliator of poplar hybrids, especially young trees, is the cottonwood leaf beetle (Crysomela scripta). The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the poplar tentmaker (Ichthyura inclusa), the spiny elm caterpillar or mourning cloak butterfly (Nymphalis antiopa), and the large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) can also cause complete defoliation. Leaf damage may also be inflicted by a leaf beetle (Zeugophora scutellaris), the aspen blotch miner (Phyllonorycter tremuloidiella), and the aspen leafminer (Phyllocnistis populiella). One of the most destructive poplar pests is the cottonwood twig borer (Gypsonoma haimbachiana). It kills buds and up to 25 cm (10 in) of shoot tips. Other borers that do damage are the poplar-and-willow-borer (Cryptorhynchus lapathi), the poplar borer (Saperda calcarata), the cottonwood borer (Plectrodera scalator), the bronze poplar borer (Agrilus liragus), and a flatheaded borer (A. horni). Infestations of the poplar gall midge (Prodiplosis morrisi) and various aphids and plant lice may reduce the growth of individual trees (9).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,14,0
"Poplar hybrids grow best where soils are at least 1 m (3.3 ft) in depth to interrupted bedrock. The water table and porous or gravel layers should also be at least 1 m (3.3 ft) below the soil surface. Optimum pH ranges from 6.0 to 7.0, though some hybrids tolerate high or low pH conditions. Hybrids grow well on upland and bottom-land soils if the soils have good moisture-holding capacities and are of medium texture. Hybrids show extreme variation in tolerance of adverse site conditions. They grow best on soils of the orders Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, and Ultisols.",Soils and Topography,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,15,0
"Hybrid poplars were initially developed for conventional pulpwood (42). In recent years, more interest has been placed on evaluation of hybrid poplar for short-rotation chip production for pulp and energy uses (4,21,27,28,29). However, at this time, investment rates of return are not attractive for large scale conversions to short rotation intensive culture systems (4,14). There are many estimates of poplar hybrid biomass yields in the literature, but the following values are averages from intensively managed plantations on many sites in the northeastern United States (9): First-year height growth is 0.9 to 2.4 rn (3 to 8 ft); mean annual height growth after 10 to 20 years is 0.9 to 1.4 m (3 to 4.5 ft); mean annual diameter growth after 10 to 20 years is 1.0 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in); mean annual volume increment after 10 to 20 years is 7.0 to 24.5 m³/ha (100 to 350 ft³/acre); and mean annual biomass increment after 5 to 20 years is 4.5 to 20.2 t/ha (2 to 9 tons/acre). Growth and yield vary appreciably depending on location, site quality, clone or cultivar used, and silvicultural conditions. These values given are only generally representative. Diameter growth of individual trees depends heavily on stocking density. Wide spacings or frequent thinnings promote rapid diameter growth. Biomass consists of ovendry, leafless stems and branches. Attainment of maximum mean annual increment occurs only if stands are heavily fertilized and irrigated and occurs much sooner at tree spacings of 2 m (6.6 ft) or less. In the northeastern United States, moose and deer often browse on poplar hybrids in recently planted plantations. Poplar buds are a choice food supply for ruffed grouse and several kinds of songbirds. Grouse and pheasant also eat the catkins. In urban areas, poplar hybrids are useful where fast-growing trees are needed for shade, landscaping, and screening around industrial buildings, apartment complexes, recreational playing areas, parking lots, and landfills. These trees live less than 100 years so more tolerant species should be interplanted with them. Poplar hybrids are used to stabilize soils on hillsides, along streams and rivers, landfills, and borrow pits. They are also planted as fence rows to reduce air speed in agricultural areas where soil is transported by the wind. Hybrid poplars have been extensively used as test organism for research studies because of their ease of propagation, fast growth, and the variety of clonal parentages. They have been used to study the effect of air pollutants (2,3,10,13,18,19,22,23,24,25,26, 30,31,32,33,46) and wood compartmentalization (11,39,40), to name just two.",Special Uses,Poplar Hybrids,populus,populus,hardwood,16,0
"Port-Orford-cedar is found with an extremely wide variety of associated plants and vegetation types. It usually grows in mixed stands and is important in the Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla, mixed evergreen, and Abies concolor vegetation zones of Oregon (3,13) and their counterparts in California (1). It also grows in a variety of minor communities from dry sand dunes to Darlingtonia (cobra-lily) bogs. The species reaches its greatest size and commercial worth in the dense, rapidly growing forests of the Picea sitchensis and the Tsuga heterophylla zones, in which Douglas-fir often dominates. Port-Orford-cedar is most dominant on wet soils, most of which have parent material at least partially ultramafic, in the high elevation Abies concolor zone where forests are dense but slow growing (13). In the mixed evergreen zone, it is the only shade-tolerant conifer in most stands. On drier sites on ultramafics and in bogs, forests can be very open and slow growing. The cedar is dominant in the forest cover type Port-Orford-Cedar (Society of American Foresters Type 231) (2) and is listed as a minor associate for parts of the following types: Sitka Spruce (Type 223), Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Redwood (Type 232), Oregon White Oak (Type 233), and Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234). Major communities in old-growth forests where Port-Orford-cedar is a major component include the following, named for the apparent dominants at climax (abbreviated names are given in parentheses) (13): Tsuga heterophylla zone- Tsuga heterophylla-Chamaecyparis lawsoniana/Polystichum munitum-Oxalis oregana (swordfern); Tsuga heterophylla-Chamaecyparis lawsoniana /Rhododendron macrophyllum-Gaultheria shallon (rhododendron); Chamaecyparis lawsoniana-Tsuga heterophylla/Xerophyllum tenax (bear grass). Mixed evergreen zone- Chamaecyparis lawsoniana/Lithocarpus densiflorus (tanoak); Pinus-Chamaecyparis lawsoniana/Quercus vaccinifolia/Xerophyllum tenax (mixed pine). Abies concolor zone- Abies concolor-Tsuga heterophylla-Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (white fir-western hemlock); Abies concolor-Chamaecyparis lawsoniana/herb (white fir); Abies-Chamaecyparis lawsoniana/herb (mixed fir). Port-Orford-cedar is less common in a wider variety of forest communities. Plants of major importance associated with Port-Orford-cedar vary among zones (6,13). Trees are Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), western white pine (P. monticola), redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), white fir (Abies concolor), and Shasta fir (A. magnifica var. shastensis). Shrubs are Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), western azalea (R. occidentale), evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum), red huckleberry (V. parvifolium), salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis), cascara buckthorn (Rhamnus purshiana), California buckthorn (R. californica), salal (Gaultheria shallon), Pacific bayberry (Myrica californica), huckleberry oak Quercus vaccinifolia), Sadler oak (Q. sadleriana), western leucothoe (Leucothoe davisiae), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), and Oregon boxwood (Pachistima myrsinites). Important herbs are swordfern (Polystichum munitum), Oregon oxalis (Oxalis oregana), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), western twinflower (Linnaea borealis var. longiflora), vanillaleaf (Achlys triphylla), prince's-pine (Chimaphila umbellata var. occidentalis), Hooker fairybells (Disporum hookeri), western starflower (Trientalis latifolia), and inside-out-flower (Vancouveria spp.). The general relationships of well-developed Port-Orford-cedar forests to rock type, geographic location, and elevation are shown in figure 1. These forests have 75- to 86-percent cover by trees more than 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h., except the mixed pine community, which has 39 percent. Tree reproduction is often abundant, and density of trees less than 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. ranges from 1246/ha (rhododendron community) to 4113/ha (white fir) (504 to 1,664/acre); 26 percent (swordfern) to 78 percent (tanoak) of these are Port-Orford-cedar; cover of tree reproduction ranges from 30 to 46 percent. Figure 1-Distribution of vegetation zones and eight major forest communities of old-growth Port-Orford-cedar, in relation to soil parent material, elevation, and geographic location. Zones are separated by solid lines, communities by broken lines (modified from 6). Shrub cover is very dense in rhododendron and tanoak communities (over 90 percent), moderate to dense in most communities (30 to 67 percent), but only 9 percent in the swordfern community. Moss cover is high in the Tsuga zone. Representation of Port- Orford-cedar is usually lower in the forest than in the cedar-dominated communities described above (13). For example, on 3752 ha (9,271 acres) of the former Port Orford Cedar Experimental Forest in southern Coos County, OR, 28 percent of total timber volume was Port-Orford-cedar. Cedar volume exceeded 50 percent on 41 percent of the area, was 25 to 50 percent on 7 percent of the area, 10 to 24 percent on 15 percent of the area, and less than 10 percent on the remainder.",Associated Forest Cover,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,1,1
"The Pacific Ocean strongly influences the climate of most of the range of Port-Orford-cedar. Winters are cool and wet; summers are warm and dry (13). Precipitation is moderate to high, usually 1000 to 2250 mm (39 to 89 in); only 2 to 4 percent occurs from June to August. A snowpack of 1 to 2 m (3 to 7 ft) is common at the higher elevations of the Klamath Mountains. Humidity remains high at night in most areas, although some interior valley sites have dry air during the day. Fog is common along the immediate coast and during the morning in some smaller interior valleys; summer cloudiness is most common near the northern end of the range. Temperatures varied widely in 2 years of measurement (13). At three coastal sites, monthly average understory air temperatures at 1 m (3 ft) ranged from 5° C (41° F) in January to 14° C (57° F) in July; the mean annual temperature was 8.5° C (47° F). At the warmest site at 360 m (1,180 ft) near Kerby, OR, monthly averages were 3° to 22° C (37° to 72° F) and annual average was 11.3° C (52° F); at the coldest site, southwest of Mount Shasta, CA, at 1520 m (4,980 ft), monthly averages were -2° to 14° C (29° to 57° F) and annual average was 5.2° C (41° F). The lowest air temperature measured in a Port-Orford-cedar stand was -15° C (5° F) at a height of 1 m (3 ft). Soil temperatures at 20 cm (8 in) below the surface were generally cool; the annual mean was 4° to 11° C (39° to 52° F). The average difference between the warmest and coldest month was 8° C (14° F). Apparently the soils seldom freeze; the minimum temperature measured was -0.5° C (31° F). Coastal winds in summer are primarily from north to northwest; they strike the coast at an angle at the north end of the range, driving moist air ashore and up the Coquille River Valley. This may influence the superb development of Port-Orford-cedar in this part of its range.",Climate,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,2,1

"Port-Orford-cedar grows in a small area near the Pacific coast, from about latitude 40° 50' to 43° 35' N. in southern Oregon and northern California (13). It is most important on uplifted marine terraces and in the Coast Ranges of southern Coos County and northern Curry County, OR. A secondary concentration is found at high elevations in the upper reaches of the Illinois and Klamath River drainages near the Oregon State boundary. Throughout the rest of its range, Port-Orford-cedar is found as small, scattered populations, most common in the drainages of the middle Rogue, upper Illinois, Smith, lower Klamath, and lower Trinity Rivers. A major inland disjunction includes small populations of the upper Trinity and Sacramento River drainages southwest of Mount Shasta, CA. - The native range of Port-Orford-cedar.",Native Range,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,11,1
"Port-Orford-cedar is extremely variable morphologically. Most horticultural cultivars originated as seedling mutations, produced by descendants of apparently only a few introductions to Great Britain (13). Some cultivars are notably more resistant to winter damage and spring frosts than are most, and some root more easily than others. There is obvious variation in growth rates among seedlings and rooted cuttings from various natural populations; northern coastal sources grow faster than those from inland, and those from productive, dense forest types grow faster than those from open forests on poor soils (13). Relative growth rates of different populations remain the same in culture on both good and poor soils. In culture, differences in nutrient content, and stomatal distribution occur among inland and coastal sources, and the foliar calcium-to-magnesium ratio is lower for a source from an ultramafic area than for those from other soils (13). Local variation occurs in stomatal resistance of seedlings to water loss, but it is not consistent regionally. Variability in adaptation of individual trees has been noted in Europe. Selections of desirable trees have been made in Great Britain. Apparently no provenance studies of growth have ever been made in field conditions (13). Trials of the species as an exotic may have suffered from the use of a limited seed source; the original introduction to Britain was from the upper Sacramento River, probably an area of slow growth. Allozyme variability differentiated two inland populations from seven coastal populations in California. The disjunct inland populations contained less variability than the coastal samples. Considerable variation among populations existed in both inland and coastal regions (10).",Population Differences,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pollen and seed cones develop on the same branches of this monoecious species. Reproductive organs are initiated in late spring or summer. They soon protrude beyond the surrounding leaves, and development continues through the summer. The bladderless pollen is formed in late winter in the bright red pollen cones; on the Oregon coast it is shed about mid-March. Fertilization occurs a month or more later, and seeds mature in September or October of the same season (5,13). Each fertile scale of the 7 to 10 scales in the globose cone usually bears 2 to 4 seeds. Cones contain about 20 percent of their weight in seeds (5). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production starts when the tree is 5 to 20 years old (5). It can be induced in trees as young as 7 months with sprays of 50 p/m gibberellic acid (the effect is enhanced by Ethrel) with the correct photoperiodic regime (13). (At least 2 weeks of long days are required after gibberellin treatment, followed by at least 2 weeks of short days, followed by long days to allow cone maturation.) The major peak of seedfall is in the late fall, with a smaller one in spring. Roughly 50 to 60 percent of the seeds fall by mid-January and 85 to 90 percent by May 1 (13); however, some seed is released all year. Crops of 20,000 to 4,600,000 seeds per hectare (8,094 to 1,862,000/acre) have been measured, with a mean of 829,000 seeds per hectare (335,000/acre) for 30 crops (13). Annual seed production can also be expressed in relation to a unit basal area of the population; 600 to 185,000 with a mean of 40,200 seeds per square meter (56 to 17,187 with a mean of 3,735/ft²) of basal area were produced. Of 30 crops, 5 exceeded 100,000 seeds per square meter (9,290/ft²) of basal area, 6 produced 20,000 to 60,000 seeds per square meter (1,858 to 5,574/ft²), 6 had 10,000 to 20,000 seeds per square meter (929 to 1,858/ft²) , and 13, less than 10,000 seeds per square meter (929/ft²). High seed production per unit basal area occurred in all types of habitats sampled and in both 65-year-old and old-growth forests. No site had good or moderate seed crops 2 years in succession. There seems to be no regional synchronization of large seed crops, however, as occurs in many tree species. The seeds are small, averaging about 463 000/kg (210,000/lb), with a range of 176 to 1323/g (80,000 to 600,000/lb) (5). Despite having small wings along both sides, the seeds apparently fall more rapidly than many larger conifer seeds. The seed wings appear to aid their flotation on water. Seeds are not a preferred food of rodents in feeding experiments (7), but harvesting of large numbers of cones and removal of seed from them by rodents have been observed in natural stands (13). Seeds may be stored frozen at less than 10 percent moisture in a sealed container for more than 10 years and retain considerable viability (5,12). One study reports 43 percent germination from seed stored this way for 13 years. Few seeds, if any, germinate later than the first year after dispersal (13). Seedling Development- Seed germination is epigeal; in the natural habitat, it occurred in early June or later in the 1 year it was observed (13). Germination ranged from 11 to 44 percent in natural seed fall trapped on the floor of seven forests. Germination of collected seed is often higher, about 50 percent (5). Stratification increases germination and seedling growth for some seed lots (13). Red light accelerates germination; far-red light delays it. In laboratory conditions, few seeds germinate below 12° C (12). Sowing in the nursery in March and April is more reliable in England than fall sowing (13). In nursery practice, seeds were sown at 320 to 540/m² (30 to 50/ft² ) and covered by 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.25 in) of soil (5). Shading until midseason may be helpful. A nursery yield of 284,000 usable plants per kilogram of seed (129,000/lb) has been reported (5). Port-Orford-cedar seedlings are easy to grow and establish (13). Seedlings have been planted as 2-0 or 3-0 stock in the United States, and after the first or second year, or as 2-1 stock in Great Britain. Spacing in Britain is 1.4 to 1.5 m (4.5 to 5 ft); recently, in its native range, Port-Orford-cedar has been interplanted with Douglas-fir, at 2.7- to 8-m (9- to 26-ft) spacing (13). Seedlings are small, with two cotyledons. The next several whorls of leaves are needlelike (5 to 13 whorls in one study); successive whorls gradually develop into the mature, appressed, scalelike foliage differentiated into the flat ""facial"" and the folded ""lateral"" leaves (13). Seedling establishment in small experimental plots under a natural canopy was most common where soil had been disturbed but did occur in natural litter; after three growing seasons, only 5 percent of the germinants survived in the most favorable soil conditions. In clearcut or partially cut areas, establishment decreases as ground cover vegetation increases (7). Seedling growth under a canopy is slow-experimental seedlings are only about 40 mm (1.6 in) tall after their second growing season (13). Seedlings in the open average 36 mm (1.4 in) after 1 year and 78 mm (3.1 in) after 2. Planted 3-0 stock averaged 48 cm (18.8 in) tall after 2 years in the field (7). Natural seedlings established under a canopy take 14 to 31 years to reach breast height (1.37 m; 4.5 ft), compared with 5 to 11 years for trees in clearcuts on nonultramafic soils (13). Early seedling growth sometimes equals that of Douglas-fir in the same clearcut. Seedlings are quite shade-tolerant but do die in dense shade under old-growth forest and do not become established under young, dense, even-aged stands (13). They seem to survive in most understory microsites where western hemlock and white fir can grow. Port-Orford-cedar often reproduces aggressively from seed. Natural reproduction in clearcuts is usually adequate within 80 to 110 m (262 to 361 ft) of a seed source; however, planting will often be required in large clearcuts (13). Planted seedlings may grow normally in dense competition from gorse or bracken fem. Later growth is intrinsically somewhat slower than that of Douglas-fir (13), and weeding may be necessary to keep Port-Orford-cedar in the upper canopy where maximum growth is possible. Port-Orford-cedar does not develop winter buds with preformed internodes (13). Elongation continues for as long as 5 months in mild coastal climates; it is more rapid and early in the mixed evergreen zone and equally rapid but late in the Abies concolor zone. Elongation lasts 1.3 to 1.9 times as long as that of Pinaceae on the same site. Vegetative Reproduction- Cuttings may be rooted with relative ease (13). A recommended practice is to use cuttings from tips of major branches from the lower crown of young trees, taken from December to February. Auxin treatments sometimes aid rooting. Natural layering of Port-Orford-cedar occurs occasionally (13). Several vertical limbs of windthrown trees in open stands may develop into separate trunks attached to the horizontal ""parent"" trunk. Most reproduction, however, is from seed.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- After the sapling stage, growth of Port-Orford-cedar is considerably slower than that of Douglas-fir, except on ultramafic substrates where the cedar is usually exceeded in size only by sugar pine (13). In 8- to 26-year-old plantations in the Pacific Northwest, annual height growth of unbrowsed Port-Orford-cedar averaged 0.35 m (1.15 ft), only 86 percent of the mean annual height growth of Douglas-fir; the difference was much greater for browsed trees. In mixed stands, Port-Orford-cedar is usually overtopped by 20 to 25 years. Pole-size stands in the northern part of the range show a large difference in both diameter and height between Douglas-fir and cedar. In one small sample of 53- to 60-year-old trees (age determined at breast height) in coastal Coos County, OR, the Douglas-fir averaged 73 cm (29 in) in d.b.h. and 38 m (125 ft) in height; the cedar averaged 47 cm (19 in) and 28 m (92 ft). Measurements of adjacent stumps on several sites throughout the range showed that the diameter of Port-Orford-cedar was 57 percent that of Douglas-fir at 100 years; however, the difference decreased with age, cedar becoming 74 percent of the diameter of Douglas-fir at 200 years, 78 percent at 300, and 90 percent at 400 (13). Diameter growth of cedar is thus more consistent throughout its life than is that of Douglas-fir. Size of old-growth cedar trees is variable; much variation is associated with the habitat (and thus the forest community) (13). Early rapid height growth in open stands on ultramafic rocks is not sustained. For example, a sample of forest-grown 90- to 110-year-old trees averaged 30 m (98 ft) in height in the swordfern community, 18 m (59 ft) in the mixed pine community on ultramafics, and 12 to 13 m (39 to 43 ft) in other communities. By 190 to 210 years, heights were 47 m (154 ft) for swordfern, 25 to 29 m (82 to 95 ft) for other communities, but only 21 m (69 ft) for the mixed pine community. At 290 to 310 years, values were 63, 31 to 50, and 29 m, respectively (207, 102 to 164, and 95 ft). Average diameters in old-growth stands range from 42 cm (17 in) (diameter of a tree of mean basal area, mixed pine community) to 86 cm (34 in) (swordfern). Trees more than 100 cm (39 in) in d.b.h. occur in many old-growth stands, and trees of 200 to 250 years may reach 100 cm, but most trees this size are older than 300. On the other hand, one 37-cm (15-in) tree in the mixed pine community was more than 300 years old. Maximum tree age exceeds 560 years (13). Relatively few yield values exist for young stands. Experience in Great Britain is limited but well documented (13); Port-Orford- cedar is combined with western redcedar in yield tables (table 1). Thinnings begin at 20 to 30 years. Mean annual increment (MAI) peaks at 57 to 72 years. Current annual increment (CAI) increases later than for Douglas-fir and western hemlock on good sites and after its peak decreases more slowly than Douglas-fir but faster than hemlock. On poor sites, CAI starts to increase late than for Douglas-fir but earlier than for hemlock; it decreases after Douglas-fir but before hemlock. On good sites, peak MAI is reached 5 years later than for Douglas-fir and hemlock; on poor sites, it is reached 10 years later than for Douglas-fir but 5 years earlier than for hemlock. In one study, cedar plantations at 60 years were maintained at two to three times the density of Douglas-fir with 1.4 to 1.5 times higher basal area. Sixty-year-old trees averaged 5 to 8 m (16 to 25 ft) shorter and 11 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) smaller in diameter breast height than Douglas-fir. Volumes reported from young natural stands in Oregon (table 2) and plantations in Europe and New Zealand (13) are in the moderate to low range, compared with British plantations; however, the small top diameter limit used for table 1 and the impurity of natural stands may account for most or all of the difference. Values of MAI for two Oregon stands (table 2) were 13.7 (61 years) and 16.9 m³/ha (57 years) (196 and 242 ft³/acre). Live volumes of Port-Orford-cedar in old-growth forest sampled in 1935-40 averaged 86 m³/ha (1,229 ft³/acre) in the valley of the South Fork of the Co- quille River (Port Orford Cedar Experimental Forest, 3752 ha or 9,271 acres); the most volume in a 259-ha (640-acre) section was 154 m³/ha (2,201 ft³/acre) (13). Average volume near Bluff Creek, southwest of Orleans, CA, in 1940 was 22 m³/ha (314 W/acre) and the maximum was 47 m³/ha (672 ft³ /acre) on 4922 hectares (12,162 acres). Most volume was in large trees. On coastal terraces, the proportion of Port-Orford-cedar decreased as total volume of old-growth timber increased (13). Rooting Habit- A dense, coastal 50-year-old stand of Port-Orford-cedar on a clay-loam soil had a dense network of fibrous roots at the surface (4). The major horizontal system of surface roots extended up to 7 m (22 ft) from the trunk, producing ""humus strivers"" (roots with unlignified tips that rise into the surface soil and duff) uniformly along its length. Root systems of adjacent trees intermingled freely; some overlap was likely in trees closer than 12 m (39 ft). Root grafting was common in the main horizontal surface root system, averaging 1.5 grafts per tree; the average graft was 34 cm (13 in) deep between roots 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in diameter. The chance of grafting decreased with both horizontal distance between trees (becoming very small beyond 6 m (20 ft)) and with vertical distance on the slope; however, graft complexes that included several trees sometimes joined trees as far as 12 m (39 ft) apart. Port-Orford-cedar has no taproot but produces vertical sinkers from the horizontal system. Port- Orford-cedar forms endomycorrhizae with fungi of the family Endogonaceae (13). Reaction to Competition- Port-Orford-cedar is tolerant of shade and of competition in natural stands (13). Its slow growth beyond the sapling stage results in its being overtopped, but it continues to grow and retains into old age the ability to respond after the dominants die (7). Port-Orford-cedar can reproduce effectively from seed after clearcutting and partial cutting (where a sufficient seed source is present) and under almost all natural forests, and it can be used for under-planting established forest or scrub (13). Some old-growth forest structures resulted from repeated waves of invasion, almost certainly after fires. Because of its shade tolerance, relatively thick bark, high value, and moderate but consistent growth rate, Port-Orford-cedar might be grown effectively in a partial-cut system in which faster growing associates are removed part way through the rotation. Its litter (with high calcium and high pH) increases soil pH, suggesting that the species may be important in afforestation of moderately acidic soils or for ameliorating the effects of other conifers on soils (13). Shade tolerance and a narrow crown allow dense stocking in British plantations, and volume for a given height is high (13). Holes left after thinning close slowly, however, and a longer thinning cycle is necessary than for most conifers. Pruning is not useful. Forking of trees has been a problem in many British plantations. In recent years, plantations of Port-Orford-cedar have not been widely established in the Pacific Northwest outside its native range because of problems with root rot, winter damage, and its slow growth relative to other species (13). Damaging Agents- The major causes of damage to Port-Orford-cedar are fungi of the genus Phytophthora (11,13). An exotic root rot caused by P. lateralis was introduced into Coos County about 1952 and has decimated many stands in the area where Port-Orford-cedar grows best. Neither resistance to the rot nor effective treatment of it has been identified. Spores of the fungus are carried by water, so one introduction of the disease may spread to all stands in the watershed below. Natural uphill spread is slow. Infections are carried uphill rapidly or between watersheds in mud on equipment or livestock; they have reached northern Del Norte County, CA. Many isolated stands or those uphill from infection centers, however, may be kept free of the disease by careful exclusion of contaminated machinery, livestock, and nursery stock. Phytophthora cinnamomi causes major losses to some nurseries and cultivated trees. A white pocket top rot, caused by an unidentified fungus, is a serious problem. Losses to other diseases and to insects are minor (13). Animal damage to planted seedlings is highly variable, sometimes more and sometimes less than on associated conifers (13). Drought damages native trees on the hotter sites and in inland areas without seepage (13). Port-Orford-cedar is more affected than its associates on these sites. Laboratory experiments show that it is also more susceptible to freezing than most associated trees, although reports of winter damage in the field vary (13). In some instances, no damage occurred at -25° C (-13° F); others report severe damage at -13° C (9° F). Most drastic winter kill occurred in dry, windy, cold weather, desiccation apparently being of considerable consequence. Susceptibility to spring frosts in Great Britain is lower for Port-Orford-cedar than for most of its usual associates. Damage by wind, ice, and snow occurs, but the species does not seem especially susceptible (13). Port-Orford-cedar effectively recovers from loss of its leader or from extensive killing of foliage at the crown surface. If twigs are killed deeply enough into the crown, however, a tree apparently does not recover because it does not resprout from the ""old wood"" (13). Port-Orford-cedar resists moderate air pollution but does poorly where pollution is intense (13). It is more sensitive to nitrous oxide than nitric oxide. Levels of sulfur dioxide that reduce photosynthesis of Port-Orford-cedar have little effect on Douglas-fir and western redcedar. Although young trees are easily killed by fire, older trees develop thick bark and survive large, deep fire scars (13). In old stands, Port-Orford-cedar seems as tolerant of fire as Douglas-fir.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,14,1
"Port-Orford-cedar grows on many geologic and soil types: sand dunes; bogs, margins of intermittent streams, and drier sites on ultramafic rocks; and productive soils on sedimentary rocks and diorite (13). The largest trees are found on deep soils weathered from sedimentary rocks in Coos County, OR. The species is also found on sedimentary rocks near the lower Klamath River in California. Throughout much of its range, it is restricted to areas with consistent seepage within a meter of the soil surface. South of Coos County, OR, it is most common on wet spots on ultramafic rocks, especially at lower elevations in the inland and southern parts of its range. Reportedly, Port-Orford-cedar grows on soils in the orders Spodosols, Ultisols, and Inceptisols. Soils vary from well developed, deep, and productive to skeletal (in seepage areas on peridotite) (13). Average depth to the surface of the C horizon ranges from 32 cm (13 in) in the mixed pine community to 73 cm (29 in) in the rhododendron community. Surface soils vary from sandy loam to clay in texture and often contain much gravel, cobble, or stone; their pH values range from 4.2 to 7.0; cation exchange capacities range from 10 to 42 meq/100 g. Concentrations of macronutrients are nitrogen, 0.12 to 0.25 percent; phosphorus, 2 to 40 p/m; extractable potassium, 36 to 400 p/m; extractable calcium, 0.3 to 10.8 meq/100 g; extractable magnesium, 0.2 to 9.9 meq/100 g. Calcium-to-magnesium ratios are 0.2 to 3.7. Foliar concentrations of nutrients in native saplings are often low (means for 85 saplings at 10 sites were 0.86 percent nitrogen, 0.52 percent potassium, and 0.11 percent phosphorus); in contrast, calcium is usually quite high (1.11 percent) (13). The calcium-to-magnesium ratio of foliage is high, averaging 4.4 and staying above 2 even on ultramafic substrates. Surface soils under Port-Orford-cedar plantations in Great Britain have the highest pH of soils under any conifer tested. Growth in the northern end of the natural range increases with levels of nitrate in the soil. In culture, growth increases with levels of potassium, nitrogen, and calcium in the foliage (13). In some areas in the northern part of its range, Port-Orford-cedar grows in habitats similar to those of western redcedar (8,9). On sites where both species are present, soils under Port-Orford-cedar are usually more acidic and have higher concentrations of potassium and lower calcium: magnesium ratios. Mineralization of nitrogen is slower in Port-Orford-cedar litter. Port-Orford-cedar usually grows on concave or sheltered slopes where soil seepage occurs (13). It is most common on slopes, on benches, and in drainageways. Restriction to streamsides and ravines is most obvious inland at low elevations. Stands are most common on northwest, north, and northeast aspects, especially at lower elevations. Port-Orford-cedar grows from just above sea level to about 1500 m (4,900 ft) in the main section of the range, and to 1950 m (6,400 ft) near Mount Shasta (13).",Soils and Topography,Port-Orford-Cedar,chamaecyparis,lawsoniana,conifer,15,1
"Outside its natural range, the major use of Port-Orford-cedar is as an ornamental (13). As such, it is usually referred to as Lawson cypress. More than 200 cultivars are known, varying in size, shape, foliar morphology, and color. It is suitable for hedges but is usually planted as separate individuals of either full-sized or dwarfed varieties. Its use has declined in some areas because of root rot.

"In the Northern Forest Region, post oak is found in the forest cover type White Pine-Chestnut Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 51) (4). On dry ridges and upper slopes its other associates are scarlet, white, and black oaks (Quercus coccinea, Q. alba, and Q. uelutina), hickories (Carya spp.), and pines (Pinus spp.). In the Central Forest Region, post oak is most abundant in Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40). It extends over a wide area from eastern Kansas south to Texas and east to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. On heavier, clay soils a post oak variant of this type is found, and in the Texas ""Cross Timbers"" area and in Oklahoma, a post oak savanna. Along with other oaks, post oak is a common associate in several other cover types: Bear Oak (Type 43), Chestnut Oak (Type 44), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), White Oak (Type 53), Black Oak (Type 110), Pitch Pine (Type 45), and Eastern Redcedar (Type 46). In the Southern Forest Region, sand post oak is a chief hardwood component of Sand Pine (Type 69). Sand post oak and post oak grow on drier sites of Longleaf Pine (Type 70) and in Southern Scrub Oak (Type 72). Post oak is a common associate in Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Type 83), Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Virginia Pine (Type 79), Loblolly Pine (Type 81), and Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80), and on better drained sites of Slash Pine (Type 84). In the oak-pine types post oak is a common associate in Shortleaf Pine-Oak (Type 76), Virginia Pine-Oak (Type 78), and the Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82); sand oak is an important component of Longleaf Pine-Scrub Oak (Type 71). Delta post oak is found in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91). In Mesquite (Type 68) of east central Texas, post oak appears in mixture with mesquite (Prosopis spp.). The most common hardwoods associated with typical post oak are blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black oak, and the hickories. Less common associates include southern red oak (Q. falcata), white oak, scarlet oak, chestnut oak (Q.prinus), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), live oak (Q. uirginiana), chinkapin oak (Q. muehlenbergii), bluejack oak (Q. incana), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), red maple (Acer rubrum), winged elm (Ulmus alata), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), chinkapin (Castanea spp.), and dogwood (Cornus spp.). Coniferous associates are eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), Virginia pine (P. virginiana), pitch pine (P. rigida), loblolly pine (P. taeda), and occasionally longleaf and slash pines (P. palustris and P elliottii). At higher elevations eastern white pine (P.strobus) and hemlock (Tsuga spp.) are sometimes associates. Delta post oak is commonly associated with cherrybark oak (Quercus falcata var. pagodifolia), water oak (Q. nigra), willow oak (Q. phellos), swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii), white oak, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum, American elm (Ulmus americana), winged elm, white ash (Fraxinus americana), hickories, and loblolly pine. In the South, where post oak is a major component in many stands, the following small trees are common associates: shining sumac (Rhus copallina), smooth sumac (R. glabra), gum bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa), hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), possumhaw (J.decidua), redbud (Cercis canadensis), and rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum).",Associated Forest Cover,Post Oak,quercus,stellata,hardwood,1,0
"The range of post oak reaches from the humid East to semiarid portions of Oklahoma and Texas. Within this region, average annual precipitation varies from more than 1520 mm (60 in) in west Florida and parts of Louisiana to less than 560 mm (22 in) in central Texas. Annual snowfall varies from 760 cm (30 in) in southeastern Iowa to a trace in Florida (15). Mean annual temperatures vary from 10' C (50' F) in southern New England and southeastern Iowa to 22' C (72' F) in central Florida. January temperatures average from -6' C (22' F) in southeastern Iowa to 17' C (62' F) in Florida; in July they range from 23' C (73' F) in southern New England to 290 C (85' F) in Texas. Temperature extremes of -11' C (12' F) in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas and -400 C (-40' F) in central Missouri have been recorded.

The great variation in post oak and its tendency to hybridize creates a number of varieties and hybrids. The following hybrids with Quercus stellata have been recognized (10): Q. alba (Q. x fernowii Ti-el.); Q. bicolor (Q. x substellata Trel.); Q. durandii (Q. x macnabiana Sudw.); Q. havardii (unnamed); Q. lyrata (Q. x sterrettii Trel.); Q. macrocarpa (Q. x guadalupensis Sarg.); Q. minima (Q. x neo-tharpii A.

"The range of post oak extends from southeastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, southern Connecticut and extreme southeastern New York (including Long Island); west to southeastern Pennsylvania and West Virginia, central Ohio, southern Indiana, central Illinois, southeastern Iowa and Missouri; south to eastern Kansas, western Oklahoma, northwestern and central Texas; and east to central Florida (10). It is a large and abundant tree in the southern Coastal Plain, the Piedmont, and the lower slopes of the Appalachians. It is common in the southwest and grows in pure stands in the prairie transition region of central Oklahoma and Texas known as the ""Cross Timbers"" (2). Sand post oak (Quercus stellata var. margaretta (Ashe) Sarg.) ranges from southeastern Virginia, west to Missouri and eastern Oklahoma, south to central Texas, and east to central Florida. Delta post oak (Q. stellata var. paludosa Sarg.) is found in bottom lands of the Mississippi River in western Mississippi, southeast Arkansas, and Louisiana, and west to east Texas (10). -The native range of post oak.",Native Range,Post Oak,quercus,stellata,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Post oak is monoecious; staminate and pistillate flowers are on the same tree in separate catkins (aments). Flowers appear at the same time as the leaves. Flowering usually begins in March in the South and extends through May further north. Staminate flowers are borne in pendant catkins 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long. The calyx is yellow, pubescent, and five-lobed; the lobes are acute and laciniately segmented, with four to six stamens and pubescent anthers. Pistillate catkins are short-stalked or sessile and inconspicuous; the scales of the involucre are broadly ovate and hairy with red, short, enlarged stigmas (18). The acorns mature in one growing season and drop soon after ripening, from September through November. Late freezes after the start of flowering and leafing may cause seed crop failures. The acorns are sessile or short-stalked, borne solitary, in pairs, or clustered; acorns are oval or ovoid-oblong, broad at the base, 13 to 19 mm (0.5 to 0.75 in) long, striate, set in a cup one-third to one-half its length. The cup is bowl-shaped, pale, and often pubescent within. Externally it is hoary-tomentose. The scales of the cup are reddish brown, rounded or acute at the apex, and closely appressed (18). Seed Production and Dissemination- In common with many other oaks, post oak begins to bear acorns when it is about 25 years old. Good acorn crops are produced at 2- to 3-year intervals; although at several locations in Missouri over a 6-year period, post oak consistently averaged only 200 seeds per tree per year while white, blackjack, black, and scarlet oaks of the same size on the same site bore from 500 to 2,400 acorns per tree. Isolated trees in open fields in east Texas consistently produced well. Elsewhere in Texas, trees less than 15 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. had no acorns (12). The number of post oak acorns per kilogram averages 838 (380/lb) but may range from 441 to 1,340 (200 to 608/lb) (17). In a sampling of post oak acorn yields from 736 trees for 18 years (1950-67) in western Louisiana and eastern Texas, the average number of fresh acorns per kilogram was 476 (216/lb) with 39 percent moisture content (5). Mast yield increased linearly with increasing bole size. Expected acorn yield was 1.6 kg (3.6 lb) from trees 30.5 cm (12 in) in d.b.h., and 3.6 kg (8.0 lb) from trees 50.8 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. The percentage of acorn-producing trees also increased with increasing d.b.h. from 42 percent on 15.2 cm (6 in) trees to 76 percent on 55.9 cm (22 in) trees. Expected acorn yield rose from 0.9 kg (2 lb) on trees with a 3.0 ni (10 ft) crown diameter to 5.5 kg (12.1 lb) on trees with a 6.1 m (20 ft) crown diameter. Average acorn yield per tree over the 18-year observation period varied from a low 0.03 kg (0.07 lb) in 1962 to a high 4.4 kg (9.7 lb) in 1965. Seedling Development- Post oak acorns germinate in the autumn soon after dropping. They do not exhibit dormancy. Germination is hypogeal. The best seedbed is a moist soil covered with 2.5 cm (I in) or more of leaf litter. Vegetative Reproduction- Post oaks up to 25 cm (10 in) in d.b.h. sprout prolifically after being cut or burned. Along the southwestern margins of its range, post oak spreads rapidly into former grasslands after periodic prairie fires were stopped, and much of this extension appears to be of sprout origin. In one study in which potted seedlings were deprived of moisture until the aboveground parts died, two to three times as many post oaks sprouted after normal moisture was restored than did white, blackjack, northern red, or scarlet oaks (12). In a comparison of the sprouting habits of five oaks, post oak had more one-stem clumps and fewer sprouts per clump on the average than did black oak, chestnut oak, white oak, or scarlet oak. This characteristic would be important in culture by coppice except that post oak grows more slowly than the others.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Post Oak,quercus,stellata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- In the Southeast, mature post oaks are from 15.2 to 18.3 m (50 to 60 ft) tall and from 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h. Maximum height rarely exceeds 30 m (100 ft), and diameters exceeding 122 cm (48 in) are uncommon. In the extreme western part of its range, mature trees are seldom larger than 9 to 12 in (30 to 40 ft) tall and 38 to 46 cm (15 to 18 in) in d.b.h. Height and diameter growth for post oak are usually slower than for any of the associated trees except blackjack oak ' Ten-year diameter growth generally averages less than 5 cm (2 in), and in central Oklahoma it may be only 13 mm (0.5 in). Diameter growth of individual post oaks averaging 17 cm (6.7 in) in d.b.h. was stimulated when most of the stand was removed to favor forage production in Robertson County, TX (12). Post oak stands were thinned from an average of 14.9 m²/ha (65 ft² /acre) basal area to 8.9, 6.0, and 3.0 m²/ha (39, 26, and 13 ft² /acre). In the two ensuing growing seasons, average annual diameter growth for the heaviest thinning was twice that of the uncut check plots (3.6 mm. compared to 1.8 mm, excluding bark, or 0.14 in compared to 0.07 in). Average post oak stands in east Texas contain a volume of about 47.2 m³/ha (7.5 cords or 675 ft³/acre). In an Oklahoma woodland, typical of the dry upland post oak type, post oaks 30 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. and larger made up 64 percent of the sawtimber volume (Doyle rule) in a stand averaging nearly 28.0 m³/ha (2,000 fbm/acre). The average post oak contained 0.4 m' (70 fbm). Rooting Habit- Post oak seedlings have especially thick taproots, usually exceeding the shoot diameter; but overall root development is less than that of northern red (Quercus rubra), scarlet, white, and blackjack oak (12). Although post oak seedlings do become established on sites having a tight clay subsoil, their growth is slow and most roots develop above the underlying clay (3). Post oak seedlings were found to be the most drought resistant of four Missouri oaks, primarily because of the greater drought tolerance of their leaf and root cells (13). In Alabama, post oak was the least tolerant of flooding of all species tested (6). Reaction to Competition- Post oak is intolerant of competition and is classed as intolerant of shade. Because of its slow height growth it often is overtopped by other trees, including most other oaks. On poor sites, however, post oak tends to persist and become dominant because it is more drought resistant than many of its associates (12). Damaging Agents- Post oak is susceptible to most insects, diseases, and pollutants that present a threat to other oaks. Regeneration efforts are hampered by acorns being destroyed by weevils. Insect defoliators, leafrollers, tent caterpillars, Gypsy moth, sawfly, leaf miners, and skeletonizers may cause growth losses, and when repeated, may cause mortality (14). The foliage also is susceptible to at tacks by aphids, lace bugs, various scales, gall wasps, and mites. The trunk, twigs, and roots may be damaged by carpenterworms, borers, beetles, twig pruners, white grubs, and cicadas (locusts). Some of these cause defects that render the wood unfit for many commercial purposes (1). Chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) causes many defects as well as mortality to post oak throughout its range (8). The tree also is subject to oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum), a vascular disease prevalent mostly north of the 35th parallel, but not to the same degree as on red oaks. Soil-inhabiting fungi may cause heavy seedling mortality by damping off. Powdery mildews stunt and deform nursery seedlings. Many fungi produce spots, blotches, blisters, and blights on the foliage. They rarely cause real damage but are unsightly. Decay fungi cause cankers, rots, and discoloration of the upper and lower stem, as well as of the roots. The Texas root rot (Phymatotrichum ormnivorum) attacks mainly oaks planted on old farm fields or in subdivisions (14). Several species of mistletoe are often found on branches and trunks of post oak. Infected branches may be stunted and eventually die. Trees usually are not killed. Nonpoint source pollutants near large cities cause twigs of many oaks to die back, or kill the trees. The specific diagnosis is usually difficult. Sulfur dioxide, fluoride, ammonia, and some herbicides have been identified as probable agents.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Post Oak,quercus,stellata,hardwood,14,0
"Post oak grows on a variety of sites and soils. Its range coincides mostly with that of the Utisols but also includes some Alfisols in the western portion of its distribution. Typically, it grows on dry sites. Rocky outcrops, ridges, and upper slopes with southerly or westerly exposures are common. Soils are generally well drained, sandy, coarse textured, deficient in nutrients, and low in organic matter. The surface soil is generally thin but post oak, and especially the scrubby sand post oak, grows on deep sandy, gravelly soils. Delta post oak grows in fine sandy loam soils on the highest first-bottom ridges in terraces. There is seldom standing water, but the site may be wet due to slow drainage.",Soils and Topography,Post Oak,quercus,stellata,hardwood,15,0
"Post oak is a valuable contributor to wildlife food and cover. Acorns provide high energy food during fall and winter and are considered important in the diet of wild turkey, white-tailed deer, squirrels, and many other rodents. When acorns are available animals fatten quickly, go through the winter in good condition, and are most likely to produce healthy young (7). Leaves are used for nest building by birds, squirrels, and raccoons (11). Cavities provide nests and dens for various birds and mammals. Considered a beautiful shade tree for parks, post oak is often used in urban forestry. It is also planted for soil stabilization on dry, sloping, stony sites where few other trees will grow. It develops an attractive crown with strong horizontal branches. Large trees are difficult to transplant and do not tolerate compaction or removal of soil in developments (19). The wood of post oak, commercially called white oak, is classified as moderately to very resistant to decay (16). It is used for railroad ties, lathing, siding, planks, construction timbers, mine timbers, trim molding, stair risers and treads, flooring (its highest volume finished products), fenceposts, pulp, veneer, particle boards, and fuel. The bark provides tannin, decorative and protective mulch in landscaping, and fuel. The tannin in oak leaves, buds, and acorns is toxic to cattle, sheep, and goats. Oak poisoning is a problem in the Southwest where annual livestock losses costing more than $10 million have been estimated. Poisoning occurs more frequently in drought years when other forage is in short supply. The most dangerous season is during the sprouting of new foliage, a period of about 4 weeks in March and April (9).",Special Uses,Post Oak,quercus,stellata,hardwood,16,0
"Striped maple is a common but minor forest component, appearing as an understory species in the boreal hardwoods and in the spruce-fir and northern hardwood types of the northern forest region.

The species appears to be diploid over the northern part of its range (38). Sex expression was studied in two different samples of 69 and 243 trees each in western Massachusetts.

"Flowering and Fruiting-Sex expression in striped maple is variable. It can be monoecious, with male and female flowers on the same tree, or dioecious, with some trees male and others female (11,18,33,35,38); the same tree may differ in expression from year to year (13,21). Sex expression varied in a sample of 312 trees taken under natural habitat conditions in western Massachusetts. Four percent of the trees sampled were monoecious and 96 percent were dioecious. The ratio of female to male flowering trees under the latter condition was 8 to 1 (15). Sex expression changed for six of eight specimens of striped maple growing under arboretum conditions in Europe. In annual observations made over a period of 2 to 6 years, dioecy appeared 15 times and monoecy 10 times (21). The ratio of male to female trees under the dioecious conditions was 1 to 14. There is a strong possibility that sex expression is influenced by environmental effects. In one year, 27 trees of 243 changed sex. Most changes were from male to female (13,15). Trees bearing female flowers tended to be less vigorous than those bearing male flowers. Flowering trees, including both sexes, averaged 52/ha (21/acre). As an understory tree, striped maple has a high mortality rate. During the year, nearly 65 percent of the female trees under observation died. Striped maple produces a crop of flowers each year, under either arboretum (21) or natural (13,15) conditions. Blooming occurs in May and June (40) and begins after the leaves are nearly mature (1,35,38). Flowers are usually pseudohermaphroditic, yellow, and about 6 mm (0.25 in) in diameter, occurring in pendulous racemes that range from 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) in length. Functional male flowers have a rudimentary pistil that may occasionally be absent; functional female flowers develop stamens but the pollen sacs do not dehisce. A few flowers have been found that appear to be functionally perfect. Flowering may occur among trees as young as 11 years old and as small as 1 m (3.3 ft) in height (13,15). Fruits of striped maple are samaras borne on pedicels ranging from 10 to 15 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in length. Their color is somewhat reddish in early development, changing later to tan. Wings are widely divergent with nutlets about 20 mm (0.8 in) long. Seed Production and Dissemination-Most fruits and seeds of striped maple ripen in September and October and are dispersed in October and November (40). Seed production varies from tree to tree; some trees produce as few as 10 seeds, whereas others produce several thousand. The density of seed dispersal from a tree drops quickly as the distance from the tree increases. At 10 m (33 ft) from a seed tree the average number of seeds was 13.75 per square meter (1.28/ft²). At 60 m (200 ft) the number dropped to 1.25 seeds per square meter (0.1/ft²). Seeds that fall on crusted snow cover may be blown as far as 4 km (2.48 mi) from the seed tree (14). The number of cleaned seeds varies from 21,400 to 34,400/kg (9,700 to 15,600/lb) averaging 24,500/kg (11,100/lb) (40). Seedling Development- Newly collected striped maple seeds are dormant and must receive moist stratification at 5°C (41°F) for 0 to 120 days to germinate (40). Mature seeds covered only by the current year's leaf litter do not germinate until the second year but, if buried under soil or humus, germinate the first year. There also seems to be a testaimposed dormancy in the species which causes mechanical restriction of radicle elongation. Seeds would not germinate after stratification of 30 to 90 days with the testae intact, but when testae were removed from over the radicles, germination was rapid and complete. Unstratified seeds with the testae removed from over the radicles and treated with benzyladenine germinated 100 percent at 23° C (74° F) (49). Delay in germination of striped maple seed was reduced when two-thirds of the basal area of the stand was removed and was completely eliminated when the stand was clearcut (29). In the clearcut, however, total germination dropped sharply with the complete removal of the overstory. Seed germination is epigeal, with the radicle first to emerge. Soon after the emergence and elongation of the radicle, the shoot begins its upward growth. The cotyledons unfold and are followed by the formation of the first pair of leaves. The leaf margins are serrate and lobes are usually absent. The leaf area is small, ranging from about 25 to 65 mm (1 to 2.5 in) (5). Suppressed new seedlings generally grow less than 30 mm (1.2 in) per year and mortality is nearly 90 percent after the first growing season. In the following 15 years, the mortality rate drops to less than 1 percent per year. Between 15 and 40 years of age, mortality rises to 3.8 percent per year but drops to 1.6 percent after 40 years (13,14). Vegetative Reproduction-Vegetative reproduction does not seem to play an important part in the reproduction of the species. Although striped maple reproduces by layering and basal sprouting, sampling of a striped maple population showed that only 3 percent of the trees originated from layering and 8 percent by sprouting (15). In general, natural vegetative propagation of the species seems to be a mechanism by which it survives suppression rather than increasing its numbers. The first leaves of sprouts are small, with coarse serrations, and are unlobed. Sprouting begins relatively soon after a tree dies. Sprouts appeared around the main stem of understory trees within 2 months after main stems were killed in a prescribed burn. In vitro culture of striped maple has been successful. Callus tissue was formed in a medium consisting of a mixture of coconut milk, naphthalene acetic acid, sucrose, and salt (31).",Reproduction and Early Growth,"PUBLIC ""-//SoftQuad//DTD HoTMetaL PRO 4.0::19971010::extensions to HTML 4.0//EN""

"Growth and Yield-Striped maple develops best under moderate light intensity. Rapid shoot growth under low light intensity can occur but the growth resembles etiolation (48). Under direct sunlight striped maple may be succeeded by mountain maple (19). The species is well adapted to survival under heavy shade. As a suppressed understory tree, its growth and development are extremely slow. Height growth over a 10-year period may be as little as 30 cm (12 in), but trees that have been heavily suppressed for 35 to 40 years respond well to release(13,14). Growth rate of trees following the removal of the overstory is correlated with growth rate before over-story removal, whether or not they were previously growing in a suppressed or released state. The maximum rate of growth observed among released striped maple under optimum light was 1 m (3.3 ft) per year. The species grows well in small forest openings and under a thinned overstory that results in moderate understory lighting. Because its maximum height growth is about 15 m (49 ft), it will never become a major member in the upper canopy of the northern hardwood forest cover type, though the species has been known to occupy forest openings for more than 100 years (13,14). Rooting Habit- The root system of striped maple is shallow and wide-spreading (18), illustrating its adaptation to an understory position in the forest. Because it is protected from wind damage by the dominant trees in the overstory, it does not need a deep root system designed for strong support, and its shallow, spreading features make it strongly competitive for soil moisture and nutrients. Reaction to Competition- The species is ideally suited to expanding and developing its understory position in the forest should the situation arise. Large numbers of small trees that are capable of surviving from year to year under heavy shade await a disturbance in the upper canopy. They show an instant response to increased light even though overtopped for as long as 35 to 40 years. The species does not require full sunlight to realize its maximum growth potential but grows best under moderate lighting found in partial or small forest openings. Striped maple is classed as very tolerant of shade. Sexual reproduction in striped maple is closely associated with changes in the upper canopy, resulting in regeneration of the trees that will be stored in the understory (13,15). Asexual propagation is capable of regenerating individual trees within a few months. Striped maple is often considered a serious silvicultural problem. When large numbers of this species occupy an understory before cutting, they frequently become the dominant vegetation after cutting, excluding more desirable species (17). In Allegheny hardwood stands in northwestern Pennsylvania, Marquis and others (30) found that when more than 30 percent of the 1.83-m (6-ft) radius regeneration plots had more than eight striped maple seedlings before clearcutting, these species became dominant after cutting. If the number of striped maple stems exceeds these recommendations, it is essential to reduce their number before harvest cutting to permit establishment of regeneration of desirable hardwood species. Striped maple can be controlled with glyphosate applied with a mistblower at the rate of 1.12 kg/ha (1 lb/acre) a.i. Best kill was achieved when applied from July 1 through September 1 (17). Damaging Agent- Probably the most serious enemy of striped maple is Verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum), a soil-borne stem disease that kills the trees it attacks (12). Less destructive to the species is Cristulariella depraedens, one of the common leaf spot diseases found on a number of other maple species (36). Although Pezicula trunk and branch cankers are found on several maple species, Pezicula subcarnea attacks striped maple only (9). P acericola occasionally appears on striped maple but is most common on mountain maple. The species is relatively free of insect attack. However, it is subject to infestation by one of the flatheaded borers, Agrilus politus, which forms stem galls (4).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,"PUBLIC ""-//SoftQuad//DTD HoTMetaL PRO 4.0::19971010::extensions to HTML 4.0//EN""

"Striped maple is found on brown and gray-brown podzolic soils (orders Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Spodosols) that characterize the areas of mixed coniferous and hardwood forests. It also grows on the strongly weathered and leached podzols (order Spodosols) as well as on darker melanized soils (order Mollisols) (3,47). Compared to other species in the genus Acer, which are relatively indifferent to soil reaction, striped maple prefers acid soils (42,45). Neither the range in soil pH nor the optimum acidity level is known for the species. Soil moisture and texture influence the local distribution of striped maple. It is common on sandy loams that are moist and well drained (23,42). A study of local distribution in western Massachusetts showed that on study plots where striped maple was present there was a positive correlation between species density and windthrow mounds that resulted in small openings in the stand. No significant correlations were found with depths of organic and A horizons, rock outcrops, or stoniness of soils (13,16). In areas of granitic drift in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, striped maple of sapling size was most abundant (15 percent of total basal area) on soils with a matrix of sharp-angled or rounded boulders or on nearly pure weathered granite found not more than 65 cm (26 in) below the top of mineral soil (24). On wet compact till and on washed till, the species made up 6.8 percent and 7.3 percent of the stand basal area, respectively It is one of five species that seems to be permanent and abundant in local distribution on a well-drained, fine, sandy loam podzol in the White Mountains (23). Striped maple and its associates are found on glaciated knoll tops and slopes in Quebec (26). In the mountainous areas of New England, it develops best at elevations between 550 and 800 m (1,800 and 2,600 ft) (2,42). It apparently does not do well at higher elevations in the northeast. In two transects beginning at 610 and 630 m (2,000 and 2,070 ft) at different locations in the white Mountains of New Hampshire, striped maple was only 2 to 4 percent of the basal area of the forest stand (25). It dropped out completely between elevations of 830 and 860 m (2,720 and 2,820 ft). Density of striped maple in western Massachusetts increased with a slope up to 450 and with an elevation up to 700 m (2,300 ft) (13,16). Growth increased on northerly facing, local aspects and on steeper slopes and towards the top of slopes. In the southern Appalachian Mountains, the species is common on mesic sites with an elevation between 760 and 1370 m (2,500 and 4,500 ft); above this elevation it disappears very rapidly (46). Striped maple attains its best growth on shaded, cool northern slopes in deep valleys (18). It can exist under a number of different combinations of environmental factors, but as a mesophyte it favors habitats where moisture conditions are moderate.",Soils and Topography,"PUBLIC ""-//SoftQuad//DTD HoTMetaL PRO 4.0::19971010::extensions to HTML 4.0//EN""

"Probably the most important use of striped maple is for wildlife food. It is one of the preferred species for rabbits and is frequently eaten by porcupines (6,34). It provides browse for deer and moose, though the net energy derived from winter browse is relatively low (27,32,44). The samaras are eaten, to a limited extent, by ruffed grouse (22). when Populus species are lacking, striped maple is eaten by beavers and it is browsed by woodland caribou during summer months (41,44). Striped maple is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree. Because it does poorly in full sun-light, it must be planted with other species. It was introduced into England about 1760, and into continental Europe shortly thereafter where reportedly it reached heights of 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) with trunk diameters up to 45 cm (18 in). The wood of the species is diffuse-porous, white, and fine grained, and on occasions has been used by cabinet makers for inlay material. Botanists who visited North America in the early 18th century found that farmers in the American colonies and in Canada fed both dried and green leaves of the species to their cattle during the winter. when the buds began to swell in the spring, they turned their horses and cows into the woods to browse on the young shoots. An active antitumor substance has been isolated from striped maple, and tests are underway to determine its practical application (10).",Special Uses,"PUBLIC ""-//SoftQuad//DTD HoTMetaL PRO 4.0::19971010::extensions to HTML 4.0//EN""

"Pumpkin ash is listed as a minor component of three forest cover types: Baldcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 101), Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102), and Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103) (1). Other species associated with pumpkin ash are red maple (Acer rubrum) and silver maple (A. saccharinum), blackwillow (Salix nigra), Carolina ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), swamp cottonwood (Populus heterophylla), water-elm (Planera aquatica), and water locust (Gleditsia aquatica). On the better drained sites, overcup oak Quercus lyrata), swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii), willow oak (Q. phellos), water oak (Q. nigra), water hickory (Carya aquatica), American elm (Ulmus americana), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Nuttall oak (Q. nuttallii) in the Mississippi River bottoms; laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and sweetbay (Magnolia uirginiana) are also present.

"Pumpkin ash is found locally along swamp margins and river bottoms, chiefly in the Atlantic Coastal Plain from southern Maryland and southeastern Virginia to northern Florida, and west to Louisiana. It also grows in the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys from southern Illinois and Indiana, south through southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. Its range, however, is quite discontinuous. -The native range of pumpkin ash.",Native Range,Pumpkin Ash,fraxinus,profunda,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Pumpkin ash is dioecious, flowering in April and May before the leaves flush. The fruit is a winged, single-seeded samara and is borne in clusters. Pumpkin ash has the largest seed of the native ash species; seeds average 6.1 to 7.1 cm (2.4 to 2.8 in) in length and 9 mm (0.35 in) in width (4). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production begins at an early age; the youngest seedbearing age has been reported to be 10 years. The seeds mature in late summer, and fall between October and December. Most of the seeds are wind dispersed, though some dispersal by water occurs and may be important to regeneration under some conditions. Seeds remain viable in water for several months. There are no published data on abundance and periodicity of seed crops; however, pumpkin ash is apparently not a prolific seeder (6). Number of cleaned seed averages 7,050/kg (3,200/lb). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Pumpkin ash, in common with its associate green ash, reproduces best on bare, moist soil in openings. Seedlings are moderately shade tolerant and grow rapidly provided that the site is not totally preempted by ground cover or a dense overstory. They are tolerant of saturated soil conditions (2). Vegetative Reproduction- Sapling and pole-size ash sprout readily. The sprouts grow rapidly and can rise above seedlings of most other species very quickly (3).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Pumpkin Ash,fraxinus,profunda,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Pumpkin ash is a large tree, reaching a height of 40 m (130 ft) and a diameter at breast height of 173 cm (68 in) on the best sites. On the wettest sites it commonly develops a swollen or pumpkin-shaped butt, hence its name. There are no published growth or yield data, and in practice it has not been practical to distinguish it from green ash either for management purposes or in its utilization (3). The species can be readily planted. Unpublished records for a plantation in the Mississippi Delta show that trees planted on a cleared site at a square spacing of 3.7 m (12 ft) averaged 6.7 m (22 ft) in height and 8.9 cm (3.5 in) in d.b.h. at age 6. Rooting Habit- There is no published information on rooting habits. Reaction to Competition- Pumpkin ash is tolerant of shading when young and grows more rapidly than green ash. It becomes less tolerant as it ages. Overall, it is most accurately classed as intermediate in shade tolerance. Pumpkin ash, along the margins of swamps and sloughs, grows very slowly. At somewhat higher elevations, where the soils are better drained, it grows more rapidly (6). Damaging Agents- Pumpkin ash is very susceptible to fire. It is moderately susceptible to dieback during drought on the wettest sites. Upper stem heartrot (Lentinus tigrinus) may be severe in overmature trees. There are no published data on specific insect or disease problems (3).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Pumpkin Ash,fraxinus,profunda,hardwood,14,0
"Pumpkin ash is found on wet to very wet sites where, in years of normal rainfall, surface water stands well into the growing season. Sites include the margins of swamps and deep sloughs, very low, poorly drained flats of the major river floodplains, swamps of tidal estuaries, margins of coastal marshes, and the deeper, more extensive depressions of the Coastal Plain. The soils are mineral and usually range in texture from silt loam to clay loam. Swamps and depressions usually have a surface of muck or shallow peat. Soils in the central part of the range belong to the Alfisols and Entisols, while those in the east and south include the Spodosols and Ultisols (5).",Soils and Topography,Pumpkin Ash,fraxinus,profunda,hardwood,15,0

"Quaking aspen grows with a large number of trees and shrubs over its extensive range. It is a major component of three forest cover types (72), Aspen (Eastern Forest) (Society of American Foresters Type 16), Aspen (Western Forest) (Type 217), and White Spruce-Aspen (Type 251). It is a minor component of 35 other types and an occasional to rare component in 3 types. Shrub species commonly associated with quaking aspen in the eastern part of its range include beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), American hazel (C. americana), mountain maple (Acer spicatum), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), American green alder (A. crispa), dwarf bush -honeysuckle (Diervilla lonicera), raspberries and blackberries (Rubus spp.), and various species of gooseberry (Ribes) and willow (Salix). Additional species occurring with quaking aspen in the prairie provinces include: snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), highbush cranberry (Viburnum edule), limber honeysuckle (Lonicera dioica), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana), and several species of rose (Rosa). The latter two also occur in Alaska plus such additional species as Scouler willow (Salix scouleriana), bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), russet buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis), mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitisidaea), and highbush cranberry. In the Rocky Mountains, shrubs commonly occurring with quaking aspen include mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), western serviceberry, chokecherry, common juniper (Juniperus communis), creeping hollygrape (Berberis repens), woods rose (Rosa woodsii), myrtle pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), redberry elder (Sambucus pubens), and a number of Ribes (69,70,72,78,85,91). Herbs characteristic of quaking aspen stands in the east include largeleaf aster (Aster macrophyllus), wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis), Canada beadruby (Maianthemum canadense), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), yellow beadlily (Clintonia borealis), roughleaf ricegrass (Oryzopsis asperifolia), sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum), sweetfern (Comptonia perigrina), lady fern (Athyrium filix-femina), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and several species of sedges (Carex spp.) and goldenrods (Solidago spp.). In the West, the herbaceous component is too rich and diverse to describe. Forbs dominate most sites, and grasses and sedges dominate others (72).",Associated Forest Cover,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,1,0
"Climatic conditions vary greatly over the range of the species, especially winter minimum temperatures and annual precipitation. The known widest range in temperatures aspen has endured in the conterminous United States is in Montana, where January lows of -57° C (-70° F) and summer highs of 41° C (105° F) have been recorded. In Alaska and northwest Canada, part of the range lies within the permafrost zone, but quaking aspen grows only on the warmest sites free of permafrost (28,91). At the eastern end of the range, in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, the climate is mild, humid, and snowfall is extremely heavy, 300 cm (120 in) or more per year. Some representative climates for the northern and eastern limits of quaking aspen as well as for the warmer parts of its eastern range are as follows (78): In the central Rocky Mountains, where altitude plays an important role in the distribution of aspen, the lower limit of its occurrence coincides roughly with a mean annual temperature of 7° C (45° F). In Colorado and southern Wyoming, quaking aspen grows in a narrow elevational belt of 2100 to 3350 m (6,900 to 11,000 ft). Average annual precipitation in this belt ranges from 410 to 1020 mm (16 to 40 in). The southern limit of the range of aspen in the Eastern United States is roughly delineated by the 24° C (75° F) mean July temperature isotherm. In Canada the mean annual degree-day sum of 700° C (1260° F) with a threshold temperature 5.6° C (42° F) coincides closely with the northern limit of the species (51,69, 70,78,80). Quaking aspen occurs where annual precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration. It is abundant in interior Alaska where annual precipitation is only about 180 mm (7 in) because evapotranspiration is limited by cool summer temperatures. In the interior west the 2.5 cm (I in) average annual surface water runoff isopleth is more coincident with the range of aspen than is any isotherm. This isopleth also is coincident with the southern limit of aspen in the prairie provinces of Canada eastward to northwestern Minnesota and south to Iowa where high summer temperatures limit growth and longevity. In summary, the range of quaking aspen is limited first to areas of water surplus and then to minimum or maximum growing season temperatures (33,71,91).",Climate,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,2,0
"The vegetative cells of aspen, as well as those of nearly all aspen hybrids, contain 19 pairs of chromosomes. A number of triploid aspen (with three sets of chromosomes rather than the normal two) have been located in Utah, the Lake States, and Colorado. A few albino aspen seedlings have been observed, as have two albino aspen suckers, which were thought to result from a somatic mutation in aspen root tissue (30,37,78).",Genetics,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,7,0
"Quaking aspen is- known to hybridize naturally with the following species (hybrid names and authors are given in parentheses): Populus alba (P. x heimburgeri Boivin) P. angustifolia (P. x senni Boivin) P. balsamifera (P. x dutillyi Lepage) P. balsamifera x deltoides (P x polygonifolia Barnard) P. deltoides (P. x bernardii Boivin) P. grandidentata (P. x smithii Boivin, P. x barnesii W. H. Wagner) (49). Natural hybrids between P. tremuloides and P. grandidentata have been reported in lower Michigan, Massachusetts, and Canada (8,13,78). Such hybrids are moderately fertile, and backcrosses with parent species are possible (13). Many backcross individuals are indistinguishable between P. tremuloides or P. x smithii so the true extent of hybridization, backcrossing, and gene flow between these native aspens is difficult to determine (31). Natural hybrids between the European Populus alba and P. tremuloides have been reported from Michigan (8) and occur in a number of localities in the vicinity of Ottawa, ON (78). This cross produces viable seed, as does a cross of P. x canescens (Ait.) Sm. with P. tremuloides. Populus tremuloides also crosses readily with P.tremula L., the European aspen. Crosses between diploid P. tremuloides females and a tetraploid male P. tremula from Sweden have produced triploid progeny with exceptionally improved growth. Numerous other artificial crosses have been made but only P. tremuloides x davidiana Dode (Asiatic aspen) has shown much promise for commercial use. Little intraspecific breeding of quaking aspen has been done (7,78,81). One particularly important limitation of almost all quaking aspen inter- and intraspecific hybrids is that rooting progeny asexually by woody stem cuttings is extremely difficult. Other Populus that root easily in this manner have a decided advantage for mass-producing inexpensive and easily handled planting stock. Nevertheless, P. tremuloides, P. tremula, and their hybrids can be propagated commercially by culturing meristematic explants from buds (1). P. tremuloides is more closely related to P. tremula than to P. grandidentata (12).",Hybrids,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,9,0
"Quaking aspen grows singly and in multi-stemmed clones over 111° of longitude and 48° of latitude for the widest distribution of any native tree species in North America (48). The range extends from Newfoundland and Labrador west across Canada along the northern limit of trees to northwestern Alaska, and southeast through Yukon and British Columbia. Throughout the Western United States it is mostly in the mountains from Washington to California, southern Arizona, Trans-Pecos Texas, and northern Nebraska. From Iowa and eastern Missouri it ranges east to West Virginia, western Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Quaking aspen is also found in the mountains of Mexico, as far south as Guanajuato. Worldwide, only Populus tremula, European aspen, and Pinus sylvestris, Scotch pine, have wider natural ranges. -The native range of quaking aspen.",Native Range,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Quaking aspen is primarily dioecious. The pendulous flower catkins, 3.8 to 6.4 cm (1.5 to 2.5 in) long, generally appear in April or May (mid-March to April in New England, May to June in central Rockies) before the leaves expand (28,66,78,91). Local clonal variation provides early and late flowering clones of each sex in most stands. In addition, certain flowers bloom later than others, usually those on the distal end of a given catkin or small catkins on spurlike shoots (13). Maximum air temperatures above 12° C (54° F) for a period of about 6 days appear to be the principal factor governing timing of flowering. Flowers are pollinated by wind. The fruiting catkins are about 10 cm (4 in) long when mature, usually in May or June-about 4 to 6 weeks after flowering. Each catkin may bear several dozen one-celled capsules, light green, each nearly 6 min (0.25 in) long. Each capsule contains about 10 small brown seeds, each of which is surrounded by tufts of long, white silky hairs. Although the flowers are typically unisexual, 10 to 20 percent of the predominantly female trees and 4 to 5 percent of the predominantly male trees bear perfect flowers. Trees in a given clone, therefore, are usually either all male or all female. Some studies in the eastern United States found male-to-female ratios of about 3 to 1 in natural populations; others have reported no deviation from an expected 1-to-1 ratio (66,78). In the Colorado Rockies, male clones were more common at high elevations and female clones were more common at low elevations. Furthermore, female clones had faster radial growth than male clones, especially at lower elevations. This runs counter to the theory that the high metabolic cost of sexual reproduction for females is compensated for by reduced vegetative growth (36). Seed Production and Dissemination- Good seed crops are produced every 4 or 5 years, with light crops in most intervening years. Some open-grown clones may produce seeds annually, beginning at age 2 or 3. The minimum age for large seed crops is 10 to 20; the optimum is 50 to 70. One 23-year-old quaking aspen produced an estimated 1.6 million seeds (51,59,78). Seeds are very light, 5,500 to 8,000 clean seeds per gram (156,000 to 250,000/oz). Seeds begin to be dispersed within a few days after they ripen and seed dispersal may last from 3 to 5 weeks. The seeds, buoyed by the long silky hairs, can be carried for many kilometers by air currents. Water also serves as a dispersal agent (78,91). The viability of fresh fertile seeds is high (usually greater than 95 percent) but normally of short duration. Under favorable conditions viability lasts only 2 to 4 weeks after maturity and may be much less under unfavorable conditions. When air dried and stored in polyethylene bags at -10° C (14° F), seed retains high viability for at least I year. Seedlings are sturdiest when germinated at 5° to 29° C (41° to 84° F) and grown at about 20° C (68° F). Ripe quaking aspen seeds are not dormant, and germination occurs within a day or two after dispersal if a suitably moist seedbed is reached. Because germination declines rapidly after water potential exceeds -4 bars (-.4 MPa), a water-saturated seedbed is critical. Seeds germinate even when totally submerged in water or in the absence of light (32,47,50,66,78,92). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. The primary root of a seedling grows very slowly for several days, and during this critical period the young plant depends upon a brush of long delicate hairs to perform the absorptive functions and anchor the seedling to the seedbed. Exposed mineral soils are the best seedbeds and litter the poorest seedbeds (28,51,60,78). During the first year seedlings may attain a height of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) and develop a 20- to 25-cm (8- to 10-in) long taproot and from 30- to 40-cm (12 to 16-in) long laterals. During the second and third years, wide-spreading lateral roots are developed, reaching lengths of 2 m (6 ft) or more in the second year. Quaking aspen roots form ectomycorrhizae if suitable inoculum is present (28,78,86). Despite the abundance of aspen seed and high germinative capacity, few aspen seedlings survive in nature because of the short period of seed viability, unfavorable moisture during seed dispersal, high soil surface temperatures, fungi, adverse diurnal temperature fluctuations during initial seedling growth, and the unfavorable chemical balance of some seedbeds (51,52). Height growth of the young trees is rapid for about the first 20 years and slows thereafter. During the first several years, natural seedlings grow faster than planted seedlings but not as fast as suckers. High mortality characterizes young quaking aspen stands regardless of origin. In both seedling and sucker stands natural thinning is rapid, and trees that fall below the canopy stop growing and die within a few years (78,93). Vegetative Reproduction- The aggregation of stems (ramets) produced asexually from a single sexually produced individual (the genet) is termed a clone. In aspen a clone is formed from the root system of the seedling genet following an event (cutting, fire) that destroys the genet (9). Quaking aspen seedlings at 1 year of age are already capable of reproducing by root sprouts (suckers), and mature stands reproduce vigorously by this means (19,43). Root collar sprouts and stump sprouts are produced only occasionally by mature trees but saplings commonly produce them (77). Aspen clones vary widely in many characteristics, even over a small area. Members of a clone are indistinguishable but can be distinguished from those of a neighboring clone by electrophoresis and often by a variety of traits such as leaf shape and size, bark character, branching habit, resistance to disease and air pollution, sex, time of flushing, and autumn leaf color (9,10,11,17,22,23,57,87). Clones typically have many ramets over an area up to a few tenths of a hectare in stands east of the Rocky Mountains (45,76). In the Rockies, clones tend to be much larger-one Utah clone covered 43.3 ha (107 acres) and contained an estimated 47,000 ramets. Clone size in an aspen stand is primarily a function of clone age, number of seedlings initially established, and the frequency and degree of disturbance since seedling establishment (46). The root suckers are produced from meristems on the shallow, cordlike lateral roots within 2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) of the soil surface (28,81). In response to clone disturbance, the meristems may develop into buds and then elongate into shoots. Frequently, however, they remain in the primordial stage until stimulated to develop further. These preexisting primordia are visible as small bumps when cork is peeled off an aspen root (63). The development of suckers on aspen roots is suppressed by apical dominance exerted by auxin transported from growing shoots, while cytokinins, hormones synthesized in root tips, apparently initiate adventitious shoot development. When an aspen is cut, cytokinins accumulate in the roots, the supply of inhibitory auxins is eliminated, and suckers are initiated. If aspen is girdled, the downward transport of auxin again is stopped, but upward translocation of cytokinins via the xylem is unimpeded. Cytokinins in this case do not accumulate in the roots, with consequently less sucker production. Thus high cytokinin-to-auxin ratios favor shoot initiation while low ratios inhibit it. A gibberellic-acid-like growth regulator also stimulates shoot elongation after sucker initiation. Carbohydrate reserves supply the energy needed by elongating suckers until they emerge at the soil surface to carry on their own photosynthesis. Therefore, the density of regeneration varies according to the level of these reserves. However, the number of suckers initiated by aspen roots is independent of variation in carbohydrate levels. Apical dominance by elongating suckers further limits the total amount of regeneration. Carbohydrates can be exhausted by grazing, repeated cropping or killing of sucker stands, or insect defoliation (63,77,82). Soil temperature is the most critical environmental factor affecting suckering. Initiation and development of suckers is optimum at about 23° C (74° F). High temperatures tend to degrade auxin and promote cytokinin production, which may account in part for the aspen invasion of grassland without apparent clone disturbance (51,82). Excess soil moisture (impeded aeration) or severe drought inhibit sucker production (25,57,82). Light is not needed for sucker initiation but is essential for secondary growth (78). Large clonal. differences in ability to produce suckers may be due to differences in growth regulators, carbohydrate reserves, and developmental stages of shoot primordia (63). Some clones in the interior West are unevenaged, suggesting weak apical control or high concentration of growth-promoting hormones so that they sucker at the least disturbance (69,82). Suckers are initially sustained by the root system of the parent tree, but they may form as much as 4.7 in (15.5 ft) of new main roots in 10 weeks. In contrast, suckers of some Utah clones produce only weak adventitious roots and depend on the distal parent root for sustenance. The parent root usually thickens at the point of sucker origin distal to the parent tree. This indicates that translocation of food produced by the sucker is toward the growing tip of the parent root, which usually becomes part of the new root system (28,51,78,81). These connections readily conduct water and solutes from tree to tree (27). True root grafts, in contrast, are rare in aspen. Suckers from the roots of badly decayed trees are not infected by the parent stump. Heart rot usually terminates in the base of the stump. Deteriorating clones, however, produce few suckers. In general, sucker regeneration is proportional to the degree of cutting, with most suckers arising after a complete clearcut (43,57,64,65,75,78). Typically, from 25,000 to 75,000 suckers per hectare (10,000 to 30,000/acre) are regenerated in Alaska and the Great Lakes region and about half as many in the Rockies (28,91). Light burning on heavily cut areas increases the number of suckers and stimulates their initial growth. However, hot slash fires diminish sucker vigor. Repeated burning increases stand density because it stimulates sucker numbers and prepares mineral soil seedbeds for seedling establishment; however, it reduces stand growth (6,19,28,56,64,78). Surface fires in established aspen stands are not common because of aspen's inherently low flammability. When they do occur, fire wounds and loss of shallow feeder roots substantially reduce aspen productivity. Fire is a useful tool, however, to stimulate regeneration and to reduce competition if clearcutting is not practiced. It is especially valuable for regenerating deteriorated stands and for maintaining wildlife habitat (21,57). Disking stimulates suckering, but sucker growth and survival are usually diminished because of injury to their sustaining parent roots. Rows of suckers often appear along furrows prepared for planting conifers. Herbicides have been used to kill residual trees and to increase suckering without affecting sucker growth or vigor (19,57,78). Dormant season cutting generally produces vigorous suckers the next growing season. Summer cutting produces a sparse stand initially, but the number of suckers after 2 years is usually the same regardless of cutting season (15). Suckering sometimes fails inexplicably after hay-vesting aspen on fine-textured soils during the growing season (59). The number of suckers following cutting increases as stocking density of the parent stand increases up to full site utilization. The effect of age and site index on aspen suckering is not clear (35,81). Age of wood is the most important factor in rooting quaking aspen cuttings. With rare exceptions, the species roots poorly from woody stem cuttings, even when treated with indolebutyric acid (IBA). However, newly initiated shoots can usually be induced to root by dipping in IBA or other commercially available rooting powders. These softwood stem cuttings should be taken from actively growing shoots except during the period of extremely rapid mid-season elongation (14,63,78). Propagation by excising succulent young sucker shoots from root cuttings is easily accomplished by treating the shoots with IBA and growing them in a suitable medium in a misting chamber until rooted, in about 2 to 3 weeks (62). Quaking aspen scions can be grafted onto balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), willows (Salix spp.), or bigtooth aspen (P. grandidentata). Quaking aspen plantlets have been produced by tissue culture (81).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Quaking aspen is a small- to medium-sized, fast-growing, and short-lived tree. Under the best of conditions, however, it may attain 36.5 in (120 ft) in height and 137 cm (54 in) in d.b.h. The current national champion is 114 cm (45 in) d.b.h. and 26 in (86 ft) tall near Fort Klamath, OR. More typically, mature stands may range from 20 to 25 in (66 to 82 ft) tall and average 18 to 30 cm (7 to 12 in) d.b.h. A few vigorous trees attain a maximum age of about 200 years (oldest recorded is 226 years) in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain region (28,42). Although individual ramets of a clone may be short lived, the clone may be thousands of years old (46) and longer lived than the oldest giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum). The tallest quaking aspen are found in a belt bordering the midcontinental prairie region at about latitude 55° N., and in north-central Minnesota, northern Michigan, and in the Southwest. Few quaking aspen exceed 26 or 27 in (85 to 90 ft) in Alaska (38). Growth and decay are both generally slower in Alaska and the West than in the East, hence pathological rotations are longer-80 to 90 years in Utah and 110 to 120 years for Colorado and Wyoming. In northern Minnesota, the pathological rotation is about 55 to 60 years and even shorter in southern Wisconsin and Michigan (35,69,70). Now and in the foreseeable future, most aspen will be extensively managed (complete clearing for site preparation, no thinning) for fiberboard, pulpwood, flakeboard, and some sawtimber. Aspen is harvested either as whole-tree chips or as bolewood to a nominal top size for pulpwood or sawtimber. Some of the very best stands can be thinned to increase the production of large bolts (57,58). Site quality varies regionally, being highest in the Lake States, followed by Alaska and the West. Biomass mean annual increment on the better sites in the Lake States and Canada culminates at about age 30 and at 4.4 to 4.8 mg/ha (2-2.2 tons/acre) dry weight (16,60). Mature stands in Newfoundland typically carry 64 m²/ha (280 ft²/acre) basal area. This amounts to 376 mg/ha (167 tons/acre) at age 90 years, or 4.2 mg/ha/yr (1.9 tons/acre/year) (54). However, exceptionally good growth of quaking aspen is possible in Arizona and in Colorado and southern Wyoming (44,70). A natural triploid clone in Minnesota produced an annual yield of 14.6 m³/ha (208 ft³/acre) of bolewood over 38 years (59). Aspen responds to intensive management. Production by thinned stands for a 50-year rotation, including thinnings removed at ages 10, 20, and 30, is about 511 m³/ha (7,300 ft³/acre), or 10.2 m³/ha (146 ft³/acre) per year. This is about 42 percent greater than for similar, but unthinned, stands (58). Quaking aspen growth can be further increased by fertilization and irrigation (24,26,29,59,84). Sub-optimal fiber yield and the threat of Armillaria mellea root rot limit the practicality of rotations shorter than 1520 years (77). Rooting Habit- Seedlings initially have a short taproot, but a heart root system develops on deep, well-drained soils. Clonal ramets have a flat root system when young but again will develop a heart system on deep, well-drained soils. If rooting depth is restricted, a flat root system develops regardless of regeneration origin (28,59). The shallow and extensive laterals have cordlike branch roots that undulate and meander for great distances without tapering. These roots are the main producers of suckers, particularly when they are close to the soil surface. Roots tend to follow soil surface irregularities and may even grow into decaying stumps or logs. The fine feeding roots are found at all levels down to 0.6 to 0.9 in (2 to 3 ft) except in restrictive horizons. Sinker roots occur as frequently as every meter or so on the lateral roots. They may descend to depths of 3 in (10 ft) or more where they end in a dense fan-shaped fine root mass. Sinkers are capable of penetrating strongly massive soil horizons or cracks in bedrock and often use vacated root channels (28,78). Reaction to Competition- In both the eastern and western parts of its range, quaking aspen is classed as very intolerant of shade, a characteristic it retains throughout its life. Natural pruning is excellent, and long, clean stems are usually produced when side shade is present. However, this is a clonally variable characteristic and self-pruned and unpruned clones exist side by side in some stands (69,78). The intolerance of aspen to shade dictates an even-aged silvicultural system, that is, clearcutting, for regenerating fully stocked sucker stands and maximizing growth (19,57,75), The tree has a pronounced ability to express dominance, and overstocking to stagnation of growth is extremely rare. Quaking aspen is an aggressive pioneer. It readily colonizes burns and can hold invaded land even though subjected to fires at intervals as short as 3 years. In the northeastern United States, it is an old-field type, and in Canada it invades grassland if fire is excluded. In the Central Rocky Mountains, it constitutes the typical fire climax at the lower elevations of the subalpine forest. The extensive stands of aspen in that area are usually attributed to repeated wildfires, and aspen is generally regarded as a successional species able to dominate a site until replaced by less fire-enduring but more shade-tolerant conifers, a process that may take only a single aspen generation or as long as 1,000 years of fire exclusion. Aspen is considered a permanent type on some sites in the intermountain region of Utah, Nevada, and southern Idaho, but conifers would invade the type if seed trees were available. The uneven-aged character of some western aspen stands suggests that under certain conditions aspen is self-perpetuating without major disturbance. These stands are relatively stable and can be considered de facto climax. Seral and stable aspen stands seem to be associated with certain indicator species (28,78,82). In its eastern range, aspen in the absence of disturbance is regarded as transient. Successional patterns are determined by soil water regime (61). Pure aspen stands gradually deteriorate to a ""shrubwood"" dominated by the shrub component of the stand and with only a few scattered aspen suckers. If intolerant associates are present, they will outlive the aspen and eventually dominate but in turn will be replaced again by the shrubwood type. If tolerant hardwoods or balsam fir (Abies balsamea) are associated with aspen, they will eventually dominate by their longevity and ability to regenerate in their own shade (81). The deterioration of aspen stands begins earliest at the southern limits of its eastern range and seems to be related to summer temperatures. Deterioration begins when crowns in old stands can no longer grow fast enough to fill the voids in the canopy left by dying trees. Increased breakage accelerates the deterioration process, which may be completed in as few as 3 or 4 years (81). Deterioration is a much slower process in the West, where aspen often is replaced by conifers. Dry sites may revert to rangeland dominated by shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Sometimes suckers appear in a deteriorating stand and ultimately an all-age climax aspen forest develops (28). Damaging Agents- Numerous factors other than competition injure or kill young stands (25,40). Young trees are sometimes killed by bark-eating mammals, such as meadow mice and snowshoe hares, which may girdle the stem at or near the ground line. Also, larger animals, such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, and moose, frequently seriously damage reproduction by browsing and by rubbing their antlers against the stems. Elk and moose can also damage pole- and saw log-size trees by ""barking"" them with their incisors. Such injuries often favor secondary attack by insects or pathogens. Heavy use by overwintering big game animals can greatly reduce the number of aspen trees in localized areas. Cattle and sheep browsing is a serious problem in many areas of the Rockies because livestock are allowed to range through recent aspen clearcuts. Mature aspen stands adjacent to livestock concentrations (water holes, salt blocks, isolated stands in large open areas) often have root damage, are declining, and have few if any suckers present. Excessive use and vandalism by recreationists has caused aspen to deteriorate in many campsites (41,70). Beaver feed on the young tender bark and shoots of aspen and often cut down large numbers of trees near their colonies. A high population of porcupines can greatly damage tree crowns both directly by feeding, and indirectly by increasing the trees' susceptibility to attack by insects and diseases. The red-breasted and yellow-bellied sapsuckers may seriously sear trees with drill holes. Minor damage is caused by such woodland birds as the ruffed grouse and the sharp-tailed grouse, which feed on the buds of quaking aspen; ruffed grouse also feed on the leaves during the summer months (78). Aspen is susceptible to a large number of diseases (28,39,41,81,82). Shoot blight of some aspen caused by Venturia macularis is periodically severe. Angular black spots appear on the leaves, enlarging until the leaf dies. If the infection occurs at the top of the tree, the entire new shoot may be infected, blackened, killed, and bent to form a ""shepherd's crook."" This disease is common in young stands. A similar leaf disease in Wisconsin is caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Two or more species of Ciborinia cause a leaf spot on trees of all ages. When the disease is severe, small trees may be killed, but older ones rarely die. Marssonina populi causes a leaf spot and shoot blight that is especially prevalent and damaging in the western states. It is responsible for occasional severe defoliation. Severe, repeated infection can cause mortality, although susceptibility to this disease varies greatly among clones. Another leaf spot of aspen is caused by Septoria musiva. Several leaf rust fungi of the genus Melampsora infect aspen. M. medusae is common east of the Rocky Mountains. M. abietis-canadensis occurs throughout the range of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and M. albertensis in the West. All can discolor and kill aspen leaf tissue and cause premature autumn leaf drop, but their damage is not serious. Powdery mildew, Erysiphe cichoracearum in the West and the widespread Uncinula salicis can be conspicuous on aspen leaves but probably do little damage. Recently, viruses have been detected in a few quaking aspen clones. Once trees in the clone are infected, regeneration by suckering maintains the infection, which is then impossible to eliminate except by artificially culturing virus-free tissue. The full extent and seriousness of viruses in aspen is unknown but decline of some clones has been attributed to them in both the East and the West. Stain and decay have the greatest direct impact of the many stem pathogens on wood production. The role of microorganisms frequently associated with discoloration is poorly understood because staining also develops in their absence. Bacteria and yeast organisms are commonly associated with ""wetwood,"" a water-soaked condition of live trees that leads to wood collapse during lumber drying. A number of different bacteria and fungi are found in aspen tissue, apparently interacting to follow one another successionally, with bacteria appearing first. Phellinus tremulae causes a white rot of the heartwood at first but may eventually invade the entire stem. It causes the greatest volume of aspen decay and is so prevalent it conceals rot caused by other fungi. Sporophores (fruiting bodies) are the most reliable external indicator of decay. They provide a means to estimate present and future decay. Resistance to this fungus is strongly genetically controlled. Incidence and extent of infection increases with tree age or size but is not strongly related to site (76). Peniophora polygonia is the second most important trunk rot fungus in the West and in Alaska, but it causes little actual cull. Libertella spp. is also an important trunk rot fungus in the West. Other less important trunk rot fungi found on aspen include Radulodon caesearius, Peniophora polygonia, P. rufa, and Pholiota adiposa. More fungi species cause butt and root rots than trunk rots-as much as one-third of the decay volume in Colorado. Collybia velutipes is found in Alaska and causes the greatest amount of butt cull in the West. Ganoderma applanatum may be as important because it also decays large roots, which leads to windthrow. Less important butt rot fungi include Pholiota squarrosa, Gymnopilus spectabilis, Peniophora polygonia, and Armillaria mellea. The latter is primarily a root rot which can infect a high proportion of the trees (74). Other locally important root rots in the West include Phialophora spp. and Coprinus atramentarius. Stem cankers are common diseases of aspen that have a great impact on the aspen resource. Depending on the causal fungus, cankers can kill a tree within a few years or persist for decades. Hypoxylon canker caused by Hypoxylon mammatum is probably the most serious aspen disease east of the Rockies, killing 1 to 2 percent of the aspen annually. It is not an important disease in the West, nor has it been found in Alaska. The infection mode of Hypoxylon is poorly understood but seems to be related to ascospore germination inhibitors in bark. Most canker infections seem to originate in young branches with scars or galls formed by twig-boring insects (4). Once infected, the host bark tissue is rapidly invaded and the fungus girdles and kills the tree in a few years (5). Ceratocystis canker is a target-shaped canker caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata, C. moniliformis, C. piceae, C. pluriannulata, C. ambrosia, C. cana, C. serpens, C. crassivaginata, C. populina, C. tremuloaurea, and C. alba. This canker is found throughout the range of aspen, with C. fimbriata the most common causal pathogen. These cankers seldom kill aspens but can reduce usable volume of the butt log. Infection is primarily through trunk wounds and insects are the primary vectors. Sooty-bark canker of aspen is caused by Phibalis pruinosa and is common and a major cause of mortality in Alaska and the West. The fungus infects trunk wounds and spreads rapidly, killing trees of all sizes. The fungus has been found only as an innocuous bark saprophyte on quaking aspen in the East. Cytospora canker is caused by Cytospora chrysosperma, a normal inhabitant of aspen bark. The fungus is not considered a primary pathogen and causes cankers, lesions, or bark necrosis only after the host tree has been stressed, such as by drought, fire, frost, suppression, or leaf diseases. The disease is most serious on young trees and is found throughout the range of aspen. Dothichiza canker, caused by Dothichiza populea, occurs in the eastern range of aspen. It is an endemic disease of young or weakened trees and is not found in vigorous stands. In Ontario, a canker caused by Neofabraea populi has been found on young aspen. Few trees have been killed by it, however, and the disease is not known in the United States. Cryptosphaeria populina cause a long, narrow, vertical canker that may spiral around an aspen trunk for 1 to 6 in (3 to 20 ft) or more. It is common in the West as far north as Alaska. Trees with large cankers have extensive trunk rot and are frequently broken by wind. Aspen is susceptible to three types of rough-bark which are caused by the fungi Diplodia tumefaciens, Rhytidiella baranyayi, and Cucurbitaria staphula. Rough, corky bark outgrowths persist for many years but do little harm. Quaking aspen hosts a wide variety of insects (28,81). One Canadian survey recorded more than 300 species, but only a few are known to severely damage trees. They may be grouped into defoliators, borers, and sucking insects. Defoliators of aspen belong primarily to the orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacasoma disstria) and the western tent caterpillar (M. californicum) have defoliated aspens over areas as large as 259 000 km² (100,000 mi²). Outbreaks usually persist for 2 to 3 years and may collapse as quickly as they begin (88). Aspen growth losses during defoliation have been as high as 90 percent and may take as long as 3 or 4 years for total growth recovery. Some trees never recover and die as much as 20 to 80 percent of them on poor sites (90). On good sites mortality may be restricted to suppressed trees (59). The large aspen tortrix (Choristoneura conflictana) is found throughout the range of aspen. It has defoliated trees over an area as large as 25 900 km² (10,000 mi²) in Canada and Alaska. Caterpillars predominantly infest the leaves of early flushing clones (89). Outbreaks normally collapse in 2 or 3 years and, although aspen growth is reduced, few trees are killed. In the East, aspen is a favored host for the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and the satin moth (Leucoma salicis) (78). A great number of leaf tiers defoliate aspen. Sciaphila duplex is one that is often associated with the large aspen tortrix and has been a major pest in Utah. Other Lepidopterous defoliators of aspen include the Bruce spanworm, Operophtera bruceata, and Lobophora nivigerata. Three species of leaf-rolling sawflies of the genus Pontania sometimes erupt in local outbreaks in the Lake States. Anacampsis niveopulvella is a Lepidopterous leaf roller that causes local damage in the West. Sawflies of the Platycampus genus chew holes in leaves. The more common leaf miners of aspen are aspen leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella), the aspen blotch miners (Phyllonorycter tremuloidiella and Lithocolletis salicifoliella), and a leaf-mining sawfly (Messa populifoliella). Defoliating beetles include the aspen leaf beetle (Chrysomela crotchi), the cottonwood leaf beetle (C. scripta), the American aspen beetle (Gonioctena americana), and the gray willow leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta decora). All have similar feeding habits; the larvae skeletonize lower surfaces of leaves, and adults feed on whole leaves. Wood-boring insects that attack aspen are primarily beetles of the Cerambycidae (round-headed borers or long-horned beetles) and Buprestidae (flatheaded borers or metallic beetles). The poplar borer (Soperda calcarata) is the most damaging. The larvae tunnel in the bole, weakening and degrading the wood. Breakage by wind increases and the tunnels serve as infection courts for wood-rotting fungi. S. moesta is a smaller related borer that attacks small suckers and aspen twigs. It is important only in the West. Xylotrechus obliteratus has killed large areas of aspen in the West above 2130 in (7,000 ft). The root-boring saperda (Saperda calcarata) feeds on phloem and outer sapwood near the base of young aspen suckers. Oviposition incisions of the poplar gall saperda (S. inornata) frequently cause globose galls to form on the stems of young suckers and on small branches of larger trees. These oviposition wounds can serve as infection sites for Hypoxylon that can then grow from a branch gall down into the bole of the tree causing a canker (4). The poplar branch borer (Oberea schaumi) attacks larger suckers and tree limbs. Damage by all these insects can lead to stem breakage. Site quality is not an important variable, and maintaining high stocking density of vigorous suckers is the best practice to minimize loss. Two flatheaded borers, the bronze poplar borer (Agrilus liragus) and the aspen root girdler (A. horni), bore galleries that disrupt nutrient and water movement. The former attacks sucker stems and makes zig-zag galleries; the latter girdles the sucker with a spiral gallery from the lower trunk to the roots and back. A. anxius also girdles and kills aspen twigs in the West. Some other Buprestids attacking aspen in the East are the flatheaded apple tree borer (Chrysobothris femorata), the Pacific flatheaded borer (C. mali), and the flatheaded aspen borers (Dicerca tenebrica, D. divaricata, and Poecilonota cyanipes). The first two and the latter are also reported in the West, along with the aspen ambrosia beetle (Typodendron retusum). None of these cause serious injury in well-managed stands. A widespread weevil, the poplar and willow borer, Cryptorhynchus lapathi, can riddle aspen stems with galleries, especially planted trees. A clear-wing moth of the genus Aegeria, and willow shoot sawfly (Janus abbreviatus) are examples of borers from nonbeetle families. In the West, the fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata is carried by Epurea spp., Nudobius spp., and Rhisophagus spp. (28). Sucking insects are represented mainly by aphids and leafhoppers. The poplar vagabond aphid (Mordvilkoja vagabunda) causes a peculiar curled and twisted gall of leaves as large as 5 cm (2 in) in diameter at the tip of twigs. Poplar petiole gall and twig gall aphids of the genus Pernphigus produce swellings on leaf petioles. Increased forking of aspen suckers may be caused by high populations of the speckled poplar aphid (Chaitophorus populicola) and the spotted poplar aphid (Aphis maculatae). They are commonly found on expanding aspen sucker leaves (35,81). The genera Idiocerus, Oncomtopia, Macropsis, Oncopsis, and Agallia have several species of leafhoppers that cause leaf browning and slitlike ruptures in the bark of twigs. Only Idiocerus spp. have been found in the West. Several species of scale insects such as the oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes u1mi) are found on aspen but do little damage to healthy trees. Cutworms (moth family Noctuidae larvae) sometimes can cut a large number of succulent new suckers at the ground line. Black carpenter ants (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) frequently use and extend the tunneling made by the poplar borer, causing further damage (35,78). Aspen is highly susceptible to fire damage. Fires may kill trees outright or cause basal scars that serve as avenues of entrance for wood-rotting fungi. Intense fires can kill or injure surface roots and thereby reduce sucker regeneration (19,56,78). Early spring frosts may kill new leaves and shoots and, when especially severe, some of the previous year's shoots. Overwinter freezing can cause frost cracks. Strong wind can uproot or break mature aspen and even moderate wind can crack the bole of trees with lopsided crowns. Hail can bruise the bark of young aspen and, in severe storms, kill entire sapling stands. Aspen suffers little from ice storms or heavy wet snow, except when in leaf. Snow creep on steep slopes can bend or break aspen suckers as tall as 1.2 in (4 ft) (28). Aspen suddenly exposed to full sunlight may suffer sunscald. Pole-size trees are more susceptible than saplings (19,58). Aspen growth and vigor suffer from drought (79), and drought- stressed trees become predisposed to secondary agents such as insects and disease. Mechanical injuries inflicted on aspen bark by thoughtless recreationists can lead to infection by canker disease and eventual death in as few as 10 to 20 years.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,14,0
"Quaking aspen grows on a great variety of soils (mainly Alfisols, Spodosols, and Inceptisols) ranging from shallow and rocky to deep loamy sands and heavy clays (83). Only occasional scattered trees that seldom attain economic size occur on the coarser sands of glacial outwash, the shallowest soils of rock outcrops, and on some Histosols. In the West, it has become established on volcanic cinder cones, and in New England it is one of several species that colonizes immediately after landslides. In the Lake States, it often reforests mining waste dumps and abandoned borrow pits (78). Growth and development are strongly influenced by both physical and chemical properties of soil. The best quaking aspen stands in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin are on soils developed from basic igneous rock, such as basalt, and from neutral or calcareous shales and limestones; the poorest are found on soils derived from granite. Some of the best stands of quaking aspen are in the northern part of the Lake States and in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, on Boralfs that have developed from the Keewatin drift, a gray glacial drift rich in lime. Good aspen soils are usually well drained, loamy, and high in organic matter, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and nitrogen. Because of its rapid growth and high nutrient demand, quaking aspen has an important role in nutrient cycling (2,3,18,28,78). Growth on sandy soils is often poor because of low levels of moisture and nutrients. On droughty sands in the western Great Lakes region, the site index at age 50 is usually less than 17 in (56 ft). On the better sandy loams it may be about 21 in (69 ft), and on silt loams 23 to 25 in (75 to 82 ft). The best aspen sites have been found on soils with silt-plus-clay content of 80 percent or more. Wood of the highest mean specific gravity (about 0.40) is produced on welldrained, fine-textured soils, and that of the lowest mean specific gravity (about 0.35) on poorly drained soils (28,71,78). Internal drainage is critical. Water tables shallower than 0.6 m (2 ft) or deeper than 2.5 m (8.2 ft) limit aspen growth. Heavy clay soils do not promote the best growth because of limited available water and poor aeration (35,57,78). Aspen spans an elevational range from sea level on both Atlantic (Maine) and Pacific (Washington) coasts to 3505 in (11,500 ft) in northern Colorado. Near its northern limit, quaking aspen is found at elevations only up to 910 m (3,000 ft). In Baja, California, it does not occur below about 2440 m (8,000 ft). In Arizona and New Mexico it is most abundant between 1980 and 3050 m (6,500 and 10,000 ft); in Colorado and Utah, about 300 in (1,000 ft) higher. At either of its altitudinal limits the tree is poorly developed. In very high exposed places it becomes stunted, with the stem bent or almost prostrate from snow and wind; at its lower limit it is a scrubby tree growing along creeks (28,70,78,91). Quaking aspen is most abundant and grows best on warm south and southwest aspects in Alaska and western Canada. It is common on all aspects in the western mountains of the United States and grows well wherever soil moisture is not limiting. However, the best stands in the Southwest are more frequently found on the northerly slopes where more favorable moisture conditions prevail. Development is poor on physiographic positions with excessive droughtiness. In the prairie provinces of Canada, particularly near the border between prairie and woodland, the species is confined to the cooler and moister north and east slopes and to the depressions (28,69,70,78).",Soils and Topography,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,15,0
"Aspen provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife needing young forests, including hare, black bear, deer, elk, ruffed grouse, woodcock, and a number of smaller birds and animals. Ruffed grouse use all age classes of aspen-sapling stands for brooding, pole stands for overwintering and breeding, and older stands for nesting cover and winter food (53,55,67,68). Aspen forests allow more water or ground water recharge and streamflow than do conifer forests. This is primarily due to lower seasonal water losses to interception and transpiration by aspen compared to conifers (34). Clearcutting the aspen type may increase streamflow by as much as 60 percent during the first year. Subsequently, water yields gradually decline to preharvest levels and stabilize when maximum leaf area is attained at about age 10 to 25 (53). The aspen type is esthetically appealing. The light bark and autumn colors are a pleasing contrast to dark conifers. In the West in particular, the type is used by recreationists during all seasons of the year. Aspen stands produce abundant forage-as much as 1100 to 2800 kg/ha (1,000 to 2,500 lb/acre) in the Rockies annually, or three to six times more than typical conifer stands. These amounts are comparable to forage production on some grasslands. Although the type is sought after for summer sheep and cattle range in the West, its use for grazing in the East is much more limited (28). Aspen stands, because of low fuel accumulations, are low in flammability and make excellent firebreaks. Violent crown fires in conifers commonly drop to the ground and sometimes are even extinguished when they reach an aspen stand (28). Whole-tree aspen chips can be processed into nutritious animal feed (""Muka"") or biomass fuels (82). Aspen could be grown for such purposes in dense sucker stands on biological rotations of 26 to 30 years (16). Wood products from aspen include pulp, flakeboard, particleboard, lumber, studs, veneer, plywood, excelsior, shingles, novelty items, and wood flour. Aspen makes particularly good sauna benches and playground structures because the wood surface does not splinter.",Special Uses,Quaking Aspen,populus,tremuloides,hardwood,16,0
"Swamp chestnut oak is found in the forest cover type Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 91), which varies widely in composition (2). Often swamp chestnut oak and cherrybark oak (Quercus falcata var. pagodifolia) make up a majority of the stocking although if many species are in the mixture, they may account for only a plurality. Other hardwoods are white ash (Fraxinus americana), shagbark (Carya ovata), shellbark (C. laciniosa), mockernut (C. tomentosa), and bitternut (C. cordiformis) hickory Chief associates are white oak Quercus alba), Delta post oak (Q. stellata var. paludosa), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica).

"Swamp chestnut oak extends along the Atlantic Coastal Plain from New Jersey and extreme eastern Pennsylvania, south to north Florida, and west to east Texas; it is found north in the Mississippi River Valley to extreme southeast Oklahoma, Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and locally to southeast Kentucky and eastern Tennessee (6). -The native range of swamp chestnut oak.",Native Range,Quercus michauxii Nutt.,quercus,michauxii,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Flowers of swamp chestnut oak appear about the same time as the leaves, from April to May. Swamp chestnut oak is monoecious. The fruit or acorn is nearly sessile and may be solitary or paired. Its cup is broad based and covers about one-third of the acorn. Scales on the cup are free to the base and are pubescent. Its dimensions are 1.9 to 3.2 cm (0.75 to 1.25 in) wide by 2.5 to 3.8 cm (1 to 1.5 in) long. The acorns ripen and fall during September and October. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees begin to produce seed at about age 20 to 25 and attain their optimum production around age 40. Good seed crops can be expected every 3 to 5 years with poor to fair production the balance of the time. There are about 187 cleaned seeds per kilogram (85/lb), with a range of 77 to 430 (35 to 195) (7). The acorn is very palatable and is eaten by white-tailed deer, wild hogs, and squirrels. Squirrels are perhaps the most helpful animals in disseminating the acorns because they hoard far more than they can actually eat. Seedling Development- Animal activity greatly inhibits regeneration of swamp chestnut oak from seed. Germination, which is hypogeal, usually starts soon after seedfall, with little or no period of dormancy. A moist, well-drained loam, covered with a light litter layer, provides an excellent seedbed. First-year height growth is related to soil type and drainage. Second-year growth is only related to soil type. This suggests that the species is site sensitive (4). The stem of the 1-year-old seedling is generally smooth but is covered near the terminal bud with hairs. At first it is reddish brown but becomes gray after the first year, especially at the base. Small, round, inconspicuous lenticels are found on the upper stem. The terminal bud is about 6 mm (0.25 in) long and light brown. The lateral buds are of the same color but are only about 3 mm (0.125 in) long. A cluster of lateral buds around the terminal bud is common. Vegetative Reproduction- Swamp chestnut oak sprouts, though not prolifically, from roots and stumps.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Quercus michauxii Nutt.,quercus,michauxii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Swamp chestnut oak is a medium-size tree and may attain a height of 30.5 in (100 ft) at maturity on better sites. Heights of 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) with trunk diameters of 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) are normal for average sites. The trunk is often free of branches for 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft). Stout branches ascend at sharp angles to form a very strong crown. Volume of growing stock on commercial forest land in north Georgia for all diameter classes was 5.97 million m³ (211 million ft³. It has also been reported that where swamp chestnut grows with other hardwoods, a total volume in excess of 112 m³/ha (8,000 fbm/acre) is classed as a heavy sawtimber stand. A heavy pole stand is considered to have more than 432 stems/ha (175 stems/acre) ranging from 13 to 28 cm (5 to 21 in) in diameter at breast height. Rooting Habit- No information is currently available. Reaction to Competition- Swamp chestnut oak is classed as intolerant of shade and requires openings for establishment. It normally receives heavy competition from vines, annuals, and brush that are common to most bottom-land hardwood sites. It is reported that when mature, however, this species retards the growth of understory vegetation, probably due to an allelopathic effect (5). Damaging Agents- Numerous fungi and insects damage swamp chestnut oak. The fungi include wood-decaying species of Fomes, Polyporus, and Stereum. Oak leaf blister (Taphrina caerulescens) is sporadic in occurrence, as is oak anthracnose (Gnomonia veneta) (3). Swamp chestnut oak acorns are attacked by weevils such as Curculio pardalis, Conotrachelus naso, and C. posticatus, which consume the seed. Insect defoliators that attack the swamp chestnut are June beetles (Phyllophaga spp.), orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), spring cankerworm (Paleacrita vernata), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), yellownecked caterpillar (Datana ministra), variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), and the redhumped oakworm (Symmerista canicosta). Borers that attack healthy trees are the red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus) in cambium and outer sapwood; carpenterworms (Prionoxystus spp.), in heartwood and sapwood; and the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus), in the sapwood. Those attacking weakened trees include the twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus), in cambium; and the tilehorned prionus (Prionus imbricornis), in roots. Dying trees are attacked by the oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus) (1). The golden oak scale (Asterolecanium variolosum) kills reproduction and tops in older trees. The gouty oak gall (Callirhytis quercuspunctata) and homed oak gall (C. cornigera) injure small limbs, while the basswood leafminer (Baliosus ruber) attacks the leaves.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Quercus michauxii Nutt.,quercus,michauxii,hardwood,14,0

"Red alder grows in both pure and mixed stands. Pure stands are typically confined to stream bottoms and lower slopes. Red alder is, however, much more widely distributed as a component of mixed stands. It is a major component of the forest cover type Red Alder (Society of American Foresters Type 221) and occurs as a minor component in most of the other North Pacific cover types (11). Common tree associates are Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western redcedar (ThuJa plicata), grand fir (Abies grandis), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), and willow (Salix spp.). Occasional tree associates include cascara buckthorn (Rhamnus purshiana), Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), and Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia). Western paper birch (Betula papyrifera var. commutata) is an occasional associate in the northern portion of the range of alder, and redwood (Sequoia semperuirens) in the southern portion. Common shrub associates include vine maple (Acer circinatum), red and blue elder (Sambucus callicarpa, S. cerulea), Indian plum (Osmaronia cerasiformis), salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis), western thimbleberry (R. parviflorus), dlevilsclub (Oplopanax horridum), Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), and salal (Gaultheria shallon).

"Red alder grows in climates varying from humid to superhumid. Annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 5600 mm (16 to 220 in); most of the precipitation is rain in winter. Summers are generally cool and dry. Temperature extremes range from -30° C (-22° F) in Alaska and Idaho to 46° C (115° F) in California. Low winter temperatures and lack of precipitation during the growing season appear to be the main limits to the range of red alder.

"Red alder is most often observed as a lowland species along the northern Pacific coast. Its range extends from southern California (lat. 34° N.) to southeastern Alaska (60° N.). Red alder is generally found within 200 km (125 mi) of the ocean and at elevations below 750 m (2,400 ft). It seldom grows east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington or the Sierra Nevada in California, although several isolated populations exist in northern Idaho (36). . -The native range of red alder.",Native Range,Red Alder,alnus,rubra,hardwood,11,0
"Population differences in height growth, diameter growth, stem form, bark thickness, and resistance to frost or insect attack have been demonstrated in a provenance trial in coastal Oregon involving 10 sources from the range of red alder (5). High growth rates were positively correlated with good form but negatively correlated with resistance to spring frosts. Differences among provenances in bole volume or aboveground biomass were greater than differences in height or diameter alone (24). Specific gravity did not differ significantly among provenances, nor was it correlated with growth rate (17). The fastest growing trees in the provenance trial were from northwestern Washington, but trees from British Columbia, southwestern Washington, and Oregon also grew well. The slowest growing trees were from Alaska and Idaho. Thus, it appears reproductive material of red alder can be moved to mild sites over fairly long distances along the Pacific coast. Differences in form and in characteristics of branch, bark, and wood among eight stands in western Washington have also been assessed (5). Variability among trees in a stand was high; only bark thickness, a branch diameter index, branch angle, and a crown-width index differed significantly among stands. A cut-leaf variety (Alnus rubra var. pinnatisecta) is found in a few isolated areas in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. The cut-leaf characteristic is caused by a single recessive gene (42); thus, the cut-leaf variety can be used as a marker in genetic breeding studies (5). Families varied in their height-growth response to water-table depth in a 24-family progeny trial in western Washington (23). Use of genotypes tolerant of waterlogging may enhance growth of red alder on wet sites. Phenotypic variation between trees is high. Studies are underway to assess genotypic variation and the heritability of various traits. An individual tree approach for selection has been recommended for tree improvement programs. Because red alder has extensive populations of even-aged stands and because of its reproductive and growth characteristics, the species has the potential for rapid genetic gains (5).",Population Differences,Red Alder,alnus,rubra,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Red alder reaches sexual maturity at age 3 to 4 years for individual trees and age 6 to 8 for most dominant trees in a stand (5). It is generally monoecious, with separate male and female catkins developing on the previous year's twigs (22). Staminate catkins occur in pendulous clumps. In late winter they elongate, changing from green to reddish brown and from 2 to 3 cm (1 in) long to about 7 or 8 cm (3 in). Pistillate catkins also occur in clumps but are borne upright. They are 5 to 8 min (0.2 to 0.3 in) long and reddish green when receptive. Flowering occurs in late winter or early spring; peak shedding of pollen generally precedes peak receptivity by only a few days. Most alder seed is probably the result of outcrossing, but some selfpollination does occur (5). Seed Production and Dissemination- Red alder is a prolific and consistent producer of seed. Moderate seed crops are produced almost annually and bumper crops occur every 3 to 5 years. Complete failure of a seed crop is rare, but after a severe freeze in November 1955, almost no seed was produced in 1956 (43). The seeds are small, winged nuts borne in pairs on the bracts of woody, conelike strobili (33). The strobili are 11 to 32 mm (0.4 to 1.3 in) long, and 8 to 15 min (0.3 to 0.6 in) wide. Seed dispersal begins in late September in the middle of the species'range, somewhat earlier in Alaska, and several weeks later in California. Most of the seeds are shed during late fall and winter. For minimum loss of seeds, cone collection should begin in September in Alaska and continue until December in California. Red alder seeds are very light, numbering 800 to 3,000/g (22,900 to 85,700/oz), and wind dissemination is effective. The seed can be carried long distances by wind, and abundant seed for natural regeneration is usually present throughout the range of red alder. Seedling Development- Red alder germinates and grows well on moist mineral soil with full sunlight. Germination is epigeal. Seedlings can become established from seeds that fall on a highly organic surface, such as forest litter. Because the seeds are so small, however, their food reserves are minimal and the tender radicle must encounter a moist, nutritious substrate almost immediately after germination if the seed is to become an established plant. Seedlings can tolerate partial shade for several years, but after that full sun is required for normal development. Red alder can be regenerated by any method that provides full sunlight and exposed mineral soil. The species is an aggressive pioneer on avalanche paths, road cuts, log landings, skid trails, or other areas where mineral soil has been freshly exposed to seed fall. Clearcutting and large-group selection are feasible regeneration systems. During harvesting or in a subsequent site preparation treatment, the site must be disturbed sufficiently to expose mineral soil. Fire can probably substitute for mechanical disturbance on most sites. To exclude red alder from the next rotation stand, some forest managers try to reduce the supply of alder seed by cutting possible alder seed trees in the vicinity before or at the time of final harvest, and also to avoid creating favorable seedbed conditions by disturbing the site as little as possible during logging and, if feasible, by not burning the logging slash. Artificial regeneration can be accomplished with either bare-root or containerized seedlings. Dried, stored seed need not be stratified (2,29). Nursery production of seedlings is fairly trouble free if standard techniques are used; sowing should generally be done fairly late (in June), however, to prevent the development of seedlings too large to be easily handled by planting crews. If the soil is sterilized, it may be necessary to reinoculate it to speed formation of mycorrhizae and root nodules. Guidelines for producing containerized seedlings are available (2), covering seed treatment, inoculation methods, and growth media. Survival and growth of planted seedlings are usually excellent. Height growth of red alder seedlings is exceptionally rapid. On favorable sites, seedlings can grow 1 m (3.3 ft) or more the first year and on all but the poorest sites, seedlings surpass breast height (1.37 m; 4.5 ft) the second year (16). Maximum annual height growth of more than 3 m (9.8 ft) a year can be achieved by 2- to 5-year-old seedlings (16). Seasonal growth of red alder is under strong climatic control and consequently quite variable. The timing of radial growth is similar for red alder and its common associate Douglas-fir; in the Puget Sound area of Washington State, growth Begins about midApril and continues until mid-September (32). Height growth begins slightly later in the season than radial growth. Red alder has indeterminate height growth; thus, height growth continues through the growing season until soil moisture, temperature, or light conditions become unfavorable. Vegetative Reproduction- Red alder sprouts vigorously from the stump when young. It can be repeatedly coppiced on short cycles but rootstock mortality increases with each harvest (17). Age, time of year, and cutting height influence the likelihood of obtaining stump sprouts and the vigor of the sprouts (15). Stumps will sprout best when trees are cut in the winter and when stump height exceeds 4 in (10 cm). Older trees rarely sprout and coppice regeneration cannot be expected after polesize or saw-log-size material is harvested (15). Greenwood cuttings from young trees can be readily rooted. More than 50 percent of cuttings from 1to 3-year-old plants took root within 6 weeks after treatment with 4,000 to 8,000 p/m indole-3-butyric acid and 10 percent benomyl (27). The cuttings were set in a well-aerated planting mix and placed in a warm environment (22° to 25° C; 72° to 77° F) in the daytime and 16° to 22° C (61° to 72° F) at night with high relative humidity and a 16-hour photoperiod. Cuttings of succulent new spring growth from shoots of 3- to 6-year-old trees and epicormic sprouts from 27- to 34-year-old trees have also been rooted successfully (30). Best results were obtained with a 10-second dip in 2,000 or 4,000 p/m indole-3-butyric acid. The extent of rooting and root vigor on the cuttings varied greatly among ortets and treatments. Red alder can also be propagated by mound layering (41). For this technique the seedlings are first coppiced. When the sprouts are a few months old, the stump and the base of the sprouts are covered with soil. The sprouts soon form roots; they can be severed from the stump and planted at the end of the first growing season.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Red Alder,alnus,rubra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Red alder has rapid juvenile growth; of its associates, only black cottonwood grows as much or more during the juvenile phase. On good sites, trees may be 9 in (30 ft) at age 5, 16 in (52 ft) at age 10, and 24 in (79 ft) at age 20. One tree was 9.8 in (32.1 ft) tall and 16.3 cm (6.4 in) in d.b.h. 5 years from seed (36). Mean annual production in 7to 12-year-old thickets has been estimated (oven-dry) at 15.4 t/ha (6.8 tons/acre) (5). Growth slows after the juvenile stage, the decrease beginning much sooner on poor sites. Site index as determined at base age 20 years ranges from 10 to 25 in (33 to 82 ft) (16); at base age 50, it ranges from 18 to 37 in (60 to 120 ft) (44). Associated conifers have much slower juvenile growth, but they sustain height growth years longer than alder. On an average site, both Douglas-fir and red alder can attain the same height at about age 45 (36). Beyond that age, Douglas-fir surpasses red alder in height. Red alder is a relatively short-lived species, maturing at about 60 to 70 years; maximum age is usually about 100 years (45). On favorable sites, trees can be 30 to 40 m (100 to 130 ft) tall and 55 to 75 cm (22 to 30 in) in diameter. A record-size tree measured 198 cm (78 in) in d.b.h., but trees over 90 cm (35 in) in diameter are rare. Maximum cubic volume is attained at age 50 to 70 (500 m'/ha or 7 ' 150 ft'/acre) (5,44). In pure stands on good sites, it has been estimated that red alder can achieve annual cubic volume growth rates of 21 m'/ha (300 ft'/acre) in pulpwood rotations of 10 to 12 years, and 14 m/ha (200 ft'/acre) in saw-log rotations of 30 to 32 years (5). Most of the existing alder volume is in mixed stands where growth and yield are variable. Rooting Habit- Red alder forms extensive, fibrous root systems. Root growth of seedlings is rapid; 2-year-old nursery-grown seedlings have to be planted using a shovel because of their wide-spreading, large, woody roots. Red alder roots are commonly ectomycorrhizal. Only a few species of fungi, however, are capable of forming ectomycorrhizal associations with alder. Fungal symbionts include an alder-specific fungus (Alpova diplophloeus) and fungi capable of mycorrhizal associations with other hosts (Paxillus inuolutus, Astraeus pteridis, and Scleroderma hypogaeum) (26). Red alder also has root nodules that fix atmospheric nitrogen. The nodules are a symbiotic association between the tree and an actinomycete (Frankia spp.). Nodulation occurs soon after seed germination; root systems of seedlings a few months old commonly have dozens of visible nodules, ranging from the size of a pinhead up to 25 min (1 in) in diameter. Mature trees have nodules on both the large woody roots and the smaller new roots. Nodules found on large trees can be as large as 80 or 90 mm (3.1 or 3.5 in) in diameter. Reaction to Competition- Red alder requires more light than any of its tree associates except black cottonwood and is classed as intolerant of shade. Young seedlings can withstand partial shade for a few years but will grow very little; if not released, the seedlings will die. The only trees that survive are those that maintain dominant or codominant crown positions. Self-thinning or mortality caused by competition is rapid, and mean densities in natural stands decrease from 124,000 seedlings per hectare (50,000/acre) at age 5 (7) to 1,665 seedlings per hectare (675/acre) at age 20 (44). Red alder also selfprunes extremely well. Shaded lower branches rapidly die and fall off; alder holes are typically clear and slightly tapered (fig. 3). Live crown ratios in crowded, pure stands are very low, and narrow, domelike crowns are characteristic. Early control of spacing is necessary to keep live crown ratios high enough to maintain good growth beyond the juvenile phase. Saw-log yields can be maximized on short rotations by combining early spacing control with pulpwood thinnings (5). Thinnings in previously unthinned stands are most effective in stimulating growth of residual trees if done before height growth slows-about age 15 to 20 (5,28,39). Thinning in older stands can salvage mortality and help maintain the vigor of residual trees but does not usually accelerate diameter growth (25,40). Epicormic branching has been reported after thinning, especially when thinning has been late or drastic (1,40). Epicormic sprouting is most commonly observed on the south side of stressed trees. Epicormic branches appearing after early thinning are usually ephemeral and not cause for concern. Red alder can be grown in either pure or mixed stands. Creation or maintenance of mixed stands requires careful attention to the respective heightgrowth patterns and tolerances of the species. Alder must be kept in the upper canopy to survive in mixed stands. Damaging Agents- Red alder is fairly free from most insect and disease problems, especially when young (age 40 or 50) and uninjured (21,45). Phellinus igniarius, a white heart rot, is probably the major cause of cull in older trees. Three canker-causing stem diseases-Didymosphaeria oregonensis, Hymenochaete agglutinans, and Nectria galligena-cause some damage, especially in young stands, but their overall impact is slight. Red alder has a number of foliage and catkin diseases, but none are economically important. Many species of fungi have been identified on alder; but, except for those discussed above, they tend to be secondary invaders on dead or dying tissue. Wood stain and decay proceed rapidly in cut trees, and logs should be processed soon after harvest unless they are stored in fresh water (43). During intermediate cuts, care must be taken to avoid injuring residual trees; once trees are injured, decay organisms can invade rapidly. Insect pests are not usually a major concern, but serious outbreaks of some defoliators can cause growth reductions. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), western tent caterpillar (M. californicum), alder woolly sawfly (Eriocampa ovata), striped alder sawfly (Hemichroa crocea), the alder flea beetle (Altica ambiens), and a leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta punctipennis) have caused substantial damage; but reports of mortality are rare (5,13,45). A flatheaded wood borer (Agrilus burkei) can kill twigs and branches (5,13). The alder bark beetle (Alniphagus aspericollis) breeds primarily in slash and in young stressed trees; however, healthy trees can be attacked when bark beetle populations are high (5). Ambrosia beetles (Gnathotrichus retusus, 7~-ypodendron lineatum, Xyleborus saxeseni) attack logs and slash left on the ground, causing rapid degrade in quality. Insect holes can also serve as entry sites for fungi. Merchantable material should be removed rapidly, and large accumulations of slash should be avoided. Animals cause only minor damage in alder stands. Young trees are occasionally browsed by black-tailed deer, especially during the late summer and fall (6), but alder is not a preferred species. 'Mountain beaver sometimes girdle small stems and branches; their use of alder foliage for food is minor and sporadic except in late September when use is fairly heavy (38). In years of high populations, meadow mice girdle young stems. Damage by meadow mice has been most commonly observed in grassy or very wet areas. Climatic factors can damage red alder. Mortality and top damage have been documented in natural stands after ice storms or unseasonable frosts (10,45). Fire is rarely a damaging agent because of the scarcity of flammable debris in alder stands; in fact, the species sometimes has been planted as a firebreak to protect adjacent conifers (45). Alder bark is thin but sufficiently fire resistant to prevent damage during light surface fires (43). Windthrow is not common in alder because of the intermingling of roots and branches, the absence of leaves during winter storms when soils can be waterlogged, and the relatively deep-rooting habit of the species on well-drained soils. Uprooted trees are most commonly observed along cutting boundaries or where established root systems have been undercut by flooding or erosion.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Red Alder,alnus,rubra,hardwood,14,0
"Red alder is found on a wide range of soils, from well-drained gravels or sands to poorly drained clays or organic soils. It grows primarily on soils of the orders Inceptisols and Entisols but is also found on some Alfisols, Ultisols, and Histosols. Best stands are found on deep, well-drained loams or sandy loams of alluvial origin; however, some excellent stands are also found on residual or colluvial soils derived from volcanic materials. Soil moisture during the growing season appears to influence where the species grows. Alder can tolerate poor drainage conditions and some flooding during the growing season; consequently, it prevails on soils where drainage is restricted-along stream bottoms or in swamps or marshes. It is not commonly found on droughty soils, however; and in areas of low precipitation, it seldom grows on steep south or southwest-facing slopes. In Idaho and California, stands are usually limited to borders of streams or lakes. Red alder develops best on elevations below 450 in (1,480 ft) in northern Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. In Alaska, red alder generally occurs close to sea level. Farther south, scattered trees are found as high as 1100 in (3,610 ft), but most stands are at elevations below 750 in (2,460 ft).",Soils and Topography,Red Alder,alnus,rubra,hardwood,15,0
"Red alder wood is diffuse-porous, moderately dense, and uniformly textured. It is used in the production of solid wood products, such as furniture, cabinets, case goods, pallets, and novelties (31); composite products, including plywood and flakeboard (5); and fiberbased products, such as tissues and writing paper. Alder is a common fuelwood and is burned both in home fireplaces and stoves, and in mills that use residues to produce heat for drying and other processes (31). Because of its rapid juvenile growth and ability to coppice, red alder has been evaluated for use in biomass farms for energy conversion (5); some experimental plantings have been made to evaluate yields under intensive management. The ability of red alder to fix atmospheric nitrogen can result in increases in both nitrogen content and its availability in the soil. Nitrogen fixed irr the nodules is added to the soil in four ways: direct excretion from living roots or nodules, decomposition of dead roots or nodules, leaching from foliage, and decomposition of litter rich in nitrogen. Fixation rates vary diurnally and seasonally (37) and with site and stand age (3,36). Maximum annual fixation rates of 320 kg/ha (290 lb/acre) (36, based on accretion) in pure stands and 130 kg/ha (120 lb/acre)(3, based on acetylene reduction assays) in mixed stands have been reported. Red alder also increases the organic matter content in the soil (34,36). Concomitant with increases in soil organic matter, decreases in soil bulk density and pH have been reported (4,34,36). Red alder has been proposed for use alone and in both crop rotation and mixture with other species (8). Because of its ability to add nitrogen and organic matter to a site and its rapid juvenile growth on a variety of sites, the species has been experimentally planted as follows: (a) to serve as a nitrogen source for other species (particularly Douglas-fir and black cottonwood) (5,9); (b) on coal mine spoils, landslides, and other eroded or low fertility areas (20,35); (c) for streambank or roadside protection; (d) in areas of poor drainage; (e) as a firebreak or windbreak (5,34); and M for wildlife areas. An additional experimental use of red alder in a crop rotation system is to plant it in areas containing coniferous root pathogens, such as Phellinus weiri, which can survive for many years in organic materials in the soil (14). The only known control is to replace the disease-susceptible species with a nonsusceptible species for 40 to 50 years. Red alder is a good candidate for such an interim species. Other experimental uses of alder include addition of foliage, twigs, and sawdust to grain or alfalfa for cattle feed and addition of sawdust to nursery soils to increase organic matter.",Special Uses,Red Alder,alnus,rubra,hardwood,16,0
"Red maple is a major or an associated species in 56 of the 88 nontropical forest cover types recognized for the eastern United States (13). Red maple forms a pure cover type (Society of American Foresters Type 108) because it makes up at least 80 percent of the stand basal area. The species is also at least 20 percent of Gray Birch-Red Maple (Type 19), White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple (Type 20), Black Cherry-Maple (Type 28), and Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39). The red maple is most common in New England, Middle Atlantic States, upper Michigan, and northeast Wisconsin. It is rare farther west and south. Recognition of red maple as a separate cover type generally is attributed to disturbances that allowed red maple residuals to respond rapidly. The elimination of elm (Ulmus americana and U. thomasii) by Dutch elm disease and of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) by the blight, and selective removal of yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) have contributed to increasing the proportion of red maple stocking in many stands (13,40,48). Throughout its range, red maple is associated with more than 70 different commercial tree species (26). Its more common associates from the north to the south include red spruce (Picea rubens), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white pine (Pinus strobus), sugar maple, beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow birch, paper birch (Betula papyrifera), gray birch (B. populifolia), sweet birch (B. lenta), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. tremuloides), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica), black cherry (P serotina), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), American elm, chestnut oak (Q. prinus), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) (13).",Associated Forest Cover,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,1,0
"The northern extent of the red maple range coincides with the -40°C (-40° F) mean minimum isotherm in southeastern Canada (11). The western range is limited by the dry climate of the Prairie States. Of all the maples, it has the widest tolerance to climatic conditions. The absence of red maple in the Prairie Peninsula does not seem to be related to precipitation amount because the tree grows elsewhere with similar or less annual precipitation.",Climate,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,2,0
"As might be expected from its wide range, red maple shows great variation in height, cold hardiness, straightness, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. In general, red maples in the north show the most reddish autumn color, earliest flushing and bud set, and least winter injury. Seeds from the north-central and east-central range produce the tallest seedlings. Genetic potential has been found for breeding and selecting red maple against three major urban stresses: verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought (52,53). Red maple fruits also exhibit geographical variation. The more northerly sources, from locations with short frost-free periods, produced samaras that are shorter but heavier than those from southern sources (51,66). Experimental crosses of red and silver maple have been made (26). Also, red maple is known to hybridize naturally with silver maple (33).",Genetics,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,7,0
"Red maple is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern North America (26). It grows from southern Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and southern Quebec to southern and southwestern Ontario, extreme southeastern Manitoba, and northern Minnesota; south to Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, eastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas; and east to Florida (33). It has the greatest continuous range along the Atlantic Coast of any tree found in Florida-an extent of 2575 km (1,600 mi) (32). The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the 95th meridian, with three exceptions: Prairie Peninsula proper of the Midwest, the coastal prairie of southern Louisiana and southeastern Texas, and the swamp prairie of the Florida Everglades. The most notable exception is the Prairie Peninsula, where red maple is absent from the bottom land forests of the Corn Belt, though it grows abundantly in similar situations and species associations both to the north and south of the Peninsula (54). - The native range of red maple.",Native Range,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting-Red maple is one of the first trees to flower in the spring, generally several weeks before vegetative bud break. The flowers are small, with slender stalks, red or rarely yellowish, with petals; they appear from March to May depending upon elevation and latitude. Trees can flower and bear seed at an early age; 4-year-old trees have produced seed. Flowering occurs on all branches in the well-lit upper portion of the crown. Characteristically, the nonflowering branches are slow growing and lack vigor. Red maple flowers are structurally perfect. The species is polygamo-dioecious. Thus, some trees are entirely male, producing no seeds; some are entirely female; and some are monoecious, bearing both male and female flowers. On monoecious trees, functioning male and female flowers usually are separated on different branches. Sex of the flower is not a function of tree vigor. The species shows a tendency toward dioeciousness rather than toward dichogamy (59,64,67). Seed Production and Dissemination- A seed crop occurs almost every year, and on an average, a good to bumper crop occurs once in every 2 years (14). Red maple is generally very fruitful. Trees 5 to 20 cm in d.b.h. (2 to 8 in) can yield seed crops of 12,000 to 91,000 seeds. A 30-cm (12-in) tree yielded nearly a million seeds (1). It is possible to stimulate red maple seed production through fertilization. The stimulation often lasts 2 years and may yield up to 10 times more seeds than an unfertilized stand (4). The fruit, a double samara, ripens from April to June before leaf development is complete. After ripening, seeds are dispersed for a 1- to 2-week period during April through July. The seed does not require pregermination treatment and can germinate immediately after ripening. The fruits are among the lightest of the maple fruits, averaging about 51,000 cleaned seeds per kilogram (23,OOOflb). In general, fruits are heavier in northern latitudes. Red maple fruit from Canada, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where the normal growing season is 80 to 150 days, averaged 23 gr (1.5 g)/100 fruits. On the other hand, in Rhode Island, Kentucky, and South Carolina, with a frost-free period of 180 to 240 days, the weight averaged 17 gr (1.1 g)/100 fruits. Because the fruits are small and winged, they disperse efficiently in the wind. Germination may be 75 to 80 percent in 2 to 6 days. Total germination is often 85 to 91 percent (59,66). Seedling Development- Red maple has few germination requirements. The seed can germinate with very little light (26), given proper temperature and some moisture. Most seeds generally germinate in the early summer soon after dispersal. Shading by a dense overstory canopy can depress first-year germination; then second-year germination is common (36). Germination is epigeal (59). Moist mineral soil seems the best seedbed for red maple, and a thin layer of hardwood leaf litter does not hinder germination and early survival. Many red maple seeds germinate each year in abandoned old fields, in cutover areas and burns, and in the forest. Reproduction has also been observed on strip-mine Spoil banks in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio (26). Not many new seedlings can survive under a closed forest canopy, but enough do survive to perpetuate the species in abundance. Presently, red maple is important in many stands where it was formerly a limited associate; it is enabled to increase by disturbances such as disease, windthrow, fire, and harvesting (5,15,19,3740). In southeastern Ohio, 6 years after clearcutting a 3.4 ha (8.5 acre) mature oak-hickory stand, the new stand contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900/acre) taller than 1.4 m (4.5 ft), together with many yellow-poplar and oak seedlings (Unpub. data, Vinton Furnace Experimental Forest, McArthur, OH). The original stand on the plot contained no red maple. There were occasional red maples in nearby stands. Red maple does not show a strong affinity for either northern or southern exposures (48), but its best growth form is often found on northeast slopes (40). The young seedlings are shade tolerant, and abundant 1- to 4-year-old seedlings are often found under the canopy of older stands. Many of these seedlings die each year if they are not released by opening of the main crown canopy, but new ones replace them. Thus, a reservoir of seedlings and ungerminated seed is available to respond to increased sunlight resulting from disturbance. Pre-existing red maples in a cut stand add greatly to the new stand stocking through stump sprouts (21). In some species, disturbances of small areas often restrict development of new age classes because the canopy over small areas closes in from the side too quickly. Red maple, however, is sufficiently shade tolerant to respond and may increase in prominence after small disturbances (20,37). Red maple shows an early tendency to develop root system characteristics according to soil conditions, enabling it to grow on greatly different sites ranging from swamp to dry upland (62). On wet sites, red maple seedlings produce short taproots with long, well-developed laterals. On dry sites, they develop long taproots with much shorter laterals (26). Red maple seedlings are classified as moderately tolerant of soil saturation. In one study, their growth was only slightly retarded after 60 days in saturated soils (24). Red maple seedlings were very tolerant of flooding, showing no sign of stem or leaf damage after 60 days of flooding (7). This capacity to withstand conditions of wetness or dryness enables survival and growth on a wide variety of site conditions where red maple grows naturally. Throughout the northern portion of its range, with respect to shade, red maple seedlings are rated moderately tolerant to tolerant and are often abundant in the understory advance reproduction. In the Piedmont, red maple seedlings were found to be shade intolerant however; and, in the lower Mississippi Basin, red maple seedlings grow well only in openings. The species was found to be more shade tolerant on good sites than on poor sites. Overall, it ranks more shade tolerant than yellow birch or white ash (Fraxinus americana) but less so than sugar maple, American beech, or eastern hophornbeam (26). Sugar maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation in the spring, and red maple starts only a few days later. In one study, red maple stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week. Growth then slowed and was 90 percent completed in 54 days (27). Under favorable light and moisture, red maple seedlings can grow 0.3 m (1 ft) the first year and as much as 0.6 m (2 ft) each year for the next few years. Some sprouts can grow 0.9 m (3 ft) or more the first year (26), but they soon slow to about the same rate as seedlings. Although red maple naturally germinates and becomes established on many types of seedbeds, direct seeding in an old field failed. Survival was only 37 percent after the first year (2). Planting of seedlings has not succeeded on strip-mine spoil banks (26) or old fields (45). First year survival generally is low and survivors may show poor growth rate and form. Planted red maple infected with mycorrhizae may grow somewhat better, especially on strip-mine spoil banks (10). In the nursery, red maple seedling growth was increased when 4 hours of supplemental light and an aluminum foil soil mulch were provided, and when the soil was treated with the insecticide Disulfoton. In 1 year, these seedlings compared favorably with 2- to 3-year-old seedlings grown by conventional methods (8). If planting of red maple is desired, container-grown stock seems to offer some promise. Ninety-eight percent of the red maple tubelings planted in a New Hampshire forest clearcutting during August survived. The stock had been grown for 8 weeks in containers. Two container sizes-41 cm³ (2.5 in³) and 125 cm³ (7.6 in³) were compared, with no difference in results (17). Red maple is a common associate in second-growth cherry-maple Allegheny hardwood stands. But after clearcutting, red maple seedlings often grow poorly, whereas the black cherry seedlings do well. A chemical from black cherry, perhaps benzoic acid, may interfere with red maple development (22). Black cherry leaves have been identified as a source of benzoic acid and as a potential allelopathic inhibitor of red maple (23). Vegetative Reproduction- Red maple stumps sprout vigorously. Inhibited, dormant buds are always present at the base of red maple stems. Within 2 to 6 weeks after the stem is cut, these inhibited buds begin to extend (65). Fire can also stimulate these buds. The number of sprouts per stump increases with stump diameter to a maximum of 23 to 30 cm (9 to 12 in), and then decreases among larger trees. Stumps of younger trees tend to produce taller sprouts (39,47). Sprouts grow faster than seedlings, and leaf and internode size is greater. As competition increases, growth rates slow (65). Many of the sprouts have rot and poor form (58). Also, the attachment of a sprout to the stump is often weak because the base of the sprout grows over the stump bark and the vascular connection between them is constricted (65). Regeneration by seedling sprout may be especially successful (19). Generally, the species' great sprouting capacity makes it suitable for coppicing and accounts for its tendency to be found in sprout clumps. Red maple is difficult to propagate from cuttings and success varies considerably. Some rooting has been obtained by treating cuttings with a concentration of 200 mg per liter (200 p/m) of indolebutyric acid for 3 hours. Cuttings collected in June seem to root better than those taken later in the growing season. Cuttings from the lower part of the crown root better than those from the upper part, and cuttings from male clones or female clones, which fruit sparingly, root better. Successful bud grafting on an experimental basis has been reported with red maple and with sugar maple on red maple stocks, and layering has been observed in central Pennsylvania. For the most part, however, the species is difficult to propagate vegetatively, except by means of stump sprouts (26).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Red maple is a short- to medium-lived tree and seldom lives longer than 150 years. It reaches maturity in 70 to 80 years. Average mature trees are 18 to 27 m (60 to 90 ft) in height and 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in) in diameter (26). The largest registered living red maple is growing near Armada, MI. It is 38.1 m (125 ft) tall and has a bole circumference, at breast height, of 4.95 m (16.25 ft) (38). Although red maple height growth starts relatively early in the spring, radial growth starts late in the season. Radial growth then proceeds rapidly, becoming half complete in 50 to 59 days and fully complete in 70 to 79 days. In a New York study, red maple total height growth was somewhat better than that of the other species studied (26). Growth during early life is rapid but slows after trees pass the pole stage. Red maple responds well to thinning. In upper Michigan, thinning was more effective than fertilization for stimulating red maple growth (49). In the Canadian Maritimes, a 35-year-old coppice red maple stand was thinned by reducing each sprout clump to one of the better stems. The number of red maple stems was reduced from 2,610 to 560/ha (1,057 to 227/acre). Ten years later, these residual trees had more than doubled their volume to 63.8 m³/ha (911 ft³/acre). In another study, a partial cutting was made on a 40-year-old stand of Allegheny northern hardwoods. Of all the species, red maple grew best. In the 10-year period after cutting, dominant red maple trees grew an average of 5.7 cm (2.25 in) in diameter. In the north, the young red maple trees grow faster than sugar maple, beech, or yellow birch, but slower than aspen, paper birch, or white ash. In southern bottom lands, the growth rate of red maple compares favorably with that of other hardwood species. An average diameter growth of 7.5 to 9 cm (3.0 to 3.5 in) in 10 years is possible (26). Early crop tree release of red maple seedlings and sprouts is feasible in young, even-aged stands. It should be done when the new stand has crown closure and crown dominance is being expressed. This occurred on 9- to 12-year-old trees in West Virginia (56,57). Only 10 percent of red maple sprout clumps did not have a sprout of potential crop tree quality (29). Released red maple trees have a low susceptibility to epicormic sprouting (46). Rooting Habit- Red maple trees grow well and are generally capable of growing as well as or better than their associates on sites with less than optimum moisture conditions, either too wet or too dry. In Michigan, red maple sprouts grew about twice as fast on wet organic soils as on mineral soils or drier organic soils (26). Roots of maple seedlings are capable of developing differently in response to various environments, so that the seedlings can survive in situations ranging from swamp to dry upland. This characteristic root system adaptability is maintained as the trees grow older. Under flood conditions, many adventitious roots develop, but the root systems recover quickly upon drainage (24). Red maples seem to tolerate drought through their readiness to stop growing under dry conditions (52) and by producing a second growth flush when conditions improve again, even after growth has stopped for 2 weeks (27). Red maple roots are primarily horizontal and form in the upper 25 cm (10 in) of soil. After germination, a taproot develops until it is about 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) long, then it turns and grows horizontally. As the woody roots extend sideways, nonwoody fans of feeder roots extend upward, mostly within the upper 8 cm (3 in) of mineral soil. The woody roots may be 25 m (80 ft) long (34). Although red maple trees and seedlings tolerate flooding, they can be damaged if silt and sand layers 7.6 cm (3 in) or more are deposited over their roots (6). Reaction to Competition- Red maple is a pioneer or subclimax species that is more shade tolerant and longer lived than the usual early successional species, such as poplar (aspen) and pin cherry. It compares in shade tolerance with sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), silver maple, American basswood (Tilia americana), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), black gum, and rock elm (Ulmus thomasii). It is not as tolerant as sugar maple, American beech, eastern hophornbeam, and flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) (26). Red maple can most accurately be classed as tolerant of shade. Seedlings are more shade tolerant than larger trees and can exist in the understory for several years. They respond rapidly to release and can occupy over-story space. Disturbances such as fire, disease, hurricanes, and harvesting have caused red maple to increase in stocking where it previously occurred as only scattered trees (19,31,35,40,48,55). As these stands mature and the canopy closes, red maple growth slows due to competition for light (9). Following a hurricane in central New England, the site was soon dominated by pin cherry, with red maple, northern red oak, paper birch, and a few eastern white pine. After 10 years, the pin cherry was giving way to dominance by red maple. After 40 years, however, northern red oak and paper birch had assumed dominance over the now codominant red maple (19). In northern hardwood types, red maple begins to give way to sugar maple and more tolerant hardwoods after about 80 years (26), but on certain wet sites, red maple can probably maintain itself indefinitely as an edaphic climax (13). Red maple is generally very resistant to herbicides (28). Also, diffuse porous species such as red maple are difficult to kill by girdling. For example, 3 years after treatment, 70 percent of the girdled trees had live crowns (63). Stem injection, using cacodylic acid(12) and picloram (61), did successfully control red maple as did glyphosate applied by hydraulic sprayer; but not when applied by a mist blower (16). Generally, if treatment of red maple is planned, it is wise to consult current labels or experts in the field of chemical control to determine the latest allowable chemicals and the best methods of application. Damaging Agents- Red maple is generally considered very susceptible to defect. Especially on poor sites, red maple often has poor form and considerable internal defect. Discoloration and decay advance much faster in red maple than in sugar maple (43). In northeastern Pennsylvania, average cull ranged from 13 percent in 30 cm (12 in) diameter red maple trees to 46 percent in 61 cm (24 in) diameter trees. Only associated beech and black birch were more defective (26). Sprout clumps present some serious problems. More defects originate from branch stubs on the sprout stems than from the parent stump (43). Inonotus glomeratus can infect branch stubs and wounds above the butt in red maple. Nevertheless, a red maple sprout with only a slightly defective base and small and well-healed branch stubs has a potential for high future value. Criteria for selecting red maple sprouts for thinning are (1) select only stems with small, well-healed branch stubs, (2) reject sprout clumps with defective bases, and (3) cut all but one or two of the best dominant stem sprouts (50). Many trunk rot fungi and stem diseases attack red maple. Inonotus glomeratus infects branch stubs and wounds on the stem and is most important. Second in importance is Oxyporus populinus, which forms a small, white fruit body that often has moss growing on top. Phellinus igniarius is another leading heart rot of red maple. Red maple may also be cankered by species of Nectria, Eutypella, Hypoxylon, Schizoxylon, Strumella, and others (48). Red maple is susceptible to many leaf diseases, generally of minor importance. It is seldom or seriously damaged by root diseases, although Armillana mellea can enter through root or butt wounds. However, A. mellea kills only trees already weakened from other causes (18). Mechanical injury is a common source of defect in hardwoods, and red maple is especially sensitive to wounding. Often, large areas of cambium surrounding the wound will die back. In shade tree maintenance, wound dressings have not proven effective in stimulating wound closure or internal compartmentalization of the damaged area (44). Increment boring causes discoloration and may lead to decay in red maple. Callus growth, when established, is reasonably rapid, but an extra year or two often is needed if cambial dieback has been extensive around the wound (26). Red maple was rated intermediate with respect to amount of damage after a severe glaze storm in Pennsylvania. In one study, major damage was sustained by 41 percent of the black cherry, 16 percent of the red maple, and 5 percent of the hemlock (18). Many different insects feed on red maple, but probably none of them kill healthy trees. They do reduce vigor and growth leaving the tree more susceptible to attack from fungi. Insect feeding also may hasten the death of weakened trees. Susceptibility to insect attack is illustrated by a study in the Piedmont. Of 40 species investigated, red maple had the highest percentage (79 percent) of insect attacks. Among the more important borers attacking red maple were the gallmaking maple borer (Xylotreehus aceris), the maple callus borer (Synanthedon acerni), and the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus). The common scale insects included the cottony maple scale (Pulvinaria vitis), the maple leaf scale (P acericola), and the oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi). The common leaf feeding moths were the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the linden looper (Erannis tiliaria), the elm spanworm (Ennomos subsignaria), and the red maple spanworm (Itame pustularia). The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) avoids red maple, however (26). Red maple is very sensitive to fire injury, and even large trees can be killed by a fire of moderate intensity. The fire-killed trees sprout vigorously, however, and red maple may become a more important stand component after a fire than before one (26). Red maple is a desirable deer food and reproduction may be almost completely suppressed in areas of excessive deer populations. Snowshoe hares may also reduce the amount of red maple reproduction (26). If sapsuckers attack red maple, ringshake may develop (42). Sapsucker damage may also result in mortality Healthy as well as unhealthy trees are attacked and nearly 40 percent of the trees attacked may be killed (41).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,14,0
"Red maple can probably thrive on a wider range of soil types, textures, moisture, pH, and elevation than any other forest species in North America (18). Its range covers soils of the following orders: Entisols, Inceptisols, Ultisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, and Histosols. It grows on both glaciated and nonglaciated soils derived from granite, gneisses, schists, sandstone, shales, slates, conglomerates, quartzites, and limestone (26). Red maple grows on diverse sites, from dry ridges and southwest slopes to peat bogs and swamps. It commonly grows under the more extreme soil-moisture conditions either very wet or quite dry. The species does not show a strong affinity for either a north or a south aspect (48). Although it develops best on moderately well-drained, moist sites at low to intermediate elevations, it is common in mountainous country on the drier ridges and on south and west exposures of upper slopes. It is also common, however, in swampy areas, on slow-draining flats and depressions, and along small sluggish streams (26). In upper Michigan and New England, red maple grows on ridge tops and dry sandy or rocky upland soils and in almost pure stands on moist soils and swamp borders (13,40). In the extreme south, red maple is almost exclusively a swamp species.",Soils and Topography,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,15,0
"Red maple is known in the lumber industry as soft maple. The wood is close grained and resembles sugar maple but is softer in texture, not as heavy, lacks the figure, and has somewhat poorer machining qualities. Red maple in the better grades is substituted for hard maple, particularly for furniture. Red maple lumber shrinkage from green to oven-dry moisture content is slightly more than shrinkage for hard maple in radial, tangential, and volumetric measurements (60). Brilliant fall coloring is one of the outstanding features of red maple. In the northern forest, its bright red foliage is a striking contrast against the dark green conifers and the white bark and yellow foliage of the paper birches. Red maple is widely used as a landscape tree. Although the hard maples-sugar and black maple (Acer nigrum) are principally used for syrup production, red maple is also suitable. When sap and syrup from sugar maple were compared with those of red and silver maple, boxelder (A. negundo), and Norway maple (A. platanoides), they were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality (30). The buds of red and silver maple and boxelder break dormancy much earlier in the spring than sugar maple, however, and the chemical content of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. Consequently, the tapping season for red and silver maple is shorter than that for sugar maple. Red maple is a highly desirable wildlife browse food. Elk and white-tailed deer especially use the current season's growth of red maple and aspen as an important source of winter food(25). Timber harvesting slash can provide an important source of browse to help sustain the animals. Red maple, sugar maple, and paper birch trees cut any time after leaf fall provide browse as nutritious as, and more acceptable than, trees cut immediately before leaf fall (3).",Special Uses,Red Maple,acer,rubrum,hardwood,16,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Red mulberry is dioecious but can be monoecious, with male and female flowers on different branches of the same plants. Both male and female flowers are stalked axillary pendulous catkins and appear in April and May. The blackberry-like fruit reaches full development from June to August. Each fruit is composed of many small drupelets which develop from separate female flowers ripening together (8). Seed Production and Dissemination- Minimum seed-bearing age is usually about 10 years, but 1-year-old trees planted in an abandoned field in east Texas produced fruits at age 4 (3). Optimum seedbearing age is 30 to 85 years; the maximum is 125 years. Good seed crops occur every 2 to 3 years (2). The average number of red mulberry fruits per kilogram is about 8,600 (3,900/lb); the average number of cleaned seeds per kilogram is 795,000 (360,000/lb). One hundred kilograms (220 lb) of fresh fruit yield 2 to 3 kg (4 to 7 lb) of cleaned seeds (8). Fruits that mature fall to the ground near the seed tree. However, because this relatively large, sweet fruit is a favorite food of most birds and some small animals, most of the fruits are eaten and dispersed by wildlife before they fully mature (6). Seedling Development- Seeds can be extracted from fresh fruits by mashing and soaking them in water, and then passing them through a macerator, where pulp and empty seeds are skimmed or floated off. Storage temperatures of -23° to -18° C (-10° to 0° F) are recommended for dry mulberry seeds (8). Seeds can be sown in fall without stratification or in spring following 30 to 90 days of stratification at 1° to 5° C (33° to 41° F) in moist sand. In nursery practice, seeds are sown in drills at the rate of 160 to 260/m (50 to 80/ft) in rows 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in) apart. Germination, which is epigeal, usually is from 12 to 50 percent. One-year bare-rooted seedlings may be outplanted (8). Vegetative Reproduction- Red mulberry can be propagated from stem cuttings or by budding, but these methods are complex and require greenhouse facilities. The average rooting from stem cuttings taken in May, September, and January was only 7 percent, regardless of time of year (2). Red mulberry is a prolific root sprouter and can be reproduced by layering.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Red Mulberry,morus,rubra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Red mulberry is usually found as scattered individuals near streams or in other moist places. Stands of any size are not mentioned in the literature. Very little is known about the growth and development of this species. At maturity, red mulberry trees are an average of 5 to 21 in (15 to 70 ft) tall and as large as 76 in (30 in) in d.b.h., depending upon habitat conditions. In wooded areas, red mulberry is often an understory tree with a rounded, spreading crown. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Red mulberry has been planted in the Midwest because its fruits are a valuable food for wildlife, but because it provides very little soil stability or cover for wildlife, it has not been planted widely (8). It grows best in open conditions (3) but is classed as tolerant of shade as it often grows as an understory tree. Damaging Agents- Red mulberry seems to be vanishing from at least a portion of its central range, possibly due to a bacterial disease. The effects and extent of this disease have not been investigated thoroughly, but it is known that red mulberry trees are becoming increasingly scarce (2). The only noteworthy leaf pathogens of red mulberry reported in the United States are leaf spots caused by a species of Cercospora, Mycosphaerella mori, and Pseudomonas mori (4). Red mulberry also is susceptible to witches' broom, Microstroma juglandis, but the cause is unknown. A variety of insects feed on red mulberry leaves, including the European fruit lecanium, Parthenolecanium corni; Comstock mealybug, Pseudococcus comstocki; and cottony maple scale, Pulvinaria innumerabilis. The American plum borer, Euzophera semifuneralis, and the mulberry borer, Doraschema wildii, attack twigs and stems of red mulberry (5). Red mulberry has been rated as moderately tolerant of flooding as it usually withstands being inundated with up to a foot of water for a single growing season. It normally succumbs, however, after being flooded for two growing seasons (1).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Red Mulberry,morus,rubra,hardwood,14,0
"Red mulberry grows on a variety of moist soils at elevations below 600 m (2,000 ft). Soil orders on which red mulberry is found include Alfisols, Inceptisols, Spodosols, and Ultisols. Seeds are carried great distances by birds so trees may be found on any soil that is not too dry. Best development is on well-drained, moist soils of sheltered coves along streams (7).",Soils and Topography,Red Mulberry,morus,rubra,hardwood,15,0
"The highest use of red mulberry is for its large, sweet fruits. These are a favored food of most birds and a number of small mammals including opossum, raccoon, fox squirrels, and gray squirrels. The fruits also are used in jellies, jams, pies, and drinks. In the past, the fruits were valued for fattening hogs and as poultry food. Red mulberry is used locally for fenceposts because the heartwood is relatively durable. Other uses of the wood include farm implements, cooperage, furniture, interior finish, and caskets (7).",Special Uses,Red Mulberry,morus,rubra,hardwood,16,0
"In parts of the northern Lake States, Ontario, and Quebec, red pine grows in extensive pure stands and in the Northeast and eastern Canada in small pure stands. More often it is found with jack pine (Pinus banksiana), eastern white pine (P. strobus), or both. It is a common component in three forest cover types: Red Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 15), Jack Pine (Type 1), and Eastern White Pine (Type 21) and is an occasional associate in one, Northern Pin Oak (Type 14) (26,90). On the coarser, drier soils, common associates of red pine are jack pine, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), bigtooth aspen (P. grandidentata), scrubby oaks (chiefly northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis)), and bear oak (Q. ilicifolia). On somewhat better soils (fine sands to loamy sands), in addition to the foregoing, associates may be eastern white pine, red maple (Acer rubrum), black cherry (Prunus serotina), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Q. alba), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black spruce (Picea mariana), and occasional specimens of the better hardwoods. On sandy loam and loam soils, red pine's associates include sugar maple (Acer saccharum), eastern white pine, American basswood (Tilia americana), red maple, balsam fir, paper birch (Betula papyrifera), yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), northern red oak, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), white spruce (Picea glauca), white ash (Fraxinus americana), red spruce (Picea rubens), northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), and eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana). Growing with red pine in the West Virginia outlier are eastern white pine, pitch pine (Pinus rigida), Virginia pine (P. virginiana), table mountain pine (P. pungens), sweet birch (Betula lenta), northern red oak and bear oak. In northeastern Illinois the woody plant associates include northern red oak, white oak, American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and roundleaf serviceberry (Amelanchier sanguinea). All the associates of red pine grow only as understory except eastern white pine and occasionally jack pine or aspen. When found with hardwoods, red pine usually is a minor but dominant component of the stand (76,87). The most common shrubs associated with red pine include Canada blueberry (Vaccinium canadense), low sweet blueberry (V. angustifolium), sweetfern (Comptonia peregrina), common bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), prairie willow (Salix humilis), American hazel (Corylus americana), beaked hazel (C. cornuta), striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (Diervilla lonicera), New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), sand cherry (Prunus pumila and P. susquehanae), fly honeysuckle (Lonicera canadensis), serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), raspberries (Rubus spp.), trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens), and spireas (Spiraea spp.) (26,76,87).",Associated Forest Cover,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,1,1
"Red pine is native to areas with cool-to-warm summers, cold winters, and low to moderate precipitation. Within red pine's natural range the average January temperatures vary from -18° to -4° C (0° to 25° F) and the average July temperatures from 16° to 21° C (60° to 70° F). Average annual maximum temperatures range from 32° to 38° C (90° to 100° F), and average annual minimum temperatures range from -23° to -40° C (-10° to -40° F). Average annual precipitation is from 510 to 1010 mm (20 to 40 in) throughout much of the range but reaches 1520 mm (60 in) in some eastern localities. The average growing season precipitation ranges from 380 to 640 mm (15 to 25 in), and the average annual snowfall ranges from 100 to 300 cm (40 to 120 in). Summer droughts of 30 or more days occur commonly in the western half of the range. The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 160 days, although it may be as short as 40 days northeast of Lake Superior in Ontario. The northern limit of red pine is related to length of frost-free period and closely parallels the 2° C (35° F) mean annual isotherm.",Climate,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,2,1
"Red pine is uniform morphologically and apparently very old. Fossil records from Dakota sandstone show that an upland pine (Pinus clementsii or P. resinosipites or both) markedly resembling red pine occurred in southern Minnesota during the Cretaceous period. During periods of glaciation, red pine was forced to migrate to the south and then returned north with the retreat of the glaciers. Indications are that after the most recent glaciation red pine migrated west, principally north of Lake Michigan, from a refuge in the Appalachian Highlands (76,103).",Genetics,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,7,1
"No authenticated interspecific hybrids involving red pine have been found in nature. A Pinus nigra var. austriaca x P. resinosa cross previously reported no longer is considered a valid red pine hybrid. Many additional hybridization attempts in the United States and Canada have failed, although one cross with Austrian pine and one with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) using highly irradiated (200 000 R) red pine pollen have been reported from Ontario. One tree of each cross survived at age 10. The trees were about 1 m (3 to 4 ft) tall, and each showed some hybrid characteristics (105). The growth rate of hybrids between provenances was intermediate between those of the parent provenances and showed no evidence of heterosis. The best opportunity for genetically improving red pine, therefore, is to incorporate small genetic gains in large numbers of seedlings when red pine is a major part of large-scale reforestation programs (28,42,47,62,90,104).",Hybrids,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,9,1
"Seed source studies have disclosed small, but statistically significant differences among provenance means for survival, phenological traits, size and growth rates, photoperiodic response, lammas frequency, and wood quality. For plantations up to age 20, the difference between the overall mean and the mean of the best provenance has been about 10 percent for height growth. Very young seedlings have shown greater differences and older trees less. Red pine from the Angus, ON, area has shown enough promise to be used for establishing seed orchards in Ontario and adjacent areas. Some effects of climate noted for red pine indicate that northern sources may have smaller seeds, seedlings with fewer cotyledons, lower frequency of lammas growth, and less frost sensitivity. Provenances from different climatic regions have shown differences in height growth and several other attributes, but variation between provenances within climatic regions is also present. In general, red pine traits show broad regional adaptation and broad regional differences as well as random occurrence (28,41, 42,84).",Hybrids,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,9,1
"Red pine is confined to the Northern Forest region and the southern fringe of the Boreal Forest region. It grows in a narrow zone about 2400 km (1,500 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide around the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, most of it within or closely adjacent to the area glaciated during the late Pleistocene (76). Its range extends from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, southern Quebec, and Maine, westward to central Ontario and southeastern Manitoba, southward to southeastern Minnesota and eastward to Wisconsin, Michigan, southern Ontario, northern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. It also grows locally in northern Illinois, eastern West Virginia, and Newfoundland (53). - The native range of red pine.",Native Range,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,11,1
"Although appreciable natural variation between red pine stands within a region has been noted, it appears to reflect largely non-genetic environmental effects. Actually, variation in progeny means from individual trees can be as great as, or greater than, that between population or provenance means. Conclusions from an Ontario study were that the variation pattern of red pine was predominantly random from stand to stand. In a Wisconsin study, family differences contributed the bulk of the variation observed with differences among stands and seed collection regions contributing little. Despite the unusual uniformity of the species, occasional red pines have been found with fastigiate branching, unusually slender branches, markedly suppressed lateral branching, or dwarf habit. Very small occurrences of albino or chlorophyll-deficient mutant seedlings, and tetraploid seedlings have been reported. Red pine shows only minor inbreeding depression following selfing-an indication that it carries few deleterious mutant genes. In Ontario individual open grown red pine trees showed differences in susceptibility to attack by Neodiprion lecontei (1,28,33,40,42,76).",Population Differences,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Red pine is monoecious; the flowers appear between April and June. The female flowers, 2 to 4 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) long, are borne mostly in the middle third of the crown (in the upper third in older trees), and the purple male flowers, 10 to 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long, are borne in the lower crown. In Ontario and northern Minnesota, the cone first becomes visible in late May or early June, although the cone primordia are differentiated in June to August of the previous year. Pollination occurs during late May or early June when the cone is about 4 mm (0.2 in) long. By late summer the cone is 10 to 15 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long and stops growing for the season. Insects, weather extremes, and other damaging agents may cause the loss of 60 percent of the cones between the first and second year of their development. The remaining cones begin further growth the next spring, but actual fertilization does not take place until mid-July of the second year (13 months after pollination) when cone growth is completed and the fully developed seed coats have hardened. At that time the cone is 37 to 50 mm (1.5 to 2.0 in) long (37,52,56). Seedfall begins at the time cones ripen and continues throughout the winter and into the next summer, although the bulk of it can be deferred by cool, wet weather (which retards cone opening). The heaviest and most viable seed falls the first month. From year to year, soundness of the dispersed seed varied from 14 to 86 percent in Michigan and Manitoba; it was highest in the best crop years (19,74,76,81). Above-normal temperatures in April, July, August, and September, 2 years before cone maturity, favor cone production. Cone production is better on branches that are young, thick, long, and on the south side of the tree. Many of the seeds are viable when the cones have become purple with reddish brown scale tips or have a specific gravity of about 0.80 to 0.94 (they float in kerosene), but they are not dispersed until the cones are completely brown (specific gravity about 0.60). The cones themselves usually fall the next spring or summer, although some may remain on the tree 2 or 3 years (37,52,57,76). Seed Production and Dissemination- Under favorable growing conditions planted red pines have produced staminate (male) flowers at age 9, ovulate (female) flowers at age 5, and viable seed at age 12. Normally, however, seed production begins at about 15 to 25 years in open grown trees and at 50 to 60 years for those in closed stands. Seed production usually is best in trees from 50 to 150 years of age with an average cone production per tree of about 18 liters (0.5 bushel). The final cone yield (number of survivors/number of female flowers initiated) ranges from 0 to 81 percent from year to year and often is only about 20 percent. Good seed crops are produced at intervals of 3 to 7 years with light crops in most intervening years (about one year in four may have little or no seed production). Bumper cone crops are produced only once every 10 to 12 years (31,56,76,90). Only about 45 percent of the scales on a typical red pine cone produce viable seed. At the time of pollination a typical red pine cone has from 30 to 110 (average 60 to 90) ovules that are capable of becoming seeds, but only about half of them actually develop. Cones produced in the upper third of the crown produce more good seeds than those at lower levels, and cones borne on main branch terminals produce more than those borne on lateral terminals. Cone production per tree improves as stand density decreases. The number of cones produced per tree in a mature medium-stocked stand during a good seed year averages 50 for unthrifty trees, 200 for medium trees, 400 for vigorous and partly open grown trees, and 725 for open grown trees. In seed production areas in the northern Lake States-with 200 to 250 trees per hectare (80 to 100/acre), there may be about 87,500 cones per hectare (35,000/acre) in a good crop year and 17,500/ha (7,100/acre) in a low crop year (57,58,76). In dense stands less than 20 percent of the trees may produce cones, and the seedfall may average less than 10 seeds per tree. Hence, thinning helps increase red pine cone production per tree, and the recommended average spacing between trees for seed production areas is one-half the average height of dominant and codominant trees. Applying fertilizers also may improve cone production on trees 45 years of age or older with well-developed crowns. Some trees are consistently good and others consistently poor cone producers. Up to 751,000 sound seeds per hectare (300,000/acre) have been found in southeastern Manitoba, and 2,767,000/ha (1,120,000/acre) in Minnesota (19,20,23,30,74,76). Seeds are light. Cleaned seed averages about 115,000/kg (52,000/lb) and ranges from 66,000 to 156,000/kg (30,000 to 71,000/lb). The cones open best on hot, still autumn days when there is little wind to carry the seeds far. Seeds may be disseminated up to 275 m (900 ft) from the parent tree, but the effective range, as measured by established seedlings, averages about 12 m (40 ft). Several factors may reduce red pine seed crops: prolonged rainy weather at the time of pollination; fire injury; many species of insects which consume the flowers and seeds or damage the cones; squirrels, mice, and other animals and several songbirds which eat the seeds or damage cone bearing branches; and an unidentified witches' broom (49,76). Seedling Establishment and Development- In nature red pine stands become established following fire, the only natural agent capable of providing most of the conditions required for natural red pine reproduction. Summer surface fires with an energy output rate less than 700 kW/m of front (200 Btu/(s·ft)) can provide a satisfactory seedbed, kill back some competing tree species, reduce brush competition the first few years, reduce cone insect populations, and produce an open overstory canopy. Given such a fire, other conditions such as the following would be required to ensure the establishment of a new red pine stand: a good red pine seed crop, not too thick a layer of ashes, weather conditions favorable for seed germination and seedling establishment, and subsequent freedom from fire for several decades. Based on observations of old growth stands in north-central Minnesota such a combination of conditions in a given locality may occur only about once in 75 to 100 years (21,61, 76,96). Germination is epigeal (45). Most seedlings emerge when the temperature is from 21° to 30° C (70° to 86° F). In northern Minnesota, seedlings were established only in those years with rainfall more than 100 mm (4 in) for May, June, and July, or a little less if followed by good rainfall the latter part of the growing season. If rainfall is deficient, the seeds can lie over for 1 to 3 years before germinating. Occasionally a few seeds germinate in the fall. Heavy seeds produce heavier seedlings than do lighter seeds, and the heavier seedlings outgrow the lighter seedlings for at least the first 10 years. Red pine seeds may germinate, but seedlings do not grow beneath dense brush, on heavy litter or sod, or on recent bums with a heavy cover of ashes. Germination is best under conditions that favor high moisture content in the seed, such as a fine sand seedbed, thin moss or litter, a water table within 1.2 m (4 ft) of the soil surface, some shade, abundant precipitation, and light covering of the seed. Germination is satisfactory at a range of soil reactions but is reduced at pH 8.5 or higher. Young seedlings grow best on soil media with good moisture retention, a high cation exchange capacity, and low pH- 5.1 to 5.5. Germination is inhibited by full sunlight for 4 hours or more per day (2,21,29,45,69,70,76). Approximately 35 percent of full sunlight offers satisfactory conditions for red pine seedlings to become established and they can achieve maximum height growth in as little as 45 percent of full sunlight up to age 5. Establishment is uncertain with light values below 17 percent, although very young seedlings can exist in less than 3 percent light. Because decreasing light levels diminish root weight more than top weight, shade grown seedlings are smaller in all dimensions (stem length and dry weight of stem, foliage, and roots) except needle length than those grown in full sunlight, and the average rate of photosynthesis is higher in shade grown shoots. After they have grown above the sparse ground cover that favored germination and early survival, the number of seedlings per hectare seems to increase with light up to full daylight. The height growth of the red pine seedlings also increases with increasing sunlight up to 63 percent of full daylight, or up to 6 hours of full sunlight, and their dry weight increases up to full light (44,54,76). The age of the mother tree appears to affect the time of flushing in first-year seedlings; it is earliest in progeny of mother trees 80 to 120 years old, and later in progeny of trees less than 30 years old and trees more than 121 years old (76). The time that shoot growth begins and ends varies with the season within a locality and with the climatic conditions over the range of red pine. Reserves in old needles contribute up to 80 percent or more to total shoot elongation, and phloem-translocated reserves from main branches, main stem, and roots contribute most of the balance. Terminal shoot growth begins in the spring when the mean weekly air temperature is about 10° C (50° F) and the current soil temperature is from 13.3° C (56° F) at the surface to 5.6° C (42° F) at a depth of 61 cm (24 in); this growth is completed in 43 to 123 days depending upon the locality and season (48,71,76). The period of cambial growth begins a little later than shoot elongation and is only about two-thirds completed when shoot growth ceases. In seedlings, summer wood formation begins when needle elongation stops. The roots continue to grow after cambial growth stops. After this the needles reach their maximum growth rate, followed by a second high of cambial growth. After nearly all growth is completed and a full complement of needles is functioning, the roots reach a second maximum of elongation. Radial growth seems to be closely related to the precipitation of the current season, especially in the early part of the growing season (25,76). Red pine seedlings usually grow slowly in the wild, especially if they are shaded. At the end of the first year, wild seedlings often are less than 3 cm (1 in) tall. After 4 or 5 years the growth rate begins to increase, but seedlings usually take 4 to 10 years to reach breast height (1.37 m or 4.5 ft) and overtopped seedlings may take 15 to 16 years. For many years thereafter height growth may average about 0.3 m (I ft) per year in the Lake States and Ontario and 0.5 m (1.5 ft) per year in the Northeast (76,90). The productivity of the site is reflected by the average annual height growth above breast height or better, above 2.4 m (8 ft), ranging from 25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 in) for poor to good sites (6,13,76,90). Vegetative Reproduction- In nature red pine does not reproduce vegetatively. Only with great difficulty can stem cuttings or leaf bundles be rooted artificially regardless of treatment, and no successful propagation of red pine by tissue culture methods has yet been reported. As many as 84 percent of cuttings, taken during the summer from side branches of 3-year-old red pine seedlings, took root in sand under mist if the stock plants had been fertilized heavily and the cuttings had been treated with indolebutyric acid and water. The rooted cuttings at I year were equal to or better than 2-0 nursery grown seedlings (76). Dormant red pine scions kept overwinter at -18° C (0° F) can be field grafted successfully onto red pine and Scotch pine (P. sylvestris) stocks in the spring. Successful grafts also have been made on eastern white pine and Mugho pine (P. mugo). Side veneer grafting of dormant scions on potted rootstock forced in the greenhouse in February has been successful in northern Wisconsin. Grafting is rarely successful on jack pine stocks. Semisucculent shoots from 12-year-old red pine trees were successfully cleft grafted on 9-year-old Scotch pine in the field; the shoots were collected and on the same day were grafted on current season's shoots that had just completed height growth. Incompatibility of interspecific grafts, however, appears to be a serious problem (28,47,64,76).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,13,1
"In the forest, red pine normally is a tall, slender tree with a smooth, straight, clear bole of little taper. Young trees have long pyramidal crowns of stout horizontal branches (tilted slightly upwards near the top of the tree) in regular whorls (one produced each year). Occasionally a second flush produces lammas shoots in late summer. Old trees have short, broad, flattened crowns with heavy branches. The rate of branch extension, and hence, crown width, diminishes with age and largely ceases when the canopy closes. The quantity of foliage per tree and branch diameter also decrease with increasing stand density, although foliage weight per unit area increases at close spacings until the canopy closes. In Lake State stands the dry weight of above ground parts was about 20 percent for the crown (about one-third foliage) and 80 percent for the bole. Stump and roots weighed about 20 percent of the above ground portions. Removal of the stump and main root system can greatly reduce the macronutrients on the site, but atmospheric and precipitation nutrient inputs over a rotation can more than offset this removal. The center of gravity was at about one-third the height above the butt (7,46,76,85, 88,90). Growth and Yield- Cambial growth occurs as springwood cells during the period of active elongation and high auxin synthesis. Summerwood cells are produced following the cessation of terminal growth and consequent reduction in auxin synthesis. The transition from springwood to summerwood varies from season to season in timing and duration and from tree to tree but apparently is associated with seasonal depletion in soil moisture (76). The amount and distribution of wood growth on the stem are determined largely by crown size and distributions (51). For the first 50 years height growth on average sites in Minnesota averages about 30 cm (12 in) per year. Between 50 and 100 years the rate is more than 15 cm (6 in) per year. For the next 30 years the rate is only about 7.5 cm (3 in) per year. From 130 to 150 years it drops to 3 cm (1 in). After 150 years height growth almost stops, although diameter growth continues at a slow rate for several years longer. The oldest tree age recorded is 307 years although a tree estimated to be 400 years old was measured on the Chippewa National Forest in north-central Minnesota. Normally, mature red pines are about 21 to 24 m (70 to 80 ft) tall, with d.b.h. up to 91 cm (36 in), although trees have attained 46 m (150 ft) in height and 152 cm (60 in) in d.b.h. (17,76). Height growth reflects site quality and the amount of overhead shade or growth disruption, as by terminal feeding insects or other pests; it is greatest on the best sites and least on poor sites or those with a heavy overstory or severe pest damage (table 1). if red pines make up the overstory, the average height of dominant and codominant trees at 50 years (site index) is used to measure site quality. In northern Minnesota the site index ranges from about 14 m (45 ft) for poor sites to 23 m (75 ft) for very good sites (13,100). In southeastern Minnesota there are planted stands 26-37 years old with site indices of 27-29 m (90-95 ft) (Donald H. Prettyman, personal communication). Diameter growth improves with increasing live crown size, which in turn is affected by stand density. The length of live crown in relation to total tree height ranges from 7 percent in dense stands to 75 percent in open stands (35,50,72,86,90). Rooting Habit- During the first summer, seedlings may develop taproots 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) long. Early rooting depth is fostered by the presence of a water table within 1.2 m (4 ft) of the soil surface and a loose soil. Lateral growth usually outstrips vertical growth after the first year. Most root elongation takes place in the spring and early summer with a second spurt in early fall; prevailing soil moisture and temperature conditions influence the timing and intensity of growth (59,76,90,98). The usually well-developed root system in old trees tends to be wide spreading and moderately deep. There are numerous stout lateral roots (and often a taproot) with vertical branches (sinkers) descending at acute angles and often some ascending to within 13 mm (0.5 in) of the surface, giving the tree strong support and making it windfirm. The root system is more extensive on loamy sands than on fine sandy loams. The lateral roots radiate in an irregular oval shape from the tree at irregular intervals, usually remaining within 10 to 46 cm (4 to 18 in) of the surface and sometimes attaining a length greater than tree height in stands up to 9.4 m (31 ft) tall. They may grow as much as 104 to 130 cm (41 to 51 in) in a year, but usually much less. By 45 to 50 years stem height is twice the length of the longest laterals. Fine roots develop along the main laterals. If unhindered by competition of neighboring trees, the longest laterals may extend 12.2 m (40 ft) beyond the crown limits. In stands, however, the lateral roots are forced to share growing space with root systems of a number of other trees. For example, in an Ontario plantation the roots of a red pine 8.2 m (27 ft) tall extended into the growing space of 23 other trees, and its own space was invaded by the roots of 11 trees. Both central and lateral vertical roots occur, and these commonly penetrate from 1.5 to 4.6 m (5 to 15 ft) and grow slowly after the first 10 years. Generally the taproot and other vertical roots tend to go through rather than around materials that are difficult to penetrate (in contrast to white pine roots that tend to go around such obstacles). Red pine roots die back in soils seasonally saturated for more than 3 months and their downward growth is restricted if soil drainage is poor. Hardpan, gley near the surface, coarse compacted soils, and those with bulk densities exceeding 1.40 g/cm³ (0.81 oz/in³) stunt root systems (16,27,76, 89,90). Mycorrhizae formed on the roots of red pine seedlings by Boletinus pictus, Tylopilus felleus, Cenococcum graniforme, Gomphidius superiorensis, G. vinicolor, several species of Suillus and Scleroderma aurantium improve the uptake of soil moisture and mineral nutrients (39,67,68,73). Natural root grafts, usually 10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 in) below the soil surface, are common in red pines past 15 years old, especially where there is pressure as when two roots grow over or adjacent to a stone. The majority of trees in a stand may be connected directly or in directly with one to six other trees. Grafting is more common among large roots, but occasionally small roots are joined with larger ones. Thinning seems to stimulate an increase in root grafts. Such grafts may transmit diseases (such as Heterobasidion annosum), silvicides, and fertilizers but they also retard insect and disease effects on the stumps of cut trees, sustain weak trees during droughts (by transmitting moisture and nutrients), increase windfirmness, and keep girdled trees alive for several years (32,43,44,76,90,92). Reaction to Competition- Red pine is less shade tolerant than common associates other than jack pine, the aspens, paper birch, and gray birch (Betula populifolia). Based on a scale that ranges from 10.0 for eastern hemlock (extremely shade tolerant) to 0.7 for the aspens (extremely shade intolerant), red pine rates 2.4 along with black ash (Fraxinus nigra) and black cherry (Prunus serotina). Other classifications include red pine in the fourth lowest of five tolerance classes (intolerant). Red pine becomes more intolerant as the environment becomes warmer. Although seedlings may be more tolerant than older trees, they grow very slowly under cover. Most natural red pine stands are understocked, but an occasional sapling stand may be dense with as many as 49,400 stems per hectare (20,000/acre). Stands 15 to 20 years old with fewer than 6,200 trees per hectare (2,500/acre) seem able to thin themselves, but denser stands stagnate. Dense stands respond well to thinning. To age 67 on an excellent site in Wisconsin, red pine has made full volume growth when thinned periodically from age 32, to an average spacing of 20 percent of height of dominants. Thinning was done after each 2.1 or 2.4 m (7 or 8 ft) of added height growth. Height growth of dominants was retarded after spacing became closer than 15 percent of height. The range of stand density for full volume growth remains to be determined. Although stand density is important in the control of size and quality of timber trees, red pine volume growth varies little over a wide range of stocking conditions (14 to 34 m²/ha or more basal area, or 60 to 150 ft²/acre). On good sites basal area growth ceases when it reaches a level of about 57 m²/ha (250 ft²/acre) (11,17,22,76,90,101). Diameter growth begins earliest, is fastest, and continues longest in dominant trees. The reverse is true of suppressed trees. Overhead cover restricts height growth, but red pines overtopped by oaks and red maple for as long as 40 years have responded to release. In dense stands dominance is well expressed by age 10 to 12. At wider spacing the differentiation into crown classes occurs later, usually after 20 or 30 years. In fully stocked stands the percentage of trees in the dominant and codominant crown classes increases from about 45, when average d.b.h. is 5 cm (2 in), to 90, when d.b.h. is 36 cm (14 in). In less dense stands the percentage of dominants and codominants is higher. Beginning at about age 25 in dense stands, red pine prunes itself better than any other northern conifer except tamarack. Even in dense stands, however, there may be little natural pruning during the first 40 years. In more open stands pruning is delayed to a greater age. On some infertile sands, however, lower branches die off even if crowns are not closed. In the absence of fire or other catastrophes, the ecological succession in the Lake States is from jack pine to red pine to white pine and finally to northern hardwoods; the rate of succession is likely to be more rapid on the better sites. On the coarser, more infertile sands, succession apparently stops short of the northern hardwood climax and red pine may be a long-persisting subclimax. In much of northern New England and eastern Canada, succession may be to spruce-fir and eastern hemlock. In northeastern Minnesota it may be to spruce-fir alone rather than to northern hardwoods (66,76). Because the crown is not only the source but also the regulating center for all wood growth, silviculturists can manipulate the stand and some features of site to influence both the quantity and quality of wood desired on various parts of the tree bole. They can thin, prune, fertilize, drain excess moisture, and control insects and diseases to this end under specific circumstances (51). Because of its shade intolerance, red pine grows best in even-aged groups or stands and is well adapted to even-aged management. Depending on conditions and management objectives either the shelterwood system or clearcutting followed by planting or seeding may be used. Natural red pine stands in the Lake States commonly are understocked and produce average yields about one-third those produced by well stocked unmanaged stands. Yet even in these understocked stands yields can be increased by about 50 percent with intensive management. For well stocked stands, yields (including intermediate cuts) can be about doubled if managed wisely (13,14,17,76,101). Damaging Agents- Although red pine has had fewer serious enemies than most associated species when growing under conditions natural to its native range, nevertheless it is damaged by a number of agents. When grown on less acid, finer textured, and more poorly drained soils and under milder climatic conditions than those to which it is adapted, red pine is subject to damage by additional destructive agents. The following hinder red pine seed germination and early survival: summer drought and high surface soil temperatures; sudden drops in temperature in the early fall, prolonged for about 24 hours, and winter drying of foliage; unidentified insects that consume seedlings shortly after they germinate; competition of subordinate vegetation; post-emergent damping-off (usually caused by fungi of the genera Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Pythium, and Phytophthora), birds, rodents, flooding, trampling by large animals, and smothering by litter; and large doses of herbicides (29,76,90,94). Beyond the early establishment stage red pine may be killed or seriously damaged by many physical and biotic environmental factors. Fire may kill red pines in stands up to 21 m (69 ft) tall. Ice and sleet storms and very strong winds have caused serious breakage and windfall in red pine stands. Spray from de-icing salt (sodium chloride) along well traveled highways has caused red pine mortality and poor growth. Spring flooding for 20 days kills red pine (21,60,76,90,92,93,96). About 100 insect species are known to feed on red pine, but only a few usually cause mortality or serious injury. Several sawflies (Neodiprion lecontei, N. sertifer, N. abbotii, N. nanalus, N. pratti pratti, N. compar, N. pinetum, Diprion frutetorum, D. similis, Acantholyda erythrocephala, A. pini, and A. zappei) defoliate and often kill seedlings, and some of them damage older trees also. Trees in young stands, especially plantations, may sustain mortality or serious injury from the Saratoga spittlebug (Aphrophora saratogensis), the Zimmerman pine moth (Dioryctria zimmermani), the red pine shoot moth (D. resinosella) or the Allegheny mound ant (Formica exsectoides). The red pine scale (Matsucoccus resinosae), especially in the Northeast, kills or severely injures red pines from seedlings to mature trees. The European pine shoot moth (Rhyaciona buoliana) frequently deforms young red pine. White grubs (such as Phyllophaga rugosa, P. tristis, Diplotaxis sordida, and Serica spp.) cut the roots of the seedlings and often induce mortality in dry years (10,34,75,76,102). In periods of peak population, the snowshoe hare and the cottontail often kill or reduce height growth of red pine seedlings. When preferred foods are lacking, white-tailed deer browse or destroy red pine seedlings. Porcupines girdle red pines from sapling to mature trees (9,76). The North American strain of scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina) has caused the loss of a number of young plantations in the Lake States; in the Northeast, the European strain of scleroderris canker has killed mature red pine. Needle cast diseases can retard growth of red pine and kill small trees. These include Lophodermium pinastri and Scirrhia acicola. Sirococcus tip blight (Sirococcus strobilinus) can cause failure of natural regeneration when overstory trees are infected. Coleosporium asterum stunts the growth of new shoots while sweetfern blister rust (Cronartium comptoniae) deforms young trees. In nurseries, Cylindrocladium scoparium occasionally causes severe losses through root rot, damping off-, and needle blight, and annosus root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) and the shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) cause death of trees in planted and natural stands (7,39,63,65,68,76,82, 83,90).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,14,1
"Natural stands of red pine are confined largely to sandy soils. They are most common on Entisols followed in order by Spodosols, Alfisols, and Inceptisols. Common materials are glaciofluvial and aeolian in origin, and lacustrine deposits and loamy and finer till soils are less frequently occupied. Red pine commonly grows on dry soils low in fertility, but it is also found on a variety of sites including organic debris over rock outcrops and some structured lacustrine red clays, where it may be somewhat stunted, however. Red pine is rarely found in swamps but is common along swamp borders. It does not grow where the surface soil is alkaline, although it grows on dry, acid soils overlying well drained limestones or calcareous soils. Although it can grow well on silt loams, red pine grows only sporadically on heavier soils, probably because of its inability to compete with more aggressive species and because of root injuries known to occur on some such soils. It grows especially well (height growth may be doubled) on naturally sub-irrigated soils with well aerated surface layers and a water table at a depth of 1 to 3 m (4 to 9 ft) in Wisconsin. Best plantation development is made on soils that range from moderately drained to those without substantial moisture stress (8,11,16,24,55, 90,91,95,100). In typical old growth stands in the Lake States the organic layer (L, F, and H layers) seldom builds up to a depth of more than 5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 in), and its ovendry weight increases with stand density from 12 300 to 84 100 kg/ha (11,000 to 75,000 lb/acre). Beneath is a gray, leached layer of sandy soil 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) thick overlying a brownish layer of sandy soil 1 or more meters (3 or more feet) thick. Sometimes discontinuous bands or lenses of finer textured material are found at depths up to 3 m (9 ft) and their silt-plus-clay content improves the productivity of red pine. In dry summers almost all available moisture may be withdrawn to a depth of 0.6 to 2.1 m (2 to 7 ft) or more. Red pine grows satisfactorily on soils that, in the upper 25 cm (10 in), have a pH of 4.5 to 6.0, a bulk density of about 1.30 g/cm³ (0.75 oz/in³), a silt-plus-clay content of 10 to 40 percent, available water storage capacity of 6 to 23 percent, a base exchange capacity of 2 to 11 milliequivalents (meq) per 100 g, organic matter content of at least 1.7 percent, total nitrogen content of 1100 to 1700 kg/ha (1,000 to 1,500 lb/acre), available phosphorus of 34 to 146 kg/ha (30 to 130 lb/acre), available potassium of 126 to 157 kg/ha (112 to 140 lb/acre), exchangeable calcium of 0.80 to 2.00 meq per 100 g, and exchangeable magnesium of 0.20 to 0.45 meq per 100 g (3,4,5,12,36, 76,99). In the Lake States and Ontario, red pine grows most commonly on level or gently rolling sand plains or on low ridges adjacent to lakes and swamps, at elevations from 240 to 430 m (800 to 1,400 ft) above sea level. In the East it is found not only on outwash plains but also on mountain slopes and hilltops. It grows chiefly at elevations between 210 and 400 m (700 to 1,300 ft) above sea level in New England, and up to 820 m (2,700 ft) in the Adirondacks. The West Virginia outliers are found at an elevation of 945 to 1290 m (3,100 to 4,200 ft) above sea level. In Canada the production of red pine increases from pine ridges to pine plains to pine uplands (44,76,87).",Soils and Topography,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,15,1
"Red pine has been grown primarily for the production of wood for lumber, piling, poles, cabin logs, railway ties, posts, mine timbers, box boards, pulpwood, and fuel. It has been one of the most extensively planted species in the northern United States and Canada, not only for wood production but also for dune and sandblow control, snowbreaks, windbreaks, and Christmas trees. Even when wood production is the main goal, red pine forests often are managed throughout their rotation for other uses such as recreation, wildlife habitat, and watersheds. On sandy farmland in the Lake States, narrow strips (usually 3 to 8 rows) of red pine have been planted at intervals to reduce wind-caused soil erosion in the fields. Similarly, narrow strips have been planted along roads to control snow drifting and to improve scenic aspects. Red pine has been planted to help control sand dunes near Lake Michigan and also to control ""sandblows"" that develop when cover is removed from light sandy soils. Such stands should be managed to retain long live crowns and to maintain good vigor without losing essential reduction of wind velocities. Red pine stands are popular places for hiking, camping, and other recreational activities, especially when the trees are large and located near a lake or stream. Red pine forests used for recreation should be managed to maintain a high proportion of large old-growth trees. Red pine stands produce litter (more than 9000 kg/ha or 8,000 lb/acre at age 15) that helps prevent erosion by absorbing moisture, but they also contribute to moisture depletion in the top 1 m (3.3 ft) of soil. Such stands also increase the snowpack water content and consequently the spring snowmelt runoff over that of unplanted areas or those growing deciduous trees. The water yield of red pine stands in Minnesota was less than for aspen stands and decreased with stand density. Well stocked young red pine stands intercept some precipitation (average throughfall is 87 percent and stem flow 2 percent of precipitation). The management of red pine stands should be coordinated with that of other types on a watershed so as to deter soil erosion and maintain an even flow of high quality water. Although red pine stands generally are considered poor habitat for game birds and animals, they provide cover, nesting sites, and some food for many species of birds and animals. For wildlife purposes the stands should be managed in patches so as to provide an array of conditions from small openings to mature groups (13,14,15,18,38,77,78,79,80,97).",Special Uses,Red Pine,pinus,resinosa,conifer,16,1
"Pure stands of red spruce comprise the forest cover type Red Spruce (Society of American Foresters Type 32). Red spruce is also a major component in 5 and a minor component in 13 other forest cover types (10): 5 Balsam Fir 12 Black Spruce 16 Aspen 17 Pin Cherry 18 Paper Birch 21 Eastern White Pine 22 White Pine-Hemlock 23 Eastern Hemlock 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 30 Red Spruce-Yellow Birch 31 Red Spruce-Sugar Maple-Beech 33 Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 34 Red Spruce-Fraser Fir 35 Paper Birch-Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 37 Northern White-Cedar 60 Beech-Sugar Maple 107 White Spruce 108 Red Maple Some of the shrubs associated with red spruce are: blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), hobblebush (Viburnum lantanoides), witherod (V. cassinoides), rhodora (Rhododendron canadense), lambkill (Kalmia angustifolia), mountain-holly (Nemopanthus mucronata), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus var. strigosus), creeping snowberry (Gaultheria hispidula), wintergreen (G. procumbens), fly honeysuckle (Lonicera canadensis), gooseberry (Ribes spp.), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), downey serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea), beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), and Canada yew (Taxus canadensis). A number of mosses and herbs are also found growing in red spruce forest types. Certain mosses, herbs, and shrubs, however, have been shown to be related to site quality of red spruce (22). The three main associations, Hylocomium/Oxalis, Oxalis/Cornus, and Viburnum/0xalis, in that order, indicate increasing site productivity and increasing hardwood competition. Similar site types in the higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina include Hylocomium/Oxalis on north-facing slopes above 1520 m (5,000 ft), Oxalis/Dryopteris at high elevations and all exposures, and the best site type for red spruce and Fraser fir, Viburnum/Vaccinium/Dryopteris (47). The Oxalis/Cornus association is considered the best for growing conditions in the northern part of the range. On these sites the soil is rich enough for red spruce but not fertile enough for the tolerant hardwoods to offer serious competition (22).",Associated Forest Cover,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,1,1
"Red spruce grows best in a cool, moist climate. The climate of the northeastern part of its range can be summarized as follows: annual precipitation (total), 910 to 1320 mm (36 to 52 in); annual snowfall, 203 to 406 cm (80 to 160 in); days with snow cover, 100 to 140; January temperature, -7° to -1° C (20° to 30° F) maximum and -18° to -13° C (0° to 8° F) minimum; July temperature, 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F) maximum, and 11° to 14° C (52° to 58° F) minimum; frost-free days, 90 to 150 (28). Red spruce attains maximum development in the higher parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains where the atmosphere is more humid and the rainfall heavier during the growing season than in other parts of its range (47). Local extension of the range of red spruce, as along the southern Maine coast, is related to marine exposure, which provides a cool growing season and ample moisture supply (8).",Climate,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,2,1
"Successful interspecific crosses with Picea rubens as male or female parents have been reported or confirmed for P. mariana, P. omorika, P. glehnii, P. orientalis, and P. koyamai (15); P. sitchensis (14); P. glauca, P. mexicana (16); P. x lutzii Little (P. sitchensis x P. glauca), P. maximowiczii, and P. likiangensis (19).

"The range of red spruce extends from the Maritime Provinces of Canada west to Maine, southern Quebec, and southeastern Ontario, and south into central New York, eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, and Massachusetts. It also grows south along the Appalachian Mountains in extreme western Maryland, and eastern West Virginia, and north and west in Virginia, western North Carolina, and eastern Tennessee. Discontinuous stands may also be found in Haliburton Township, in Algonquin Provincial Park, and near Sturgeon Falls in Nippising Township, and in the southwestern Parry Sound District in Ontario, Canada. - The native range of red spruce.",Native Range,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Red spruce is monoecious; male and female flower buds open in May in axils of the previous year's shoots on different branches of the same tree. The pendant male flowers are bright red; female flowers are erect and bright green tinged with purple (21). Although cone buds differentiate as early as July preceding flowering in the following spring, they are difficult to distinguish until September. For experienced workers they provide a possible means of identifying seed years at that time. The cones mature from about mid-September to early October, the autumn following flowering (41). Cones are 3 to 4 cm (1.3 to 1.5 in) long, light reddish brown, with rigid, rounded scales often slightly toothed on the edges. Cones are receptive to pollen when fully open, a condition which lasts for only a few days. Seed Production and Dissemination- Good seed crops occur every 3 to 8 years, with light crops during intervening years (22). Red spruce cones number about 140/liter (5,000/bu), which yields 454 to 680 g (1.0 to 1.5 lb) of seeds. The number of cleaned seeds per kilogram ranges between 220,000 and 637,000 (100,000 and 289,000/lb), with an average of about 306,000 (139,000/lb) (41). Red spruce seeds fall about 1.2 m (4 ft) per second in still air; the following formula determines distance of travel for wind- disseminated spruce seeds at various heights (47): D = Sh (1.47v) Where D = distance in feet which seed will travel, S = number of seconds required for seed to fall from a height of h (ft) on a tree, and v = velocity of the prevailing wind in miles per hour. Randall (37), in a study of seed dispersal into clearcut areas, stated that at a distance of 100 m (5 chains or 330 ft) from the timber edge, the number of spruce seeds trapped were more than adequate for regeneration in a good seed year and adequate in an average year. Most of the spruce in the surrounding stands was red spruce. Seedling Development- Most red spruce seeds germinate the spring following dispersal; some, however, may germinate in the fall soon after dropping from the tree. Germination is epigeal. On favorable seedbeds the usual spring germination period is from late May to early July. On duff, which is more subject to surface drying than most other seedbed materials, some seeds may lose viability by midsummer, and some may show delayed germination well into August (22). Little if any viable seeds remain in the forest floor beyond 1 year (13). Adequate moisture is the chief factor controlling germination of red spruce. Germination takes place on almost any medium (mineral soil, rotten wood, or shallow duff) except sod. Mineral soil is an excellent seedbed for germination. Generally ample moisture is available and soil temperatures are moderate. Litter and humus are poorer seedbeds because they are likely to be hotter and drier than mineral soil (11). On thicker duff, germination may be poor also because moisture conditions are less favorable. Temperatures of 20° to 30° C (68° to 86° F) are generally favorable for germination. Seeds will not germinate satisfactorily at temperatures below 20° C (68° F) and are permanently injured by long exposure to temperatures higher than 33° C (92° F) (22). Germination and initial establishment proceed best under cover. Seedlings can become established under light intensities as low as 10 percent of full sunlight; however, as they develop, they require light intensities of 50 percent or more for optimum growth. Seedlings starting in the open undergo heavy mortality when soil surface temperatures reach 46° to 54° C (115° to 130° F) even for a short time (11). Drought and frost heaving are major causes of mortality the first year. Crushing by hardwood litter and snow are also causes of seedling mortality. Winter drying in some years and locations can cause severe leader damage and dieback. Natural reproduction depends more on seedling survival than on requirements for germination. Spruce seedlings have an exceptionally slow-growing, fibrous, shallow root system. Consequently, a critical factor in their survival and establishment is the depth of the 01 organic layers of the soil profile. When the combined thickness of these layers exceeds 5 cm (2 in), spruce seedlings may not reach mineral soil and the moisture necessary to carry them through dry periods. Red spruce seedlings and the commonly associated balsam fir seedlings are similar in many ways and are controlled by the same factors, but as a rule spruce is the weaker, slower growing species during the establishment period (22). Seedlings that have attained a height of about 15 cm (6 in) can be considered established. Once established, their early growth is determined largely by the amount and character of overhead competition. Dense growth of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), raspberry, and hardwood sprouts are the chief competition for seedlings on heavily cutover lands; but red spruce survives as much as 145 years of suppression and still responds to release (11,39). Compared to its associates, red spruce is one of the last species to start height growth in the spring, usually beginning the first week in June and ending 9 to 11 weeks later. Radial growth usually begins about the second week of June and continues through August (22). Vegetative Reproduction- Red spruce rarely, if ever, layers (15,22,45). Recently developed techniques facilitate propagation from stem cuttings under controlled conditions, particularly juvenile cuttings (7,9,38,45).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Red spruce is a medium-size tree at maturity, reaching 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h. and 18 to 23 m (60 to 75 ft) in height in the Northeast, and up to 35 m (115 ft) in the Appalachian Mountains. Its maximum age is about 400 years (22). The American Forestry Association lists a tree 133 cm (52.5 in) in d.b.h. and 33.5 m (110 ft) tall in Great Smoky National Park in North Carolina as the largest living red spruce. The rate of red spruce's growth is strongly influenced by light conditions. Although trees can live in dense shade for many years, once they reach sapling to pole stage nearly full sunlight is beneficial. Understory trees no more than 1.2 or 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) tall may be more than 50 years old, whereas trees of the same age in the open may be approaching small sawtimber size (22). Under favorable conditions, red spruce may reach an average d.b.h. of 10 cm (4 in) and height of 7 m (23 ft) in 20 years, and be over 23 cm (9 in) in d.b.h. and 19 m (62 ft) tall in 60 years (22). Diameter growth of red spruce has been related to vigor, live crown ratio (ratio of live crown to total height), live crown length, and initial diameter at breast height (6,32). High vigor red spruce with a live crown ratio of 0.5 or better averaged 4.3 cm (1.7 in) of diameter growth in 10 years. Growth rates of trees with smaller crown ratios and less vigorous trees decreased progressively to an average of 0.8 cm (0.3 in) in 10 years for trees of low vigor or with crown ratios smaller than 0.4 (22). A tree classification for red spruce is shown in table 1 (11). In one study (40), average net annual growth in softwood stands (66 to 100 percent softwood species) that can be expected from stands receiving minimal silvicultural input was found to be about 3.5 m³/ha (50 ft³/acre). In mixed-wood stands (21 to 65 percent softwood species) this dropped to about 2.8 m³/ha (40 ft³/acre), although the majority of the growth was contributed by softwoods. A further breakdown of the data shows the contributions of spruce, most of which was assumed to be red spruce, to be 51 percent in softwood stands and 39 percent in mixed-wood stands. Yields per acre, in total volumes of all trees larger than 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in d.b.h. (inside bark and including stump and top but not butt swell), are given in table 2 (33). These yields are normal yields from even-aged stands growing primarily on old fields. Therefore, they are higher than yields that might be expected from more irregular stands such as those developing after cutting (22). Site index has not been of great utility in rating the potential productivity of spruce-fir sites because of the tolerance of the species and its ability to survive in a suppressed state. Site index at base age 50 years is as good a measure of productivity as any of several growth functions, however (39). Recently, polymorphic site index curves were developed for even-aged spruce and fir stands in northern Maine; they should be valuable for estimating site productivity (20). Other yield tables for the Northeast (48) take into consideration stand density, composition, and time since cutting. These tables give merchantable volume of spruce and fir combined in trees 15.2 cm (6 in) in d.b.h. and larger from a 0.3 m (1 ft) stump to a 7.6 cm (3 in) top, diameter inside bark, and are somewhat conservative. Yields of merchantable volume for different stand densities from 10 to 50 years after cutting, where 90 percent of the trees are spruce and fir growing on predominantly softwood sites, are given in table 3. The development of stand projection growth models that permit computer simulation of red spruce tree growth for various management practices and silvicultural treatments over a range of stand conditions has flourished in recent years. For example, the model FIBER was developed in the Northeast (43) for spruce-fir, northern hardwood and a range of Mixedwood forest types between the two. Such models have proved very useful for forest management planning. In recent years, interest in total biomass yield and productivity has increased, and in the future is likely to become more important in management considerations. As an example, above-ground biomass and productivity values of typical red spruce stands in Canada are given in table 4 for stands in a steady state, across a moisture regime catena (17). Rooting Habit- Spruce and fir are shallow-rooted, with most of the feeding roots in the duff and the top few centimeters of mineral soil (11). The average rooting depth for all sites in Maine was found to be 33 cm (13 in), with a maximum of 56 cm (22 in) (22). Reaction to Competition- Red spruce is classified as shade tolerant in the United States and tolerant or very tolerant in Canada. Opinions differ as to whether red spruce is more tolerant than balsam fir, but the relative tolerance may vary with soil fertility and climate (22). The species' chief competition comes from balsam fir and hardwoods that produce heavy shade, like beech and maple. Competition from aspen, birch, and other thin-crowned species is not so severe. Red spruce prunes itself about as well as most softwoods in dense stands. As much as one-third of the live crown may be pruned artificially without seriously affecting radial growth (5). A number of studies have demonstrated the ability of red spruce to respond to release after many years of suppression. The vigor of this response does decline somewhat with age, however, and older trees may require about 5 years to recover before showing accelerated growth (7). Reduction of growth to about 2.5 cm (1 in) of diameter in 25 years, for a duration of 100 years, represents about the limit of suppression for red spruce. Many of its associated tree species such as balsam fir and hemlock may outgrow red spruce after release (22). Red spruce may be grown successfully using even-age silvicultural prescriptions (11,12). Red spruce is very shallow-rooted, however, making it subject to windthrow, a major silvicultural constraint in the management of the species. As a general rule, it is recommended that no more than one-fourth to one-half of the basal area be removed in the partial harvest of a spruce-fir stand, depending on site, to avoid excessive windthrow damage. Most of the major forest cover types previously listed in which red spruce is a component are considered either climax or subclimax. Damaging Agents- The shallow root system, thin bark, and flammable needles of red spruce make trees of all ages very susceptible to fire damage (11). The acreage of red spruce originally present in the southern Appalachians has been reduced to a fraction of what it once was by fire and clearcutting (22). Many former spruce sites are occupied by inferior tree species, blackberries, and ferns after 20 years (47). The most important insect enemy of red spruce is the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. Although red spruce is much less vulnerable to damage than balsam fir or white spruce, largely due to later bud flushing in the spring (3), much damage and mortality occur in stands containing large quantities of mature balsam fir. Blum and McLean (4) suggest that factors such as stand age, species composition, density, and vigor contribute to the vulnerability of spruce-fir stands to budworm damage and suggest steps to alleviate damage. Additional, detailed information may also be found in Sanders, et al. (42) for spruce-fir stands in the Northeast, the Lake States, and Canada. The eastern spruce beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis, damages mature trees of red spruce. Two species of sawflies, the European spruce sawfly, Diprion hercyniae, and the native yellowheaded spruce sawfly, Pikonema alaskensis, have severely defoliated red spruce in localized areas (22). The eastern spruce gall adelgid, Adelges abietis, can be a serious pest on spruce when abundant. The pine leaf adelgid, Pineus pinifoliae, forms unsightly but relatively harmless conelike galls on red and black spruce (Picea mariana), which are alternate hosts (46). Red spruce has few diseases. Needle cast caused by Lirula macrospora may result in severe defoliation of the lower crown and a subsequent reduction of growth. Phellinus pini and Phaeolus schweinitzii, the most destructive of red spruce wood-rotting fungi, are usually confined to overmature or damaged trees. Climacocystis borealis causes butt rot in overmature trees (22). Trees are occasionally attacked by Armillaria mellea and Inonotus tomentosa. All along the eastern Appalachian mountain chain, from the New England states to Georgia, growth has declined in high-elevation red spruce since the 1960's (25). In recent years, this decline has been accompanied by increased mortality and crown damage in high-elevation red spruce. Apparently, no significant natural biotic or abiotic causal agents have been identified, although it has been hypothesized that interaction among naturally occurring insect and disease factors and anthropogenic air pollutants, or air pollutants acting alone, are at the root of the problem. Sulphur dioxide (S02), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds are the pollutants of primary concern; secondary pollutants such as ozone and nitric and sulfuric acids are also believed to be important factors (29). Growth decline and mortality in low-elevation red spruce in northern New England, while increasing in some areas, appear to be within the normal ranges for trees and forests of various ages, compositions, and density. However, some foliar symptoms have been detected in both red spruce and white pine, particularly from ozone exposure. Red spruce is occasionally infected with eastern dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium pusillum, a parasite causing growth reduction, tree mortality, and degradation of wood quality (24). Mice and voles have been found to consume and store significant amounts of spruce seeds in preference to those of balsam fir, suggesting one reason for the low ratio of spruce to fir seedlings commonly found in naturally regenerated stands (1,23). Wildlife damage to the terminal buds of young spruce, presumably by birds, also has been noted (2). Some injury and mortality are also caused occasionally by porcupines, bears, deer, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers (11). Red squirrels clip twigs and terminals and eat reproductive and vegetative buds (41).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,14,1
"The soils where red spruce and its associates grow are mostly acid Spodosols, Inceptisols, and sometimes Histosols with a thick mor humus and a well-defined A2 horizon- characteristics commonly associated with abundant rainfall, cool climates, and softwood cover (11). Commonly, the pH of these soils ranges from 4.0 to 5.5. In northern New England, red spruce is found predominantly on shallow till soils that average about 46 cm (18 in) to a compact layer. It will grow on many sites unfavorable for other species, such as organic soils overlying rocks in mountainous locations, steep rocky slopes, thin soils, and wet bottomland (26). On poorly drained soils, lack of aeration limits growth (22). In the northern part of its range, red spruce grows at elevations from near sea level to about 1370 m (4,500 ft) (22). In the southern Appalachian Mountains it comes in at elevations as low as 1370 m (4,500 ft) and from there to about 1520 m (5,000 ft) it is mixed with hardwoods and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). At 1520 m (5,000 ft) balsam fir (Abies balsamea) joins with red spruce to form the dominant spruce-fir climax type. In West Virginia, spruce-fir stands are found as low as 980 m (3,200 ft). Above 1890 m (6,200 ft) in the southern Appalachians, red spruce appears less frequently than Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) (47). In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, balsam fir is the predominant species above 1220 m (4,000 ft) but red spruce is well represented from about 790 to 1010 m (2,600 to 3,300 ft) (27).",Soils and Topography,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,15,1
"The wood of red spruce, white spruce (Picea glauca), and black spruce cannot be distinguished with certainty by either gross characteristics or minute anatomy, and all three are usually marketed simply as eastern spruce. Chief uses are for lumber and pulpwood, with limited amounts going into poles piling, boatbuilding stock, and cooperage stock (36) Flakeboard and plywood have been made from spruce in recent years. It is also the preferred wood for piano sounding boards, guitars, mandolins, organ pipes, and violin bellies (21). Forest cover types that include red spruce support a wide variety of wildlife. They are particularly important as winter cover for deer and, to a certain extent, moose. Small game includes ruffed grouse, snowshoe hare, and woodcock. Many song birds and fur bearers also frequent these forest types (44). A unique use of red spruce was spruce gum, an exudate that accumulates on trunk wounds. This was the raw material for a flourishing chewing-gum industry in Maine during the last half of the 19th century and early years of this century (21).",Special Uses,Red Spruce,picea,rubens,conifer,16,1
"In the forest cover type Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Society of American Foresters Type 104), redbay is a major component (1). Stocking within this type may consist of combinations of any two or all three of these species, but locally a single species may dominate. It is a common associate of the following cover types: Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82), Pond Pine (Type 98), Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102), and Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103). Redbay is a minor component of the following cover types: Cabbage Palmetto (Type 74), Loblolly Pine (Type 81), Atlantic White-Cedar (Type 97), Pondcypress (Type 100), and Baldcypress (Type 101). Numerous species that grow on moist to wet sites may be associated with Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay, depending on the geographic location, site, and stand history. Common hardwoods include red maple (Acer rubrum), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), water oak Quercus nigra), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Associated conifers include slash pine (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pine (P. palustris), loblolly pine (P. taeda), pond pine (P. serotina), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), pondcypress (T distichum var. nutans), and Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides). Small trees and shrubs associated with redbay include buckwheat-tree (Cliftonia monophylla), dahoon (Ilex cassine), yaupon (I.vomitoria), inkberry (I. glabra), lyonia fetterbush (Lyonia lucida), bayberry (Myrica spp.), and poison-sumac (Toxicodendron vernix).",Associated Forest Cover,Redbay,persea,borbonia,hardwood,1,0
"Redbay grows in a climate ranging from warm-temperate along the Atlantic Coast to semitropical in southern Florida and the lower gulf coast of Texas. The frost-free period varies from a minimum of 200 days to a maximum of 365 days and is more than 250 in much of its range. Average January temperatures of these coastal areas range from 3° C (38° F) in southern Delaware to 20° C (68° F) in south Florida, with 10° to 13° C (50° to 56° F) characteristic of most of this region. Summers are hot and humid. Average July temperatures range from 26° to 28° C (78° to 82° F). Temperatures above 38° C (100° F) or below -12° C (10° F) seldom occur over most of this species range. Average annual rainfall within the natural range of redbay varies from a low of 1020 mm (40 in) in southern Delaware increasing to about 1320 mm (52 in) along the Atlantic coast of Florida and reaches a maximum of 1630 mm (64 in) in several areas along the gulf coast. Rainfall is quite well distributed, with about 55 percent of the total annual rainfall occurring in the warm season (April through September). Periodic summer droughts are more common in the western part than in the rest of this species range (9).",Climate,Redbay,persea,borbonia,hardwood,2,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- The flowers are perfect, appearing in the spring in the axils of the new foliage. Insects, primarily bees, are the principal pollination vector; however, pollen is also disseminated by wind. The fruit is a small drupe about 13 mm (0.5 in) long that is bright blue or blue-black when ripe. A thin layer of rather dry flesh surrounds the seed or pit of the fruit (4). Seed Production and Dissemination- Redbay produces annual crops of fruits. Seeds are disseminated mainly by several forms of wildlife, including songbirds, white-tailed deer, bobwhite, wild turkey, and black bear. No direct information is available on size of the seed but based upon drupes of similar size from Nyssa, it is estimated that there are approximately 4,630 seeds per kilogram (2,100/lb). Seedling Development- Germination of redbay seed is hypogeal. No further information on seedling development was available. Vegetative Reproduction- No information on vegetative reproduction of redbay could be found in the literature.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Redbay,persea,borbonia,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Redbay is included in a list of commercial trees of southern hardwood forests, but its growth or the size it attains varies considerably over its range. Presumably these differences in growth are a reflection of variation in site quality (8). One source (4) describes redbay as a beautiful evergreen tree, sometimes 18 to 21 m (60 to 70 ft) in height and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in diameter. Under forest growth conditions it develops a clear, cylindrical bole and a dense, pyramidal crown with ascending branches. A second source (3) describes redbay as a small evergreen tree seldom more than 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft) tall with a trunk diameter of 31 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in). Redbay found growing in the pocosins along the Atlantic Coast has been described as a shrub. Rooting Habit- Information pertaining to this aspect of the life history of redbay could not be found in the literature. Reaction to Competition- Redbay is classed as tolerant of shade but is also found growing well in the open, and in both young and old forest stands. Reproduction is generally erratic and scattered in groups among swamp tupelo and sweetbay. Overstory competition may account for the scarcity and poor form of redbay growing under certain forest conditions (8). Damaging Agents- Fire may cause substantial damage to redbay. Fire scarring with the associated deterioration of the butt portion of the tree is common. It may also prevent or forestall the establishment of reproduction. Insects or diseases apparently do not cause serious damage to redbay. It is the principal host of Trioza magnoliae, a psyllid or jumping plant louse. This psyllid forms large, unsightly galls on redbay leaves but apparently causes little damage to the tree because a large proportion of the leaves remain unaffected (6). A leaf spot of redbay caused by the fungus Phyllachora perseae has been reported. Evidently this disease is not a serious problem because only a portion of the leaf area is affected (5). Although some species of the genus Persea are susceptible to a root disease caused by the fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi, redbay is resistant. This resistance is due to a borbonol, a preformed antifungal substance that is a component of the roots and stems of certain species of Persea. Some species of this genus, including several avocado cultivars highly susceptible to this root disease, do not contain antifungal compounds with the properties of borbonol (10).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Redbay,persea,borbonia,hardwood,14,0
"Redbay is found growing on the borders of swamps and swampy drains in the rich, moist, mucky soil of the lower Coastal Plain. Such muck swamps are not of alluvial origin but generally originate from impoundment of water in land-locked depressions. The water of these swamps is usually dark brown from accumulated organic matter. The bottoms of the swamps do not provide firm support. Sites similar to the deep muck swamps are found in the shallow ponds, strands, and pocosins in the longleaf, slash, and pond pine woods but here tree growth is usually stunted (8). These soils are most commonly found in the order Histosols.",Soils and Topography,Redbay,persea,borbonia,hardwood,15,0
"The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and bright red, with a thin, lighter colored sapwood, but it has no established place in commerce. It is used locally for cabinet making and interior finish and for boatbuilding. Dried leaves of redbay make an excellent substitute for those of the tropical bay and may be used in the same way for seasoning food. The tree is occasionally used as an ornamental because of the evergreen leaves and its fruit. Redbay is reported to be of significant importance to wildlife. The fruit is eaten by several species of songbirds and wild turkey. In order of volumetric importance, the redbay fruits were in 15th place in a list of 63 food items. Redbay seeds may form a sizable portion of the bobwhite diet during the fall and winter months. The fruits and leaves of redbay are eaten by deer. It is browsed heaviest in fall and winter but withstands such grazing well. As much as 40 percent of the annual growth has been removed as browse for 2- or 3-year periods without causing death of the plants. Reports that black bear consume both the fruits and leaves of redbay have been noted in North Carolina and Florida (2).",Special Uses,Redbay,persea,borbonia,hardwood,16,0
"Redwood is a principal species in only one forest cover type, Redwood (Society of American Foresters Type 232) (42), but is found in three other Pacific Coast types, Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229), Port-Orford-Cedar (Type 231), and Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234). Pure stands of redwood are found only on some of the best sites, usually the moist river flats and gentle slopes below 305 m (1,000 ft). Although redwood is a dominant tree throughout its range, generally it is mixed with other conifers and broad-leaf trees. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is well distributed throughout most of the redwood type. Distributions of other conifer associates are more limited. Significant species on the coastal side of the redwood type are grand fir (Abies grandis) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) north from northern Sonoma County, CA, and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) north from the vicinity of Humboldt Bay, CA. Conifers associated less commonly on the coastal side of the redwood type are Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and California torreya (Torreya californica). Other conifers found with redwood include Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana) and several species of pine, including bishop pine (Pinus muricata), knobcone pine (P. attenuata), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), Monterey pine (P. radiata), and sugar pine (P. lambertiana). The two hardwoods most abundant and generally distributed in the redwood region are tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii). Other hardwoods found with redwood include vine maple (Acer circinatum), bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum), red alder (Alnus rubra), giant chinkapin (Castanopsis chrysophylla), Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), Pacific bayberry (Myrica californica), Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana), cascara buckthorn (Rhamnus purshiana), willows (Salix spp.), and California-laurel (Umbellularia californica). Of the great variety of lesser vegetation found in association with redwood, these species are especially common: bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. lanuginosum), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), salal (Gaultheria shallon), blueblossom (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus), California huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis), coyote-brush (Baccharis pilularis), and snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus).",Associated Forest Cover,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,1,1
"The mild climate of the redwood forest region can be classed broadly as super-humid or humid. Mean annual temperatures vary between 10° and 16° C (50° and 60° F). Differences between mean annual maximum and mean annual minimum temperatures vary from -12° C (10° F) for coastal points to -1° C (30° F) for the eastern edge of the redwood type. Temperatures rarely drop below -9° C (15° F) or rise above 38° C (100° F). The frost-free period varies from 6 to 11 months (34). Annual precipitation varies between 640 and 3100 mm (25 and 122 in) and is mostly winter rain, although snow sometimes covers the highest ridges. Generally, January is the wettest month and July is the driest. With substantial precipitation in all months except summer, only slight summer drought on deep soils, and mild winters, the climate is productive, and some of the world's grandest forests are indigenous to it (34). The frequent summer fogs that blanket the redwood region seem to be more significant than the amount of precipitation in delineating the redwood type. The major effect of fog is to decrease water loss from evaporation and transpiration. An additional effect of condensation and fog drip from tree crowns is an increased soil moisture supply during the dry summers (1). The natural range of redwood is limited to areas where heavy summer fogs from the ocean provide a humid atmosphere, although its successful growth in plantations or amenity plantings is not as limited. Redwood is among the most successful trees in the Central Valley of California, and at low elevations in the Sierra Nevada. It grows well at considerable distance from the ocean in New Zealand, France, Spain, and elsewhere (26,27).",Climate,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,2,1
"Sequoia is unique within Coniferales, being of a hexaploid nature (41). It was thought that redwood originated as an allopolyploid from hybrids between early Tertiary or Mesozoic species of Metasequoia and some extinct Taxodiaceous plant such as the modern giant sequoia. However, the types and numbers of marker chromosomes found in Metasequoia and Taxodium distichum are different than those present in Sequoia, making it unlikely that these species contributed to the polyploidy of Sequoia. Comparisons between the marker chromosomes in Sequoia and those in Sequoiadendron indicate that genomic contribution by Sequoiadendron to Sequoia is not probable (41). Races of redwood are not known, but the following cultivars (cultivated varieties) have been recognized (16): cv. 'Adpressa' Tips of shoots creamy white. Awl-like leaves. cv. 'Glauca' Leaves 6 mm (0.25 in) long, glaucous, bluish. cv. 'Nana Pendula' Leaves glaucous, branches pendulous. cv. 'Pendula' Branches pendulous. cv. 'Prostrata' Prostrate at first; leaves green, glaucous beneath. Four varieties of redwood now available in nurseries show a range of growth habits, texture, color, and form. They are named Aptos Blue, Los Altos, Soquel, and Santa Cruz (6). An uncommon form of redwood, the albino redwood, has been described in a few locations within the redwood region (17). These albinos result from a genetic disorder and exist by attachment to a normal green tree, generally at the roots. The tallest albino observed was 19.8 m (65 ft) tall. Albinism is often a useful trait in genetics research to determine mutation rate, and for other purposes. Preliminary results from studies of self and related outcross families indicate that, compared with outcrosses, selfing produced no additional cone abortion or variable effects on germination. Under stress conditions in nurseries and outplantings, some inbreeding depression becomes evident, and restricting inbreeding in redwood seed-orchards seems prudent (30). The tissue culture techniques described earlier also allow genetic manipulation of redwood at the cellular level. Possibilities being explored include the production of di-haploid redwood from female gametophyte cultures (2).",Genetics,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,7,1
"In Russia, hybridization of redwood with giant sequoia, bald cypress, and Japanese cryptomeria (Cryptomeria japonica) has been reported (38,39). Other attempts to develop a hybrid between coast redwood and giant sequoia by normal controlled-pollination crosses have failed (28). Cell fusion in culture may be used to create interspecific hybrids with giant sequoia or other species (28).",Hybrids,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,9,1
"The range of redwood extends southward from two groves on the Chetco River in the extreme southwest corner of Oregon (lat. 42° 09' N.), to Salmon Creek Canyon in the Santa Lucia Mountains of southern Monterey County, CA (lat. 35° 41' N.). This redwood belt is an irregular coastal strip about 724 km (450 mi) long and generally 8 to 56 km (5 to 35 mi) wide (39). Within this region, redwood trees grow now, or could grow, on an estimated 647 500 ha (1.6 million acres). Of this area, 260 200 ha (643,000 acres) comprise the commercial coast redwood forest type (more than 50 percent redwood stocking). The remainder of the area contains parks, other forest types containing redwood, and recently logged redwood type (12). The old-growth redwood, much of which is in State and National Parks, occupies less than 80 940 ha (200,000 acres) (36). The old-growth in commercial forests will be harvested within the next few decades. A major discontinuity splits the type in southern Humboldt County, CA. South of Sonoma County, CA, redwoods grow in detached and irregular areas to the southern extremity of the range (38,39). - The native range of redwood.",Native Range,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Redwood is monoecious; inconspicuous male and female flowers are borne separately on different branches of the same tree. The ovulate conelets grow into broadly oblong cones (10). Redwood female strobili become receptive and pollen sheds between late November and early March, although flowering usually is over by the end of January. Weather conditions during pollination may directly affect seed quality. Continuous rains during flowering wash pollen from the male strobili and little pollen may reach the receptive female strobili. Dry periods during pollination permit better pollen dispersal and improve seed viability. Redwood cones are terminal and are 13 to 29 mm (0.5 to 1.1 in) long. They mature in autumn of the first year after flowering and are open from early September until late December. Although cones persist for several months, they open and shed seeds soon after ripening. Seed Production and Dissemination- Redwoods start to bear seeds when 5 to 15 years old (8). One study showed that seed viability increased with the age of parent trees (38,39). Maximum seed viability was reached when trees were more than 250 years old. Seeds produced by trees younger than 20 years generally were less than 1 percent viable, and seeds from trees more than 1,200 years old were not more than 3 percent viable. Redwoods produce abundant seeds almost every year. Even trees in the intermediate crown class often produce seed crops. Fair to abundant crops were produced in 5 consecutive years in north coastal California (8). Cones often are rare, however, or nonexistent on large areas for many years in stands in Mendocino County, CA (central part of the range). Large mature stands on Maui, HI, have few or no cones or pollen (27). Trees with new, narrow crowns resulting from sprouting of dormant buds after fire has killed the crown produce few cones during the first 4 years after the fire. About one-half such narrow-crowned trees, locally called fire-columns, bear cones in the fifth year, and almost all produce cones by the seventh or eighth year. The germination rate of redwood seeds is usually low. Poor germination often results from a low percentage of sound seeds (less than 15 percent) rather than from dormancy. When obviously defective seeds are removed, germination rarely is below 80 percent, and is sometimes 100 percent (27). Identification of defective seeds often is difficult, however, because many seeds appearing sound are filled with tannin. In one seed study, soundness varied significantly with seed size. Seeds passing 12, 10, and 8 mesh screens were 2, 8, and 15 percent sound, respectively. Seeds from seven populations were photographed by X-ray. The distribution in categories was as follows: seeds empty or tannin filled, 58 to 97 percent; seeds from embryos damaged by fungi, 0 to 11 percent; and sound seeds, 1 to 32 percent (38,39). Although only scant evidence is recorded on storage of redwood seeds, they do not seem to store well. One seed lot was stored successfully for 3 years but lost its viability completely after 5 years (19). Redwood cones dry readily under conditions of low humidity and quickly release their seeds with slight shaking. But because weather conditions at cone ripening in nature usually are unfavorable for rapid drying, seed dispersal may be spread over periods that vary considerably in length. Rains, however, may hasten seed dissemination. One observer found in many instances that redwood seeds remained in the open cones until a drenching rain dissolved the tannic crystals in the cones (38,39). Seed dissemination during the winter months seems characteristic of redwood in the northern stands. More than four-fifths of the sound seeds in one study were shed during December and January. Redwood seeds are small and light, number about 265,000/kg (120,000/lb), but lack efficient wings to slow them in falling (10). They fall at rates between 1.5 and 6.2 m/s (4.9 and 20.5 ft/s), averaging 2.6 m/s (8.6 ft/s). These rates are faster than for most other wind-disseminated forest seeds and limit seed dispersal considerably. Timbered edges of clearcut units have effective seeding distances of only 61 m (200 ft) uphill and 122 m (400 ft) downhill under average redwood stand conditions. A recent study in Del Norte County, CA, showed that the largest clearcut units should not be more than 12 to 16 ha (30 to 40 acres) if regeneration will be completed by natural seeding (38,39). No silvicultural reasons exist for restricting the size of clearcuts, if areas are regenerated by artificial methods. Maximum size of clearcuttings is specified in Forest Practice Rules, based on erosion hazard, or other criteria. Seedling Development- Redwood seeds, generally, are ready to germinate soon after they fall to the ground if seedbeds are moist and the weather is warm enough. Redwood seeds do not require pretreatment to germinate, but germination speed is increased by an overnight soak in aerated water (27). Mineral soil is the best seedbed, but seeds will germinate readily in duff, on logs, in debris, or under other vegetation, and in either shade or full sunlight if adequate soil moisture is available. Redwood seed germination is epigeal. New redwood seedlings require a greater supply of soil moisture for survival than that needed by seedlings of most associated trees (19). Late spring and early fall rains can be critical survival factors. Apparently, redwoods have no root hairs. Consequently, redwood roots do not seem to function efficiently in extracting soil moisture. This fact may limit natural distribution to sites where favorable water relations result from high rainfall, humid air, moist soil, or low summer temperatures, or from various combinations of these conditions. Redwood seedlings on fully exposed soil can withstand considerable surface heat if their roots have reached a permanent moisture supply. Otherwise, they die before soil surface temperatures reach 60° C (140° F). Redwood seedlings are extremely vulnerable to infection by damping-off and Botrytis fungi during their first year (22). In its early stages, redwood grows rapidly in height. Seedlings often grow about 46 cm (18 in) in the first season and trees 4 to 10 years old sometimes grow 0.6 to 2.0 m (2 to 6.5 ft) in a year. In many instances, however, rapid height growth of trees that originate from seed does not commence until the trees are more than 10 years old. Juvenile growth of redwood is best in full sunlight. Although redwood seedlings can endure heavy shade, growth there is slow. Photosynthetic capacity in redwood is remarkably high at low light intensities and keeps increasing as light intensity increases, much like more intolerant species. Redwood grew vigorously in much weaker light than 12 other tree species studied (38,39). For example, it increased its size 8.8 times in 10 percent of full sunlight in a 9-month period, more than twice the growth of any of the other species in the test. For appreciable growth, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and Douglas-fir require twice as much light as redwood. Pine requires three to four times as much. Radial growth of redwood in Mendocino County, CA, at points 6, 14, and 32 km (4, 9, and 20 mi) from the coast did not vary markedly in growth pattern. Radial growth began after mid-March, increased to a maximum in late May, and then declined at a fairly uniform rate to a minimum at the end of September. Radial growth was negligible from October 1 to March 15. Vegetative Reproduction- Redwood can be propagated by cuttings, but few large-scale attempts of this kind have been reported. In an early study in California, 40 percent of the cuttings from the tops of fast-growing seedlings that had been pushed into forest nursery soil with no special treatment developed root systems (38,39). Currently, rooting in excess of 90 percent is obtained routinely, with mist in a favorable medium, using juvenile cuttings from seedlings (27). Cuttings from older trees are more difficult to root. Studies in the past 10 years have improved the cutting procedure by hedging-a technique that seems to maintain the juvenility of the donor tree. A single seedling and its clonal descendants can produce about 1 million cuttings in 3 years by repeated hedging of seedlings and their descendants (29). Modern methods of plant tissue culture also have propagated redwood successfully (3). Tissues from outstanding mature trees may be cultured in nutrient medium, becoming undifferentiated masses of cells or callus. In different nutrient media, fragments of the callus can be induced to differentiate into small plants. When these plants become large enough, juvenile cuttings can be taken from them (30). In France, scientists have found that shoots of redwood 10 to 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long are the best reactive material for producing explants, with fragments of the annual shoots being more reactive than the annual sprouts of 2-year-old shoots (13). Tissue cultured plantlets are generally twice the size of seedlings of the same age (2). Redwood can sprout from stumps and root crowns anytime of the year. Numerous and vigorous sprouts originate from both dormant and adventitious buds within 2 to 3 weeks after logging. Sprouting capacity is related to variables associated with tree size or age. Stumps of small young trees sprout more readily than those of large old trees (35). Stumps often are circled by more than 100 sprouts. Many sprouts may be necessary to sustain a healthy stump-root system (4,15). Powers and Wiant (37) found that sprout vigor was related to sprout density. Sprout vigor was reduced at densities less than one sprout per 2 feet of stump circumference. Each sprout soon develops its own root system, and in a remarkably short time the dominant sprouts create circles of new trees around the old stumps. Depending on the intensity of thinning or partial cutting in redwood, sprouts grow and develop successfully in openings (11,31). A recent study showed that more than 90 percent of all redwood stumps sprouted in a 40-year-old redwood stand thinned to 25, 50, and 75 percent of the initial basal area. Consequently, all thinned stands contained several hundred redwood sprout clumps per acre, and several thousand individual sprouts. The heavier the thinning, the more sprouts developed into vigorous young crop trees (31). Sprouting by redwood is principally from root crowns, but sprouts sometimes grow from the sides and tops of stumps. These high sprouts are less desirable because they are mechanically weak and not as vigorous as root-crown sprouts. Sprouts originating from the sides and top of stumps often are destroyed by strong wind. Sprouts are commonly about 60 to 90 cm (24 to 36 in) tall at the end of the first year but may be more than 1.8 m (6 ft) tall. In one instance, a fire killed all sprouts around a stump. About 300 new sprouts appeared within a few days, and at the end of one growing season many reached 2.1 m (7 ft). Sprouts grow more rapidly than seedlings and the initial impetus lasts many years. However, the best phenotypes at age 40 to 80 in stands originating from both sprouts and seedlings often are found to be of seedling origin (27). Early estimates of stocking from root crown sprouts varied from 20 to 35 percent of full stocking. A later study showed that redwood sprouts on old growth cutover redwood land in Mendocino and Humboldt Counties, CA, provided only 8 percent of full stocking. This finding is low compared to more recent stand examinations where the majority of redwood stems in 163 moderately to fully stocked young growth stands originated from sprouts (33). Redwood can also sprout along almost the entire length of its trunk. If the crown of a tree is destroyed by fire or mechanically damaged, or the stem is suddenly exposed to light, numerous dormant buds along the trunk are stimulated and produce new foliage. Most of the trunk is then covered by feathery foliage extending 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) from the trunk. Eventually, normal crowns develop again.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Redwood is long lived, grows taller than any other tree species in the world, and is exceeded in bulk only by the giant sequoia. Redwoods are sexually mature at 10 years or less but continue to increase in volume for centuries. The oldest redwood found so far, determined by growth ring counts, is nearly 2,200 years old. Old-growth redwood forests sometimes are incorrectly called even-aged and overmature when, in fact, few forests in the world can match many redwood stands in range of ages and mixture of vigorously growing and decadent trees. Redwood probably is best known for its great size, although the average redwood is smaller than commonly believed. Trees larger than 30 cm (12 in) in d.b.h. on a 12-ha (30-acre) old-growth tract in Humboldt County, CA, fell approximately into these divisions: 30 to 77 cm (12 to 30 in) in d.b.h., 50 percent; 78 to 153 cm (31 to 60 in), 32 percent; 155 cm (61 in) and larger, 18 percent. Redwoods 366 to 488 cm. (144 to 192 in) in d.b.h., found scattered over the entire range, are considered large. Trees 610 cm (240 in) or more in diameter at a point 1.5 m (5 ft) above the ground are rare. Redwoods more than 61 m (200 ft) tall are common, and many trees growing on riverside benches, where soils are deep and moist, are taller than 91 m (300 ft). The tallest measured redwood was 112.1 m (367.8 ft) in 1964 (50). Large trees and dense stocking combine to produce high yields. More than 81 percent of the commercial redwood forest land is classified as highly productive, and only 2 percent is poor for growing trees. Flats along rivers have yielded approximately 10,500 to 14,000 m³/ha (about 750,000 to 1,000,000 fbm/acre) in scaled logs. Harvest cuttings in Del Norte County, CA, on units of 5.3 ha (13 acres) and larger, produced gross volumes ranging from 1330 to 3921 m³/ha (95,000 to 280,000 fbm/acre, Scribner). Biomass accumulates to record levels. A redwood stand in Humboldt State Park in California provides the greatest biomass ever recorded, with a stem biomass of 3461 t/ha (1,544 tons/acre) (20). Economical conversion of old-growth redwood to young managed stands by shelterwood or selection cutting is difficult because net growth is negative during the decade after logging. Windthrow, slow growth of residual trees, and damage to established reproduction when residual trees are removed contribute to economic losses. Considering effect on growth, small clearcuttings seem to be a good method for converting old-growth redwood to young managed stands (9). Young-growth redwood is often nearly as spectacular in size and yield as old growth. Dominant young-growth trees on good sites are 30.5 to 45.7 m (100 to 150 ft) tall at 50 years, and 50.3 to 67.1 m (165 to 220 ft) at 100 years. Height growth is most rapid up to the 35th year. On the best sites, however, height growth continues to be rapid well past 100 years (24,33). Diameter growth of individual young trees can be rapid or extremely slow. In dense stands where competition is severe, annual diameter increment is commonly less than 1 mm (0.03 in). Occasionally, 40 or more rings per centimeter (more than 100/in) can be counted. At the other extreme, diameter growth sometimes exceeds 2.5 cm (1 in) a year. One redwood growing with little competition was 213 cm (84 in) in d.b.h. when 108 years old. The yield of young-growth redwood stands at 100 years is expected to range from 742 m³/ha (10,600 ft³/acre) on low sites to 3576 m³/ha (51,080 ft³/acre) on high sites (32). The same stands yield 781 to 4998 m³/ha (55,760 to 357,000 fbm/acre International quarter-inch rule), and yields of more than 2800 m³/ha (about 200,000 fbm/acre International quarter-inch rule) are common in young-growth redwood stands. At earlier ages, however, the greatest yields are in stands that contain a mixture of redwood and Douglas-fir (25). Natural pruning in young redwood stands often is not good. Although live crowns may be limited to the upper third of the trunk, dead limbs are persistent. Branch stubs, although decayed, may remain more than 50 years. In old trees, some branch stubs have affected the quality of the timber over a 200-year period. Trees in the intermediate crown class, however, often prune well naturally, and some trees in a heavily stocked stand have clean trunks for 23 to 30 m (75 to 100 ft) at 85 years. Rooting Habit- Redwoods have no taproots, but lateral roots are large and wide-spreading. Small trees have better-than-average windfirmness, and large redwoods are windfirm under most conditions. A study in extreme northwestern California indicated that a combination of wet soil and strong winds is necessary for significant windfall damage. Consequently, windfall is caused by only a few of the many winter storms. Storms that cause windfall come mainly from the south. Uprooting accounted for 80 percent of the redwood windfall in this study (7). Reaction to Competition- The redwood forest is a climax type. When growing with other species, redwood usually is a dominant tree. Douglas-fir can keep pace with redwood on many sites and occupy dominant and codominant crown positions along with redwood. Redwood has been classed as tolerant or very tolerant, the two highest categories in a scale of five shade tolerance classes. It is probably most accurately classed as very tolerant of shade in most situations. Redwood stands are dense. At 60 years, redwood may have a basal area of more than 126 m²/ha (550 ft²/acre) on the best sites (32). Heavy stocking is desirable because the relatively high tolerance permits land to support a large number of dominant and codominant trees per unit area. Under some conditions, redwood can endure suppression almost indefinitely. A 25-cm (10-in) suppressed tree might be more than 100 years old. Small trees may be suppressed for more than 400 years but still maintain a remarkable capacity to accelerate growth rates when released if they have not been crowded too closely and are not injured seriously during logging or slash burning. Large trees also can accelerate growth when released from competition. Damaging Agents- Fire is the principal damaging agent in both young-growth and old-growth stands. The above-ground portions of young stands may be killed outright by a single ground fire, but the stands sprout and reoccupy the site. Fires are especially damaging to trees less than 20 years old because their thin bark does not protect them. Also, more flammable litter lies on the ground, and the microclimate is drier than under old-growth forest. Old-growth redwood stands show evidence of three or more severe fires each century (23,44). In many instances, fires may only reduce the thickness of the protective bark, which may be more than 30 cm (12 in) thick. In other instances, fires cause basal wounds through which heart rots enter. The combination of recurring fires and advancing decay produces large basal cavities called ""goose pens."" In extreme instances, mature trees may be so weakened mechanically that they fall. In its northern range, in and around Redwood National Park, CA, fire has a moderate ecological role in redwood stands. Light ground fires that do not open the canopy favor western hemlock regeneration but usually eliminate older hemlock from the stand. Douglas-fir establishment is infrequent and unsuccessful under a full overstory canopy, even following light ground fires on mesic sites. Relatively hot fires appear essential for the establishment of Douglas-fir trees in discrete age classes. Redwood, grand fir, and tanoak maintain their status in redwood stands with and without the influence of fire (47,48). Frequency distributions of fires indicate a natural pattern of several short intervals between fires followed by one or more long interval. This suggests that prescribed burning to maintain ecosystems should also be done on a short-short-long interval pattern (23). Redwood has no tree-killing diseases other than seedling diseases previously listed, but heart rots cause extensive cull. Most common heart rot in the southern part of the range of redwood is a brown cubical rot, caused by Poria sequoiae. Most significant farther north is a white ring rot caused by P. albipellucida (5,22). A twig branch canker (Coryneum spp.) has been observed on sprouts and plantation trees of seedling and sapling size. This canker, which girdles stems and branches, could become damaging in plantations (5,22). Several insects are found on redwood but none cause significant damage. These include a flatheaded twig borer and girdler (Anthaxia aeneogaster), two redwood bark beetles (Phloeosinus sequoiae and P. cristatus), and the sequoia pitch moth (Vespamima sequoiae) (21). Bark stripping by the American black bear has caused serious damage in some parts of the redwood region. Wide strips of bark are ripped from the tree, often from the top to the ground, during April to August. Trees 10 to 30 years old and 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) in diameter are damaged most and many may be girdled. Woodrats often injure planted trees on cutover land and occasionally attack sprouts and larger trees. In a few instances, redwood is deformed by fasciation, a flattening of the normally cylindrical stem by formation of a row of linked meristems. The causes of most fasciations are unknown (40).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,14,1
"The parent rock material of the redwood region is largely massive marine sandstone formed in the Tertiary and Upper Mesozoic periods. Considerable shale and lesser amounts of Mesozoic limestones and Franciscan slates, cherts, limestones, and sandstones also are present, and schists are fairly common in some localities. High-site soils for redwood consist of Xerochrepts, Haploxerults, and Haplohumults of the Hugo, Josephine, Melbourne, Empire, Sites, and Larabee series (orders Inceptisols and Ultisols) and associated alluvial soils. The high-site residual soils have been derived from either consolidated or soft sedimentary rocks. In the Coastal Forest Practice Act District of California, which encompasses the natural range of redwood, the Hugo soil series predominates. In current soil taxonomic terms, the Hugo series is a Typic Distrochrept of the order Inceptisols (45,46). It is a member of a loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic family, typically pale brown, moderately acid, gravelly (sandy) clay loam A horizons, and pale brown, strongly acid gravelly (sandy) clay loam B horizons. Limits of redwood forests sometimes are determined by soil types. For example, redwood does not grow on soils having high amounts of magnesium and sodium. Fertility of soils under redwood stands has been studied by measuring the replaceable calcium concentration, expressed in equivalents, present in a square meter (10.76 ft²) to a depth of 30 cm (12 in). This measure indicates fertility best because it separates nutritional properties from other environmental effects. Equivalents ranged from 4 to more than 80, with 63 appearing to be optimum (49). Soil nutrient levels that were observed to change during harvest of old-growth or second-growth redwood recovered to nearly original values during regrowth. In the one-meter soil profile, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium and sodium increased in amount, while calcium decreased (52). Soil organic matter showed a small decline and recovery after logging (18). The lowest amount of soil moisture available during the year has been related to minimum basal area growth of redwood stands. Basal area is used as an index of stand development. This minimum available soil moisture, expressed as a percentage of storage capacity, ranged between 18 and 86, with 62 correlated with maximum basal area (49). The redwood region, generally, is characterized by irregular ridges oriented northwest to southeast with deep narrow valleys. Consequently, the principal streams drain to the northwest. Much of the terrain is rough, steep, and extremely dissected both by major streams and smaller drainages. Redwoods grow from sea level to about 915 m (3,000 ft) elevation, but most are found between 30 and 760 m (100 and 2,500 ft). The best stands have developed on flats and benches along the larger streams, on moist coastal plains, river deltas, moderate westerly slopes, and valleys opening toward the sea. Although most redwood stands are close to the ocean, redwood does not tolerate ocean winds, and considerable evidence suggests that it is sensitive to ocean salts carried inland during storms. Usually redwoods do not grow on hillsides that face the ocean. The absence of redwood near the ocean also may be caused by the absence of forest soils of sufficient depth and fertility to support redwood. Redwoods are smaller and give way to other species as altitude, dryness, and slope increase. In the north, redwoods clothe all exposures and reach their maximum development as forest trees. In the southern part of the range, redwoods are restricted to western or northern exposures, and at the extreme southern extension they are restricted almost entirely to the bottoms of narrow canyons that cut through steep foothills abutting the ocean. Trees near the mouths of these canyons often are exposed to onshore winds and frequently have flat tops with dead limbs on the windward side. This effect has been attributed to the trees' inability to replace moisture lost through desiccation by winds. On alluvial flats, where redwoods reach their maximum development, soils have been built up by deposits of sediment from successive floods. In one area the ground level has been raised 3.4 m (11 ft) in 700 years. In another, repeated flooding in the past 1,000 years deposited nearly 9.1 m (30 ft) of silt and gravel around the bases of many large redwood trees. Deposits from a single flood have been as deep as 76 cm (30 in). Redwoods adapt to the new ground levels by originating new and higher root systems (43,51). This flooding generally kills competing species and thereby allows redwood to maintain nearly pure stands on such plains.",Soils and Topography,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,15,1
"Redwood is used where decay resistance is important. Clark and Scheffer (14) found that decay resistance varied among trees or within the heartwood of individual trees. Decay resistance decreased from outer to inner hardwood. Wood classified as very decay resistant was about five times more prevalent in old-growth than in young-growth trees. A prominent special feature of the redwood is its production of burls from which beautifully figured table tops, veneers, bowls, and other turned products are cut. These burls are found on any part of the trunk and in sizes varying from an inch to many feet in diameter. Their cause is unknown. Small burls containing hundreds of dormant buds often are cut and placed in shallow containers, kept moist, and allowed to sprout. These live burls serve as attractive house plants. Another feature of redwood is its extremely tough and fibrous bark. The bark must be removed before logs reach the head saws so that sawing uniform lumber will be possible. The bark is used as hog fuel, insulation, or garden mulch.",Special Uses,Redwood,sequoia,sempervirens,conifer,16,1
"There are few genetic studies of river birch but parent trees from Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky varied randomly in leaf and seed characteristics. Their progenies also varied in leaf traits, and first-year seedling height was correlated with annual diameter growth of the parent trees (12). Texas stands varied significantly in wood specific gravity, and the variation was correlated with diameter growth. Single-tree progenies also varied significantly in height growth (6). Thus, it appears possible to increase both growth and specific gravity of river birch by selecting for fast diameter growth. Natural hybrids between river birch and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) have been reported but have never been verified and appear unlikely because interspecific hybridization involving river birch is very difficult. River birch has been crossed with sweet birch (B. lenta), gray birch (B. populifolia), paper birch (B. papyrifera), resin birch (B. glandulosa), and low birch (B. pumila var. glandulifera) and with the following introduced species: B. ermani Cham., B. raddeana Trautv., B. pendula Roth, B. pubescens Ehrh., B. platyphylla Sukachev, and B. maximowicziana Regel. Seed yield and viability have been low and growth has been poor. In general, crossing attempts are more likely to succeed if river birch is the female parent (2).",Genetics,River Birch,betula,nigra,hardwood,7,0
"The primary range of river birch is the southeastern quarter of the United States from eastern Texas and southeastern Iowa to Virginia and northern Florida. Scattered populations are found along rivers and streams as far north as southern Minnesota, central Wisconsin, and the middle New England States (8). Its northern limit in the Great Lakes region corresponds to the boundary of the terminal moraine of the Wisconsin glacier (7). Major exclusions within the primary range are the southern half of the Mississippi River flood plain, the lower coastal plain, the Appalachian Mountains, and limestone areas of southern Missouri, central Tennessee, and central Kentucky. In western North Carolina, river birch is found primarily below 550 m (1,800 ft) elevation but has been found as high as 670 m (2,205 ft) (17). Mountainous exclusions may be related to the scarcity of alluvium along streams at higher elevations and faster current streams that sweep seeds downstream (7). - The native range of river birch. With its geographic range encompassing almost the eastern half of the United States, river birch grows throughout a wide range of climate. It is most abundant in the hot, humid Southeast where the frost-free season averages from 210 to 270 days and annual rainfall averages about 1270 mm (50 in). At the northern extreme of its range in Minnesota and Wisconsin, annual precipitation averages less than 760 mm (30 in) and the frost-free season is 150 days or less (8). Although river birch is primarily a plant of alluvial soils (Entisols), it occasionally becomes established on dry soils. The western limit of its range coincides roughly with the eastern boundary of the prairie soils. A study in North Carolina indicated a positive correlation of total clays with presence of river birch stands. The same study found that the tree not only tolerated high soil moisture but also required soils that maintain soil moisture near field capacity yearlong (17). Despite its affinity for water, river birch is only moderately resistant to flooding, a characteristic that may account for its absence on much of the Mississippi River flood plain. Its high tolerance for acid soils is illustrated in Ohio, where it is the primary invader and dominant on stream bottoms made too acid (pH 2 to 4) for other bottom-land trees by coal mine drainage (10). As river birch is primarily a streambank tree, a list of its associates includes practically all bottomland plants in the eastern half of the United States. Published lists of associated plants from several states provide an east-to-west cross section of the range of river birch. Individual lists are from specific areas, however, and may not be representative of the state as a whole. Associates reported from more than one state are listed below (N = North Carolina, O = Ohio, I = Illinois, M = Missouri): sycamore -- Platanus occidentalis (N,O,I,M) red maple -- Acer rubrum (N,O,I) silver maple -- Acer saccharinum (O,I,M) black willow -- Salix nigra (N,O,I) hazel alder -- Alnus serrulata (N,O,I) American hornbeam -- Carpinus caroliniana (N,O) honeylocust -- Gleditsia triacanthos (O,I) yellow-poplar -- Liriodendron tulipifera (N,O) black tupelo -- Nyssa syluatica (O,I) black cherry -- Prunus serotina (N,O) American elm -- Ulmus americana (O,I) Other associated species include sugar maple (Acer saccharum), boxelder (Acer negundo), yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), water hickory (Carya aquatica), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), mockernut hickory (C. tomentosa), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), swamp-privet (Forestiera acuminata), ash (Fraxinus spp.), Carolina silverbell (Halesia carolina), water-elm (Planera aquatica), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), swamp cottonwood (Populusheterophylla), swamp white oak Quercus bicolor), overcup oak (Q. lyrata), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), swamp chestnut oak Q. michauxii), pin oak (Q. palustris), northern red oak (Q. rubra), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), and American basswood Tilia americana). A forest cover type, River Birch-Sycamore (Society of American Foresters Type 61), has been described as growing along streams or lake shores with several of the associated species named above. River birch also is listed with associated vegetation in Cottonwood (Type 63) and Sycamore-Sweetgum-American Elm (Type 94) but undoubtedly occurs in most bottom-land types within its range (4).",Habitat,River Birch,betula,nigra,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- River birch is monoecious; separate male and female flowers are on the same plants. Clusters of poll en-producing male (staminate) catkins are formed at twig tips in fall and mature in April or May of the following year. Pollen production is abundant (birch pollen is a heavy contributor to the hay fever problem) (13). Female (pistillate) seed-producing catkins are borne on spur-shoots and appear with the leaves. The flowers open in early spring and the fruit matures in late spring or early summer. It is the only birch that does not produce seed in fall. Good seed crops occur almost every year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds of river birch are the largest of all the birches native to the United States, averaging 826,700/kg (375,000/lb). Each seed is about 4 mm (0. 15 in) long by 3 mm (0. 12 in) wide, excluding the wings. The small, winged seeds are transported by wind or by the streams along which river birch grows most abundantly. Seeds germinate rapidly in moist alluvial soil and often form thickets on sandbars. Seeds can be collected by picking or stripping the ""cones"" (strobili) while they are still green enough to prevent shattering. Seeds are removed by flailing and screening or fanning. Seedling Development- Germination of river birch seeds is best (about 35 percent) with unstratified seeds under artificial light (1). Germination is epigeal. During early stages, seedlings are fast-growing and have a high soil-moisture requirement. Because of abundant seed production, rapid germination, and vigorous early growth, river birch is one of the pioneer species of new forests growing on stream bank alluvium (17). Germination and development, as well as growth at all stages, is inhibited by even moderate shade (3). Despite the high moisture requirement of seedlings, river birch can tolerate flooding no more than 3 months during the growing season (14). Stumps of young trees sprout vigorously (5). Vegetative Reproduction- No information available. Growth and Yield- Information on growth and yield of river birch is scarce because most commercial use of the tree comes from natural stands, and wood of river birch is combined with that of other birches, beech, and maples (3). The clear bole is relatively short, with several ascending major branches arising from 4.6 to 6.1 m (15 to 20 ft) above the ground. Multiple stems, probably originating from stump sprouts, are common and tend to have basal sweep. In the lower Mississippi River Valley, isolated trees attain heights of 30.5 m (100 ft) and diameters of 150 cm (60 in). Average merchantable size, however, is 15.2 to 24.4 m (50 to 80 ft) tall and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. In Ohio, 58-year-old river birches grown in plantations average 23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 in) in d.b.h. and 15.5 m (51 ft) tall. Trees of the same age grown in the open with no competition from other trees are 58 to 76 cm (23 to 30 in) in d.b.h. and 15.2 to 19.8 m (50 to 65 ft) tall (11). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- River birch is most commonly classed as intolerant of shade. This characteristic precludes uneven-aged management of the species, although no record has been found of commercial planting for wood production. Thick natural stands often stagnate at an early age; nearly 20,000 3-month-old seedlings were counted in a 3.3 m² (36 ft²) plot on a Mississippi River bottom in Wisconsin (7). Damaging Agents- Floods and floating ice periodically destroy or damage young riverbank stands of river birch, but young trees are usually free of serious disease. Anthracnose leaf blight caused by the fungus Gloeosporium betularum is the principal leaf disease. Christmas mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum) is a common pest in the South because of the tree's preference for low, wet sites. It is usually disease-free unless old or damaged (5). Although river birch is host to several species of insects, it has no serious insect pests.",Life History,River Birch,betula,nigra,hardwood,10,0
"River birch is used mainly for local enterprises such as the manufacture of inexpensive furniture, basket hoops, and turned articles. Experiments in North Carolina did not indicate that it is desirable for commercial pulpwood production, but naturally occurring merchantable-sized trees are often harvested for pulpwood when mixed with other bottomland hardwoods. Strength of the wood makes it suitable for the manufacture of artificial limbs and children's toys. As the wood weighs about 560 kg/m³ (35 lb/ft³), it is somewhat lighter than commercially important birches (3). Because of its tolerance to acid soils, river birch has been used successfully in strip mine reclamation. It has also been used in erosion control (13). Its graceful form, attractive bark, and high resistance to the bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius) make it desirable for ornamental planting, especially in the Northeastern and Midwestern States. Young bark varies in color from silvery gray to light reddish brown or cinnamon colored and is lustrous with darker, narrow, longitudinal lenticels. Bark on fast-growing young trees may peel into papery strips. On older trees, bark on branches may be gray, smooth, and shiny; on the main trunk it may vary from dark reddish brown to gray or almost black with inch-thick irregular scales (fig. 3). Seeds are sometimes eaten by birds and the foliage is browsed by white-tailed deer (15).",Special Uses,River Birch,betula,nigra,hardwood,16,0

Temperature ranges from a mean minimum in January of 16° C (61° F) to a mean maximum of 31° C (88° F) in August (5). Potential evapotranspiration over the same regions varies between 1400 and 1900 mm (55 and 75 in) annually, with the lowest measurements in the mountainous interior. Throughout the West Indies, roble is found predominately in areas where the annual rainfall varies between about 1000 and 2500 mm (39 and 98 in) (table 1). All sites are frost free.",Climate,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,2,0
"Tabebuia heterophylla is a variable species that has been classified into subspecies, or related species, by several authors. Synonyms considered by some as varieties include T.pallida (Lindl.) Miers and T. dominguensis Urban (18). Roble in Puerto Rico typically has five leaflets. In dry areas and coastal thickets in the Lesser Antilles, trees are shorter, fruits and seeds smaller, and leaflet number declines to three, or at times to a single leaflet. Another variation found in Guadeloupe, Dominica, and Martinique has a single, broadly elliptic leaf (16).",Genetics,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,7,0
"The mature roble in Puerto Rico is easily identified by its opposite, palmately compound leaves, furrowed bark, and narrow, columnar crown. It is a small- to medium-size tree attaining a height of 18 In (60 ft) and a diameter of 60 cm (25 in). In the seedling and sapling stages, roble is an aggressive pioneer.",Life History,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,10,0
"Roble is native to Puerto Rico and widely distributed through the West Indies from Hispaniola to Grenada and Barbados. It is also naturalized in Bermuda and planted in southern Florida (16). In Puerto Rico, it is widespread in abandoned pastures and secondary forests and found in dry or wet natural forests, except for the highest elevations in the Luquillo Mountains and the Cordillera Central. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, roble is particularly common in dry, coastal woodlands and in secondary forests.",Native Range,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Large white to light purple perfect flowers are borne few to several in terminal and lateral clusters, or occasionally as individuals. In Puerto Rico, flowering is chiefly in the spring, or dry season, and is accompanied by complete leaf drop (11,16). Sporadic flowering occurs at other times. Fruits are borne in May and June with fruit fall varying from July through September. Mature fruits, dark brown cigarlike pods, may be found on the tree during most of the year (16). At 55 randomly placed collection stations comprised of 0.5 m² (5.4 ft²) screen baskets in the Subtropical Wet Forest of Puerto Rico, roble dropped 39 fruits in 39 months. Of the 38 species observed, roble ranked 37th in the number of fruits collected (11). Seed Production and Dissemination- The fruits are pods, about 8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) long and 6.5 mm (0.25 in) in diameter. The pods contain many winged seeds each about 2 cm (0.79 in) long. The capsule splits along two lines and seeds are dispersed varying distances from the parent tree, ranging up to 100 m (330 ft) or more, depending upon weather conditions. Dispersal is by wind. The seeds germinate in open areas and form dense stands of seedlings. Several seed experiments were conducted at the Institute of Tropical Forestry during the mid-1940's. About 70,000 air-dried seeds were counted per kilogram (31,750/lb), and these had a mean moisture content of 31 percent, based on the dry weight of the seeds. Seeds sown directly in seedbeds after collection in the field showed germination rates of 90 percent within 2 weeks. A 3-week delay in sowing seeds reduced viability to about 55 percent and after 5 weeks, no seeds germinated. Attempts were made to store seeds for long periods using seed moisture contents of 100, 75, 50, and 25 percent at room temperature and at 4' C (40' F). The best germination after 25 months, nearly 55 percent, was attained with the lowest moisture content and temperature combination. Seedling Development- Germination of roble is epigeal. Experiments by staff of the Institute of Tropical Forestry established roble in two different regions by means of broadcast seeding, spot planting of seeds, and planting, on lands that had been burned, cleared in a swath 1 m (3.3 ft) wide, or planted without site treatment. Direct seeding proved unsuccessful. The nursery stock survived, although the seedlings suffered dieback and did not recover for 6 to 8 months. Site treatment did not influence survival because grass grew quickly on all areas under study and competed with the transplants. The seedlings, after recovery, grew slowly. Transplanting of wildlings was found preferable to nursery stock because they are abundant and have better root systems (21). In some instances, however, dieback of the leader was observed. Pruned wildlings and shelterwood plantings of wildlings were then tested, but neither gave better results. Survival remained good, but growth was not improved. The lesson learned from testing of roble wildlings was that survival is high, even on waterlogged soils and exposed ridges. Leaves are lost after transplanting and the wildlings require about 6 to 8 months to recover, if rainfall is adequate. Of the size classes tested ranging through 60 cm (24 in), the best results were attained with the largest wildlings. Subsequent growth in all instances was slow and averaged about 1.8 m (6 ft) in 2 years. Vegetative Reproduction- Cuttings were tested on degraded heavy soils in Luquillo Forest and Carite, but only a few survived (19,20). Roble fence posts have been observed to sprout (26), but vegetative reproduction cannot be relied on for reforestation.",Reproduction and Early Growth,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Roble regenerates well in open fields and develops into a dense stand of seedlings, after which it appears to stagnate. This phenomenon may be partially attributable to the shallow, infertile soils and to exposure. The density of the seedling stands may also be a contributing factor. Plantations established in Puerto Rico show that the dominant and codominant stems averaged about 1 in (3.3 ft) in height growth and I cm (0.4 in) in diameter growth annually over a period of 11 to 14 years (table 2). Annual basal area growth was about 1.5 m² /ha (6.5 ft² /acre). Height growth in Hawaii was less, but the measurements were for smaller trees over a shorter period of time. Within natural forest, diameter increment varies between 0.28 to 0.39 cm (0.11 to 0.15 in) annually for all sites with the exception of limestone ridges where growth was only 0.13 cm (0.05 in) (table 2). In a study of several crop trees within the Sabana compartment of the Luquillo Forest, roble was found to grow significantly slower than the remaining species (10). Differences by crown class were evident. On more than 435 trees within the Sabana 8 compartment, annual diameter growth for dominants was 0.38 cm (0.15 in), codominants 0.32 cm (0.13 in), intermediates 0.21 cm (0.08 in), and suppressed stems 0.09 em (0.03 in). Moreover, diameter growth increased with increasing diameter class, perhaps due to a more favorable competitive position within the canopy (10). From a sample of 360 trees ranging in diameter from 9 to 40 cm (3.5 to 15.7 in) growing within a secondary, thinned stand, it was estimated that roble would attain the 40 cm (16 in) diameter class in about 100 years. Rooting Habit- The use of wildlings as planting stock revealed that young roble develops a thick stem and well-developed root system at an early age (21). Reaction to Competition- The silviculture of roble was also investigated by the staff of the Institute during the mid-1940's. Roble wildlings underplanted in an Australian beefwood (Casuarina equisetifolia) stand, a species used to provide a light shade, showed 80 percent survival after 18 months, but growth was very slow. In another experiment with nursery seedlings raised in sun vs. shade conditions, 40 percent greater height growth was ob served in the exposed conditions after 5 months. Shaded seedlings grew very little. In natural conditions, wildlings are capable of surviving shade for years with no appreciable growth (21). Roble regenerates and forms pure stands on grasslands and degraded soils, in particular on exposed upper slopes and ridges, where competition from faster growing, larger, and more tolerant trees is lacking (19). Plantations of roble wildlings usually require weedings where grass is dense, one at 6 months and a second at about 18 months. Plantations should have close spacing, not greater than 1.8 by 1.8 m (6 by 6 ft), so that ground cover is provided rapidly (21). Within the Lower Montane Rain Forest (1,2,3) of the Luquillo Mountains, roble was found on four of six permanent plots totaling 2.1 ha (5.2 acres), measured since the mid-1940's. Of the 30 species studied, it ranked 25th in density, 14th in basal area dominance, and 15th in volume (4). Moreover, on a scale of 1 (most tolerant) to 29 (most pioneer), roble ranked 20th in shade tolerance among tree species in the Luquillo Forest (23). The scale considered the presence of seed, seedlings, and understory trees within the forest. Overall, roble blanco is classed as intolerant of shade. Roble's persistence in the natural forest, despite its slow growth, is largely attributable to its capacity to survive on poor sites where competition is minimized. Damaging Agents- In the natural forest, pathogens do not appear to be of any consequence. However, branches of city and roadside trees are often deformed into a witches' broom appearance, apparently by a virus possibly transmitted by the leaf hopper Protalebra tabebuiae (8). The insect also defoliates the tree or causes the leaves to turn yellow and fall prematurely (16,22). A similar disease on a closely related species, Tabebuia pentaphylla, was observed on trees grown for cacao shade on the Paria peninsula of Venezuela (7). Because of the numerous problems with pathogens, some authorities have recommended that closely related members of the same genus be used as substitutes in ornamental plantings. A dieback disease was observed in 3 percent of potted trees in the Cambalache nursery on the north coast of Puerto Rico and was attributed to Botryodiplodia spp. (13). Transplants from a nearby wooded area to a golf course near the town of Dorado were infested by a shoot borer, probably Pachymorphus subductellus (14). The heartwood is rated as moderately durable in contact with the ground, but susceptible to Cryptotermes brevis, the dry wood termite (6,29) and marine borers (16). Moreover, the wood rates only fair in weathering characteristics. Unpainted wood loses its smooth surface and develops considerable checking (17).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,14,0
"In Puerto Rico, roble is found on sand, limestone, and heavy clay soils, acid or alkaline in reaction, and residual, alluvial, or colluvial in origin. It appears to grow best, however, on deep clays. Roble is a cosmopolitan species and is found on all soils presently identified in Puerto Rico. The most common soil order on the island is Inceptisols. Physiographically, it is most common on slopes and ridges (19) but is also found on flats adjacent to river beds (9). In general, it is tolerant of degraded sites and abandoned farm lands where it tends to form nearly pure stands. In Puerto Rico, roble is planted on poor sites to provide cover and to improve the soil. It is recommended for planting on uniform and convex slopes and ridges, where trials have shown it to be a promising species for reforestation (20). It has also done well on humid, waterlogged sites.",Soils and Topography,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,15,0
"The heartwood is light brown or golden and not easily separated from the sapwood. The grain is straight to interlocked, and the specific gravity is about 0.55. The wood seasons rapidly with little warping and is fairly easy to work, rating fair for planing, excellent for boring, mortising, and sanding, and good for turning. Penetration and absorption of preservatives is low, even in the sapwood (6,16,17,18). The wood is tough and strong for its weight. Roble's appearance and technical properties resemble both oak and ash. The wood is widely used for flooring, furniture, cabinetwork, interior trim, tool handles, decorative veneers, boatbuilding, ox yokes, millwork, and sporting goods. Less valuable grades are suitable for boxes, crates, concrete forms and similar items, and occasionally for posts and poles (16,17,18). Roble's large flowers and narrow, columnar crown have made it a favorite ornamental in yards and along roadsides throughout Puerto Rico. Flowering in many instances has been observed a few years after planting (22). The tree comes in readily on abandoned farm soils and is particularly adapted to degraded sites. Foresters have planted it on abandoned farmlands where its growth has been slow, but satisfactory. Roble is also classed as a honey plant.",Special Uses,"Roble Blanco, White-Cedar",tabebuia,heterophylla,hardwood,16,0
"In its native range the species is dominant in some areas and is often found in pure stands. Associated trees may include kinogum eucalyptus (Eucalyptus resinifera), bloodwood eucalyptus (E. gummifera), forest redgum eucalyptus (E. tereticornis), longleaf casuarina (Casuarina glauca), and various species of Melaleuca (8). Throughout the 1930's, when most of the tree planting was done in Hawaii, robusta eucalyptus was used to overplant failed plantations. Consequently, because robusta eucalyptus could survive on a wide variety of sites, it is found in many mixed plantings. Some common associates with robusta eucalyptus are saligna eucalyptus (Eucalyptus saligna), tallowwood eucalyptus (E. microcorys), melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), horsetail casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia), and silk-oak (Grevilla robusta). Treefern (Cibotium spp.) is also quite common in the understory of planted stands. One report refers to a pure stand of robusta eucalyptus being heavily invaded by Javanese podocarpus (Podocarpus cupressina). On wetter- sites on the island of Hawaii, robusta eucalyptus stands often develop a dense, almost impenetrable, understory of strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum).",Associated Forest Cover,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,1,0
"Robusta eucalyptus is native along the Australian coast of New South Wales and southeast Queensland. It is found mainly in swamps and on the edges of coastal lagoons and rivers where it is subject to periodic flooding (5,9). The mean maximum temperature in the hottest month is 30° to 32° C (86° to 90° F); the mean minimum of the coldest month is about 3° to 5° C (37° to 41° F). Throughout the native range, from 5 to 10 light frosts occur each year (6). In Hawaii, robusta eucalyptus grows well from near sea level to 1100 m (3,600 ft) where annual rainfall ranges from 1000 mm (40 in) to 6350 mm (250 in) and temperatures rarely if ever reach freezing. Robusta eucalyptus in Florida grows mainly in the southern portion of the State where frosts may occur annually. Mean annual rainfall averages 1320 min (52 in) with 70 to 80 percent of rain falling during the May to October wet season. In Puerto Rico the species makes its best growth in mountain regions about 460 m (1,500 ft) where annual rainfall averages 2540 mm (100 in) (17). In southern California and along coastal northern California, plantings of robusta eucalyptus have been subject to several unseasonal cold spells (11,20,21) where temperatures reached -9° C (16° F). In every instance severe foliage damage was initially observed (more than 80 percent of the crown foliage killed), but the stems recovered within 3 months. Although robusta eucalyptus can recover from occasional severe frost damage, the limiting variable in its distribution seems to be low temperature. If the temperature drops below -9° C (16° F) annually, introduced robusta eucalyptus will seldom be successful. In Yunnan Province, China, -7° C (19° F) damaged robusta eucalyptus, but to a lesser extent than E. globulus (4).",Native Range,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,11,0

"In 1975, foresters in southern Florida established a genetic base population of 352 collections of Eucalyptus robusta from individual selected trees in Australia, advanced generation families from two previous generations of selection in Florida, as well as selections from Florida's naturalized stands. This base population was subsequently selected and rogued to form a seedling seed orchard that produces seeds of a bona fide land race of E. robusta for southern Florida. This seed orchard was also a source of genetic material for an effort to develop E. grandis and E. robusta hybrids adapted to Florida conditions (7,19).",Hybrids,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,9,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Robusta eucalyptus has perfect flowers that are insect pollinated. In Florida, California, and Hawaii, trees have been observed to flower by the end of the third growing season. The peak flowering season in Florida is from September to November (7), and the peak season in California is from January to March (11). In Hawaii and more tropical areas, new flowers may appear at almost any time of the year and individual trees occasionally bloom year-round. The trees flower with 5 to 10 flowered axillary umbels. The sepals and petals are fused into a caplike structure (operculum) that drops off the tip of the flower bud at anthesis. The eucalypts are, in general, protandrous (23). The showy part of the cream-colored flower is actually the numerous filamentous stamens that surround the stigma. The fruit is a vase-shaped dark green capsule 12 to 15 mm (0.5 to 0.6 in) long that contains many small seeds. The fruit ripens 5 to 7 months after flowering. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds of robusta eucalyptus are small and like all eucalyptus contain no endosperm. The viable seed is difficult to separate from the chaff (unfertilized or aborted ovules) in the ripe flower capsules. There are 200 to 400 viable seeds per gram (5,700 to 11,300/oz) of seed and chaff (12). Seed dispersal is largely by wind and may begin within 6 weeks after the seed capsule ripens. In Florida, most trees retain seeds in closed capsules for more than 1 year after ripening (7). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (12). Robusta eucalyptus in Florida has occasionally reproduced naturally around abandoned homesteads, probably following fire on the native range. The seed source was usually an old amenity planting of robusta eucalyptus and the seedlings outgrew the disturbed native vegetation. The species does not invade recently abandoned agricultural fields because of the more intense competition from weeds (7). Most robusta eucalyptus stands in Florida are being established through the planting of container-grown stock. Seedlings in Florida need several months to grow into frost-hardy saplings before facing their first frost. Early spring planting would be ideal, but soil moisture is deficient until summer rainfall begins. Thus mid-June through mid-August is the recommended planting period (7). Most robusta eucalyptus stands in Hawaii have been established as single species plantings and, after logging or other disturbance, regenerate as pure stands of coppice and seedlings. Robusta eucalyptus has recently been used in biomass plantations. These were all made with container-grown seedlings to assure the rapid early start needed to stay ahead of the wide variety of competing, aggressive vegetation (25). After planting, container-grown seedlings in Hawaii grow almost 30 cm (12 in) per month for the first few years. Vegetative Reproduction- The majority of new stems in logged stands of robusta eucalyptus are of coppice origin. These coppice shoots arise from dormant buds in the cambium of the stump. All parts of the stem surface under the bark contain dormant buds that sprout rapidly after crown injury. Robusta eucalyptus is one of the Eucalyptus species that produces lignotubers. A lignotuber consists of a mass of vegetative buds and contains substantial food reserves. It begins forming in the axils of the cotyledons and the first three pairs of the seedling leaves. Eventually these organs are overgrown by the main stem and remain as tuberous bulges just above the root crown. When robusta eucalyptus is logged, therefore, the source of the coppice is usually the dormant buds in the stem cambium surrounding the stump. But if the entire stem is killed through fire, or in young seedlings through grazing, new coppice shoots may arise from the lignotubers (23). In a Florida test, robusta eucalyptus coppicing proved to be less influenced by season of cutting than either E. grandis or a hybrid E. grandis x robusta, but was reduced during the hot, dry summer (26). No rooted cuttings of robusta eucalyptus have been used on a commercial scale, but cuttings taken from young seedlings and young coppice shoots have been successfully rooted (10).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- In 1960, a study in eight different Hawaiian plantations of robusta eucalyptus gave the following growth data for plantations at elevations ranging from 395 to 730 m (1,300 to 2,400 ft), and trees aged 23 to 38 years, with 358 to 642 trees per hectare (145 to 260/acre) larger than 28 cm (11 in) in d.b.h. (14,22): Basal area: 51 to 184 m²/ha (220 to 800 ft²/acre). Height of dominants: 28 to 55 m (93 to 179 ft). Mean annual growth per stand: 7 to 48 m³/ha (100 to 685 ft³/acre). Mean annual growth for all eight stands: 26 m³/ha (370 ft³/acre). One of Florida's first eucalyptus plantations of operational scale established with genetically improved seedlings was established in 1972 on a palmetto prairie site. Within this planting, a system of inventory plots was established to develop the data needed to determine optimum rotation length, expected yields, and other management guidelines. Although the planting is considered seriously understocked with 786 trees per hectare (318 trees/acre), measurements at 10.25 years estimate a mean annual yield of 16.7 m³/ha (238 ft³/acre). Mean height of all stems was 16.6 m (54.5 ft) and height of dominant class trees only was 21.3 m (70 ft). Stand volume in 1979 was 172 m³/ha (2,458 ft³/acre) (7,18). Planted trees in Puerto Rico have reached 27.4 m (90 ft) in height and 41 cm (16 in) in d.b.h. in 15 years (17). Coppice stands often outproduce seedling stands. A 10-year-old coppice stand in Hawaii produced 140 m³/ha (2,000 ft³/acre), while an adjacent 12-year-old seedling stand yielded only 96 m³ /ha (1,372 ft³/acre) (3). Rooting Habit- The most distinctive characteristic of the rooting habit of robusta eucalyptus in Hawaii is the tree's ability, in moist areas, to initiate adventitious roots from buds on the stem at heights of 6 to 12 m (20 to 40 ft) (fig. 2) (13). These roots grow downward through the moist bark and into the soil. As the root grows in diameter, it sometimes breaks free from the soft bark and appears as an aerial root. The lower stems of occasional robusta eucalyptus become completely encased in an interwoven mass of these aerial roots, some of them 20 cm (8 in) in diameter (14). The species rarely displays this habit in its native range or in more temperate climates. Adventitious roots, however, have been noted on a robusta eucalyptus in the Sydney Botanical Garden in Australia, and near Rio de Janeiro (15). Although some layering from the stem may occur as noted earlier, most roots originate below the lignotubers and occupy the entire available soil profile on well-drained sites. Robusta eucalyptus is usually quite windfirm on deeper soils and is often used for windbreaks in Hawaii. Reaction to Competition- Robusta eucalyptus is classed as intolerant of shade. Where planted in alternate rows with saligna eucalyptus it is invariably overtopped, suppressed, and usually dies within 30 years. In Hawaii, robusta eucalyptus is planted on prepared sites and usually grows faster than weedy competitors invading the site. On extremely refractory sites robusta eucalyptus is considered the species of last resort because of its remarkable ability to survive and grow. Damaging Agents-Robusta eucalyptus is remarkably free of serious insects or diseases when grown in the United States. Cylindrocladium scoparium has caused serious losses of seedlings in Florida (1). However, this fungus can now be successfully controlled by fumigation of soil and containers with methyl bromide before sowing and a followup treatment with benomyl spray. The major cause of damage to robusta eucalyptus stands in Hawaii is wind (14). Violent windstorms have snapped stems and uprooted trees. Uprooting damage can be particularly severe when stands are established in shallow soils overlaying a solid mantle of lava rock. Naturally, such shallow soils should be avoided and planting concentrated on soils or fractured bedrock where roots can penetrate to greater depths. In Florida, robusta eucalyptus plantings at about age 5 may develop a condition called ""robusta breakup."" Patches of young trees may develop a bend in the main stem or on primary branches. Breakage may also occur along the main stem or primary branches, and the wood at the point of breakage may appear dry and brash. No primary pathogens or pests have been associated with this breakage. Minor element deficiencies are suspected but are not proven as the cause. Adjacent stands of rosegum eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) appear unaffected (7).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,14,0
"Robusta eucalyptus grows well on a variety of soils, ranging from its native intermittently flooded sites (6,9) to the hot summer-dry soils of California's Central Valley (11). In Florida, typical soils are poorly drained, acid, fine sands with hardpans at depths proportional to the depth of the seasonally high water table. Robusta eucalyptus does best on the least poorly drained of these soils, which are typical of arenic and aeric haplaquods of the order Spodosols (7). Most robusta eucalyptus in Hawaii are planted on sites considered too steep for agriculture-usually slopes of 10 to 20 percent. On the older islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and Maui, trees were planted predominantly on Oxisols and Ultisols. On the youngest island, Hawaii, plantings are mainly on Histosols and Inceptisols. All these soils are formed on basaltic parent materials, either volcanic ash or lava rocks. Soils are low in nitrogen and phosphorus and often strongly acidic. The lava substrate may be in either almost continuous sheets or in highly fractured porous clinkers. Soil drainage, therefore, varies from very poor to extremely rapid in very short distances.",Soils and Topography,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,15,0
"Robusta eucalyptus has found use in urban forestry and as farm windbreaks because of its dark shiny leaves and its generally dense crown. Twigs and branches continually die off and fall to the ground, however, so that the tree is rather hazardous for use in parklands, campgrounds, or even gardens. On the island of Kauai, an older roadside planting of robusta eucalyptus, though most attractive, is maintained at a high cost for road cleanup.",Special Uses,Robusta Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,robusta,hardwood,16,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Rock elm flowers appear 2 weeks before the leaves at any time from March to May, depending on locality and site. The perfect flowers are protandrous, that is, the male elements of the flower develop 2 to 4 days before the female elements are receptive (6). Female flowers are receptive for only a few days. The hairy fruit has a broad wing from 13 to 25 mm (0.5 to 1 in) long and matures during May or June. Clean, fully ripened, unwinged seeds number from 11,000 to 19,800/kg (5,000 to 9,000/lb). Seeds germinate soon after they ripen. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees 20 years old produce viable seeds, but maximum yields are from trees 45 to 125 years old. Good crops occur every 3 or 4 years. Ripe seeds are dispersed as the leaves become fully expanded, which is usually 2 or 3 weeks later than the time of seed drop for American elm (9). Although the thin, hair-fringed, winged samaras seem adapted to wind dispersal, seeds are generally carried no more than 40 to 45 m (100 to 150 ft) from the parent tree. The fact that rock elm grows as scattered individuals, often several miles from the nearest seed source, suggests that birds and small mammals play a role in dissemination. The large but very light seeds are also buoyant and water can carry them long distances. As a result, seeds often are concentrated along the banks of streams and lakes. Seedling Development- Rock elm seeds germinate within a week or two after dispersal if moisture conditions are favorable. In a germination test, 90 to 100 percent of mature seeds were viable (2). Viability was not significantly different between seeds from different trees, between seeds with wings or without wings, or between seeds with seed coats or without seed coats. When germinated in a petri dish, radicles of the viable seeds emerged within 2 or 3 days and were 2.5 to 3.8 cm (1 to 1.5 in) long by the end of the fifth day Germination is epigeal. The cotyledons began to open about the fifth or sixth day. Under favorable conditions, rock elm seedlings are from 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) tall by the end of the first summer. Despite its high seed viability, rock elm regenerates poorly (2,9). Germination tests failed when mineral soil and equal volumes of peat moss, sand, and mineral soil were used for planting media, but 70 to 80 percent emergence was obtained in flats using peat moss. Another factor affecting seedling establishment is the persistence of dormant terminal buds. Emergent seedlings rarely develop more than a single pair of true leaves during the first growing season due to this dormancy. Observations on more than 200 seedlings indicated that only 1 percent broke dormancy long enough to develop an additional internode and a second pair of true leaves. This species appears to be shade tolerant during the seedling stage (10). However, under field conditions with competition, 1.5-0 nursery stock averaged only 27 cm (10.6 in) in height 5 years after planting and only 52 cm (20.4 in) 10 years after planting in northern Wisconsin. In the same study, survival ranged from 85 percent at the end of the 1st year to 32 percent at the end of the 10th year. Vegetative Reproduction- Rock elm regenerates vegetatively from root suckers and stump sprouts (10), but vegetative reproduction in the field is uncommon. Most elms are considered difficult to root by means of cuttings. However, leaf-bud cuttings, consisting of leaf blade, axillary bud, and a shield of stem tissue, treated with a growth hormone and held under constant mist on a rooting medium of sand or mica, produced satisfactory results for several species of elm including rock elm (5).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Rock Elm,ulmus,thomasii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Few species have rock elm's capacity for recovering from prolonged suppression. An analysis of 153 trees indicated that a large percentage had survived under suppression for 50 years or more. This capacity makes it difficult to correlate diameter and age (9): The average number of rings per 2.5 cm (1 in) of radius by crown class was about 50 for suppressed, 30 to 40 for intermediate, 20 to 30 for codominants, and 10 to 20 for dominants. On average to better sites, mature rock elm may reach 27 in (90 ft) in total height and 61 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. (12). In virgin hardwood stands in the east and north, 27 to 30 in (90 to 100 ft) heights and 91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 in) in d.b.h. have been recorded (10). Much smaller trees occur along river bluffs, on limestone outcrops, or other sites with thin soil mantles. Rock elm may live 250 to 300 years. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Rock elm is considered shade tolerant in the seedling-sapling stage and often recovers successfully after long periods of suppression at these stages. As the tree grows older, however, it apparently becomes more light demanding. Overall, the species is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade (10). Damaging Agents- Nearly all native North American elm species are susceptible to Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) (6,13) and isolates of C. ulmi have been obtained from rock elm logs (5). It is likely that Dutch elm disease will greatly reduce the number of rock elm.. A seed-borne fungus (Gleosporium ulmicolum) has been reported for rock elm but few of the fungi that are able to invade the fruits and seeds of North American hardwoods are thought to be pathogens that reduce germination or weaken seedlings (1). Although rock elm has not been listed as a particular host for specific insects, undoubtedly it is host to the various borers, defoliators, and sucking insects that attack American elm. Throughout the range of rock elm, killing frosts are common during the flowering period and subfreezing temperatures may prevent seed development in some years.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Rock Elm,ulmus,thomasii,hardwood,14,0
"Rock elm is most frequent in lower Michigan, Wisconsin, and southern Ontario, and it is regularly found on moist but well-drained sandy loam, loam, or silt loam soils in mixture with other hardwoods. In Wisconsin, rock elm is most frequent in the southern wet-mesic forest (7). Although rock elm often grows on rocky ridges, limestone outcroppings, and streambanks, the highest quality sawtimber is found on deeper loamy soils. The major soil orders associated with the distribution of rock elm are the Mollisols, Alfisols, and the Spodosols. Most common are the Hapludalfs (Gray-Brown Podzolic soils) within the Udalfs suborder of the Alfisols. Soil pH ranges from slightly alkaline or neutral to strongly acid.",Soils and Topography,Rock Elm,ulmus,thomasii,hardwood,15,0
"The seeds and buds of rock elm are eaten by deer, rabbits, squirrels, and a variety of birds. Small mammals such as chipmunks, ground squirrels, and mice apparently relish the filbertlike flavor of rock elm seed and frequently eat the major part of the crop. Rock elm wood has long been valued for its exceptional strength and superior quality (3,8). For this reason rock elm has been drastically overcut in many localities. The wood is stronger, harder, and stiffer than any of the other commercial species of elms. It is highly shock resistant and has excellent bending qualities which make it good for bent parts of furniture, crates and containers, and a base for veneer. Much of the old-growth was exported for ship timbers. Currently, the highest quality sawtimber is found in north-central Wisconsin, lower Michigan, and southeastern Ontario.",Special Uses,Rock Elm,ulmus,thomasii,hardwood,16,0
"Rocky Mountain juniper is most common as a component of the foothills or woodland coniferous zone; in some areas it extends into the montane zone in significant amounts. It forms a distinct forest cover type, Rocky Mountain Juniper (Society of American Foresters Type 220), from northern Colorado and Utah northward. Southward it becomes associated with Pinyon-Juniper (Type 239) (27,36). Rocky Mountain juniper, because of its scattered distribution over a broad range, is often found in complex transition zones or growing on exposed or severe sites within other forest types (27,36). In these situations, however, it is rarely more than a minor component of the forest association. Rocky Mountain juniper is found in the following forest cover types, among others: 206 Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir 208 Whitebark Pine 209 Bristlecone Pine 210 Interior Douglas-Fir 212 Western Larch 216 Blue Spruce 217 Aspen 218 Lodgepole Pine 219 Limber Pine 221 Red Alder 233 Oregon White Oak 235 Cottonwood-Willow 236 Bur Oak 237 Interior Ponderosa Pine 240 Arizona Cypress 241 Western Live Oak Differences in elevation, latitude, physiography, and soils, which affect temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and nutrient conditions, in combination with phytozoological interactions, influence the composition of forests in which Rocky Mountain juniper grows. Furthermore, fire has influenced the development of regional differences for Rocky Mountain juniper distribution, associated complexes, and related biotic associations. Only in the northern parts of its range, at middle and lower elevations, does it form pure stands (14,21,48). Throughout its range south to northern New Mexico and Arizona, Rocky Mountain juniper intermingles with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) on southern and western exposures and with interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) on northern and eastern exposures where it is more abundant. At higher elevations, Rocky Mountain juniper is occasionally associated with Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and limber pine (P. flexilis) throughout the Rocky Mountains. In its central and southern range, Rocky Mountain juniper has been reported with white fir (Abies concolor), blue spruce (Picea pungens), aspen (Populus tremuloides), and narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia); at higher elevations it is occasionally or rarely found with bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) (36,42). At higher elevations, in British Columbia, Alberta, Idaho, and western Montana, Rocky Mountain juniper is occasionally found with subalpine larch (Larix lyalli) western white pine (Pinus monticola), limber pine, or whitebark pine (P. albicaulis). It is associated with whitebark pine at higher elevations in western Wyoming. In the Pacific Northwest, Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) and red alder (Alnus rubra) are commonly associated with Rocky Mountain juniper, along with Douglas-fir at slightly higher elevations on Vancouver Island, the San Juan Islands, and the inland area around Puget Sound (20,36,42). Rocky Mountain juniper grades into variations of the pinyon-juniper complexes at middle to lower elevations, southward from Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. Within these complexes, Rocky Mountain juniper generally decreases in density in relation to pinyon species with an increase in elevation. The usual junipers are Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), one-seed juniper (J. monosperma), and alligator juniper (J. deppeana). The pinyons may be pinyon (Pinus edulis), Mexican pinyon (P. cembroides), or singleleaf pinyon (P. monophylla). This association is well developed on the Coconino Plateau in Arizona, where it is referred to as the pygmy conifer biome (14,26,29). Rocky Mountain juniper is often associated with open-grown scrubby ponderosa pine or bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) growing on severe sites in the rough, broken tableland topography of western North and South Dakota and eastern Montana and Wyoming (27). Occasionally in this area, it forms small but almost pure stands. Along stream bottoms and in protected draws, it is occasionally found with a variable but generally incomplete mixture of deciduous trees that may include cottonwood (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), American elm (Ulmus americana), boxelder (Acer negundo), bur oak, and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis). In the Black Hills, it may, rarely, be found with white spruce (Picea glauca). Because of Rocky Mountain juniper's association with a wide range of forest-shrub-grassland types, a complete list of understory vegetation would be too long to include here. Sparse understories are a characteristic of Rocky Mountain juniper stands, however, particularly on dry sites and where the species is dominant or codominant. Some of the shrubs reported as understory components are American plum (Prunus americana), antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), cliffbush (Jamesia americana), cliffrose (Cowania mexicana), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), fernbush (Chamaebatiaria millefolium), mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus spp.), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), currant (Ribes spp.), rose (Rosa spp.), sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), winterfat (Eurotia lanata), and shadscale saltbush (Atriplex confertifolia). Also, it shares sites with common juniper (Juniperus communis) throughout its range and with creeping juniper (J. horizontalis) in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana, and Alberta (20). Common grass and grasslike associates of Rocky Mountain juniper at lower elevations in its northern range include wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.), fescue (Festuca spp.), needlegrass (Stipa spp.), grama (Bouteloua spp.), and bluegrass (Poa spp.). In the southern Rocky Mountains, it is found with grama, galleta (Hilaria spp.), and tobosa (Hilaria mutica). Along its eastern distribution from North Dakota to Texas, Rocky Mountain juniper grows with wheatgrass, grama, buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides), bluestem (Andropogon spp.), and sandreed (Calamovilfa spp.) (20,26).",Associated Forest Cover,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,1,1
"The climate generally associated with Rocky Mountain juniper is dry and subhumid. The range of climatic conditions is broad, however, extending from maritime to subalpine to semiarid. Temperature extremes range from 43° to -37° C (110° to -35° F), but conditions are more favorable to the species when minimum temperatures exceed -23° to -21° C (-10° to -5° F). Average July temperatures in different areas vary from about 16° to 24° C (60° to 75° F), and average January temperatures from about -9° to 4° C (15° to 40° F). Average number of frost-free days varies from 120 days in parts of the northern Rocky Mountains to 175 days at lower elevations in Arizona and New Mexico. The longest growing season is near sea level in the Puget Sound area (36,39,42). Average annual precipitation varies in amount, distribution, and type. Over much of the Rocky Mountain juniper range, precipitation averages 380 to 460 mm (15 to 18 in), with variation from 305 mm (12 in) in areas of the Southwest, Great Basin, and eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado to 660 mm (26 in) on Vancouver Island. More than half of the precipitation occurs in late fall or early winter on the Pacific coast and west of the Continental Divide in the northern Rocky Mountains. In the northern Great Plains and east of the divide in the northern and central Rocky Mountains, the period of heaviest precipitation is spring and early summer, but this period is late summer and early fall in the Great Basin, Southwest, and southern Rocky Mountains. In general, snow accounts for about one-third to one-half of the total annual moisture, but the amount is highly variable depending upon location (44) (table 1). Recent paleobotanical studies indicate the macroclimate covering much of the Rocky Mountain juniper range has changed from mesic to more xeric conditions. Rocky Mountain juniper is a drought-enduring species and it is more hardy than eastern redcedar; however it is generally less drought-resistant than other western tree juniper species, and the climatic change has not been favorable for regeneration or growth. Ten-thousand years ago, during the Holocene, the species was present in the Wisconsin forests. As recently as 1,000 years ago, extensive stands of Rocky Mountain juniper were present in Western Nebraska and in the Laramie Basin of Wyoming, with specimens often reaching 131 cm (52 in) d.b.h. (38,42,45,47).",Climate,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,2,1
"Hybridization and the development of races of Rocky Mountain juniper are complex. The whole population within the Missouri River Basin is reported to be a hybrid swarm of Rocky Mountain juniper and eastern redcedar, with neither of the extreme parental types being found; also, the trees tend increasingly toward Rocky Mountain juniper in a line from the southeast to the northwest. It has been shown that controlled hybridization between these two species is possible. A tri-parental hybrid swarm that includes horizontal juniper and eastern redcedar (J. uirginiana) has also been reported in western portions of the northern Great Plains. In the Southwest, hybridization with alligator juniper has been reported (7,8,14,46). No subspecies have been identified for Rocky Mountain juniper. Two naturally occurring varieties have been reported. J. scopulorum var. columnaris, a columnar form, is found only in North Dakota. A depressed shrub, J. s. var. patens, found in Wyoming and Alberta, is considered to be a hybrid with horizontal juniper (32,42). Several horticultural and ornamental varieties have been reported. Most of these have been developed from the natural columnar variety in North Dakota and from the ornamental variety J. scopulorum var. viridifolia, called ""Chandler Blue"" and ""Hill Silver"" (16). Other varieties include ""Medora,"" a bluish, semicolumnar compact form; ""Moffet,"" similar to Medora but somewhat less compact; ""Welch,"" a blue-green pyramidal type with upright branches; ""Pathfinder,"" a silver-blue type of more open form; ""Colorgreen,"" a reasonably compact green variety; and ""Hillborn Globe,"" a broad, blue-green pyramid form. Most of these varieties have been introduced into the horticultural trade as grafted specimens.",Hybrids,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,9,1
"Of 11 junipers native to the United States normally reaching tree size, Rocky Mountain juniper is the most widely distributed in western North America (22,49). Within its range the distribution is considerably scattered; however, the concentrations, from central British Columbia and southern Alberta through northwestern Montana and southeastern Idaho into Colorado and northern New Mexico, generally follow the Rocky Mountains. In addition, there are fairly extensive concentrations in western portions of the northern Great Plains, in the Uinta and Wasatch Mountains of Utah, and in a band approximately 100 km (62 mi) wide beginning near the Grand Canyon in northwest Arizona and following the Arizona Plateau southeast into the Black Mountains of southwestern New Mexico. - The native range of Rocky Mountian juniper.",Native Range,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,11,1
"Information on population variability of Rocky Mountain juniper is incomplete. Undoubtedly, any species with its scattered distribution and wide elevational and latitudinal range will show differences between subsets of the total population in such features as growth, morphology, phenology, and resistance to heat and cold. Recent studies on variations of terpenoids, other volatile oils, and isozymes are providing more information about differences not only among individuals but among segments of the population (31). A study on the overlapping populations of Rocky Mountain juniper and eastern redcedar in the Missouri River Basin indicates that secondary intergradation (allopatric introgression) is occurring rather than primary intergradation (allopatric divergence), and the gene flow is primarily in an easterly direction (9).",Population Differences,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Rocky Mountain juniper is dioecious. Both pistillate and staminate flowers are small and are borne on the ends of short branchlets or along the branchlet from mid-April to mid-June. The greenish-yellow female flowers usually contain one or two ovules and become more conspicuous during late summer, opening the following spring before pollination. Pollen is disseminated primarily by wind from inconspicuous yellow male flowers on short branchlets, each flower usually containing six stamens. Female flowers are composed of three to eight pointed scales which become fleshy and fuse to form small indehiscent strobili, commonly called ""berries"" (15,18). The berries ripen the second year after pollination from mid-September to mid-December and remain on the tree until March or April of the following spring; however, some fruits may persist on the tree for as long as 3 years (18). Immature berries are green and glaucous; ripe berries are bluish purple and covered with a conspicuous white, waxy bloom. The rounded fruit is resinous with a thin coat and averages about 5 to 8 min (0.2 to 0.3 in) in diameter. Seed Production and Dissemination- Rocky Mountain juniper may begin bearing seed at 10 years of age, under favorable conditions. The optimum age for seed production is 50 to 200 years. Trees that are open grown, stunted, or under stress often are prolific seed producers. Rocky Mountain juniper is rated as a good to prolific seed producer throughout most of its range, but in parts of Idaho and Montana, production is reported as only fair. The interval between heavy seed crops varies from 2 to 5 years, but some seed is produced almost every year. Rocky Mountain juniper is as good a seed producer as its other tree associates, with the possible exception of Utah juniper and singleleaf pinyon. It is a better producer than common or creeping juniper (18,42). Each Rocky Mountain juniper fruit usually contains one, sometimes two, and rarely three brownish seeds, and 100 kg (220 lb) of berries yields 11 to 28 kg (24 to 62 lb) of seeds. The angular, lightly grooved seeds are about 5 mm (0.2 in) in length and 3 mm (0.1 in) in thickness; they average about 59 700/kg (27,100/lb) but range from 39 200 to 92 800/kg (17,800 to 42,100/lb) (18). Rocky Mountain juniper is considered to have a high proportion of unfilled seeds, but the number varies widely from tree to tree and from season to season. Interacting factors causing filled or unfilled seeds are only partially understood; some of the most important are stand age, structure, density, and species composition; physiography; and favorable or unfavorable weather conditions for flower development, pollination, and seed development (8,18). Viability of Rocky Mountain juniper seed is only fair and, except for alligator juniper, is not as good as other juniper or pinyon species with which it grows. Recent studies indicate that average germinative capacity is 22 percent, with maximums rarely exceeding 35 percent; however, in one study germination averaged 45 percent and varied from 32 to 58 percent. In another study, seed stored in less than ideal conditions had 30 percent germination after 3.5 years. Under proper storage conditions, at least some of the seed may remain viable for several years (14,18). Rocky Mountain juniper seeds are disseminated primarily by birds, secondarily by gravity and water. A few mammals play a minor role. The berries are eaten mostly during fall and winter months, when other foods are relatively scarce. Bohemian waxwings are known to eat large numbers of berries. Cedar waxwings, robins, turkeys, and the jays- Mexican, pinyon, scrub, Stellar's, and blue-have all been known to feed on the berries at times. As domestic sheep feed on juniper berries, propagation is noticeable along trails between grazing ranges (30). Bighorn sheep and deer occasionally eat the berries, but they normally browse juniper only under stress conditions. Dissemination of seeds by small mammals is thought to be insignificant (30,33,42). Thus, natural distribution patterns are affected by bird and animal populations, their daily and migratory movements, location and prevalence of berries, and availability and desirability of other foods. These variables, combined with specific site and weather conditions for germination and establishment, are largely responsible for the scattered distribution of Rocky Mountain juniper within its total range. Artificial regeneration of Rocky Mountain juniper is commercially significant, and large amounts of seed are required to produce the nursery stock needed for planting in shelterbelts, parks, and landscapes, and on mine spoils or other disturbed sites. Fruits should be collected early enough in the fall to avoid losses to birds and animals, but immature fruits should not be gathered because they are difficult to separate from mature fruits (18). Seeds may be stored either in the dried fruits or as cleaned seeds. A moisture content of 10 to 12 percent is considered satisfactory for long-term storage, and the clean seeds or dried fruits should be stored in sealed containers at -7° to 4° C (20° to 40° F). Normally, Rocky Mountain juniper seeds germinate the second spring after a 14- to 16-month ""after-ripening"" period that breaks embryo dormancy. Low germination percentages and slow germination, with germination sometimes being delayed more than 2 years, are not unusual, however. These problems result from a combination of chemical factors in the embryo and physical factors, such as the thick, hard, outer layer of the two-layered seedcoat, which has only a very small permeable area in the hilum (1, 6). Specific effects of passage through the digestive tract of a bird or animal on germination of Rocky Mountain juniper are not known; however, it could improve germination, as digestion acts as a scarification and acid treatment. A report on the pinyon-juniper type states that germination of juniper (species not indicated) was materially improved by such passage (30). Germination is epigeal (18). Seedling Development- Under natural conditions, Rocky Mountain juniper seedlings become established more readily on moist sites under partial shade; in fact, the characteristic sparseness of Rocky Mountain juniper regeneration is due partly to its inability to establish itself on drier sites. The moist sites favored by Rocky Mountain juniper often are conducive to frost-heaving, however, which can take a heavy toll of seedlings. In nurseries, seedlings are best established on mulched seedbeds under partial shade (2,18,42). The seedlings, characterized by acicular foliage (sharp-pointed leaves), develop slowly under natural conditions. They are reported to reach a height of 30 cm (12 in) in 8 years in northern New Mexico and Arizona. Their growth is more rapid in nurseries, where they often reach 15 cm (6 in) or more in 3 years. The preferred age for nursery stock for field plantings depends on the area and includes 2-0, 3-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, or 2-2 stock. Potting or balling Rocky Mountain juniper for field planting increases survival over bare root planting during dry years but adds considerably to the cost. During the fall, seedlings often change from the normal green to a bluish purple because of freezing weather, less precipitation, or changes in light intensity (18,42). Seedlings in the juvenile stages are sometimes confused with common juniper seedlings, but they do not have the basally jointed leaves of that species (15). Vegetative Reproduction- Rocky Mountain juniper does not reproduce naturally by sprouts or layering. Cuttings can be grown satisfactorily in a rooting medium if they are given a basal treatment of indolebutyric acid in talc and misted intermittently for 3 s/min (12,42).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,13,1
"In the sapling stage, Rocky Mountain juniper has mature foliage characterized by small, somewhat obtuse, scalelike leaves. The sapling bark is usually reddish brown and slightly rough and scaly, but not stringy and fibrous as when mature (14,15). Mature Rocky Mountain juniper can vary from shrub size to small trees, with wide variation in crowns. Typically, it has a central trunk and a conical crown, slightly more rounded than eastern redcedar with which it is often confused (37). Branches are spreading, normally extending to ground level; small branches often droop slightly. Mature trees, as well as saplings, vary in color from light green or a yellowish green to dark green. The presence of mature fruits can give the tree a bluish-green or gray appearance. Growth and Yield- Rocky Mountain juniper grows slowly and rather uniformly throughout its range; however, rates of growth have not been thoroughly studied. In the Southwest, average height at 40 years of age has been reported to be about 4 m (13 ft), indicating a growth rate of 10.3 cm (4.1 in) per year. At age 40, height growth declines to about 3.4 cm per year (1.3 in) until age 80, at which time trees average about 5 m (18 ft) tall. Thereafter, height growth is fairly uniform at 1.8 cm per year (0.7 in), producing trees 9 m (30 ft) tall at about 300 years of age. Diameter growth measured at 30 cm (12 in) above the ground (basal diameter) was also reported as slow, with a growth rate of 0.2 cm (0.08 in) per year. This growth rate is fairly uniform until the trees are about 170 years old or average about 33 cm (13 in) in basal diameter. The rate then declines over a period of about 40 years to another constant rate of about 0.08 cm (0.03 in) per year when the tree is 210 years old. This growth rate may be sustained until the tree is 300 or more years old. Basal diameters of trees 300 years old averaged 43 cm (17 in). The species is long lived, with ages of 300 years not uncommon. A relic specimen in western South Dakota was estimated to have been 750 years old when it died; one unusual specimen in Logan Canyon, UT, is reported to be 3,000 years old (4,42). Tree growth varies considerably with location and site condition. In Canada, the trees usually grow to 30 cm (12 in) in basal diameter and 3 to 4 m (10 to 12 ft) tall, although a few trees reach 9 m (30 ft) in height. Trees on the north rim of the Grand Canyon are 5 to 6 m (15 to 20 ft) tall and 30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) in basal diameter. Heights of 6 to 15 m (20 to 50 ft) and basal diameters up to 46 cm (18 in) are reported from other areas of the Southwest (14,42). Rocky Mountain juniper is not recognized as a commercial timber species, so limited volume and growth prediction data are available. Stand yield prediction equations have been developed for the species in Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. Most information available is generalized and related to harvesting for fenceposts and firewood and to management of stands for watershed, range, wildlife, and shelterbelts. It is a fragile forest type and overcutting or improper management for livestock use reduces wildlife habitat and damages watershed (5,30). The future management of Rocky Mountain juniper as a forest type, of which only about 22 percent is in national forests, is unclear; furthermore, present conditions for management are not well known. As an associate of the pinyon-juniper type, the species is recommended for 200-year-rotation management and both even- and uneven-aged silvicultural systems can be applied. In the past, harvesting varied from light-cutting and high-grading to excessive overcutting; in recent years pinyon-juniper has been removed from large areas by chaining to increase forage for livestock. Except in limited areas in rather inaccessible places, few so-called virgin stands remain (1,10,30). Rooting Habit- Rocky Mountain juniper is considered to have a shallow but fairly extensive lateral root system, particularly where trees are growing over cemented subsoils or in rocky areas that limit depth of root penetration. The species develops a deeper root system along bottom lands with deeper soils. In the nursery, undercutting of third-year seedlings stimulates strong lateral root development (18). Reaction to Competition- Rocky Mountain juniper normally is a component of long-term seral or near-climax vegetation. It is relatively shade-tolerant during the seedling and sapling stages, but it later becomes more intolerant and is unable to endure as much shade as eastern redcedar-its eastern counterpart. Rocky Mountain juniper requires top light for height growth and crown development, and trunk branches die out when it develops in overly dense, pure stands or under deep shade of other tree species. In the northern Rocky Mountains, it is considered less tolerant of shade than ponderosa pine, limber pine, or lodgepole pine but is reported to endure considerable shade from broadleaf trees in protected canyons and sheltered sites on the Pacific coast (26,42). Overall, it is most accurately classed as a very shade-intolerant species. In Utah, junipers have been observed to invade sagebrush stands under certain conditions; pinyon generally follows and has a tendency to replace the juniper. Pinyon-juniper may encroach into grasslands that have been overused or disturbed in some manner, as juniper germination and establishment are favored by mineral soil. Rocky Mountain juniper also has allelopathic properties that can inhibit establishment of competing grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Herbicides can be used to kill individual trees, to keep chained areas from revegetating, and to restore recently invaded grasslands. However, Rocky Mountain juniper and one-seed juniper are the most difficult of the juniper species to kill (17,24,26,28,42). Controlled burning to reduce competition from juniper species has had varied results. Insufficient ground-fuel and wide topographical and meteorological variables make it difficult to use fire throughout the entire range of Rocky Mountain juniper. Generally, fire has been more successful in the southern areas of the species' range (48). Once established, Rocky Mountain juniper competes well with understory vegetation for water and minerals. In a shelterbelt study, its height growth exceeded Siberian pea shrub, green ash, boxelder, or American elm when competing with undisturbed sod-forming grasses. Removal of the sod did increase juniper growth, but not significantly (34). Apparently no silvicultural guidelines or cutting methods have been developed for Rocky Mountain juniper. Its shade tolerance when young would tend to rule out the clearcut method. Development of shade intolerance with maturity might suggest a three- or four-step shelterwood system, should a need develop to grow and harvest Rocky Mountain juniper in pure stands. Damaging Agents- Rocky Mountain juniper is susceptible to loss from erosion simply because it often becomes established on exposed sites where soils are readily eroded. Overuse of ranges by livestock, bison (in North and South Dakota), and occasionally deer can accelerate the erosion process. Because animals use the trees as ""rubbing posts,"" they cause considerable physical damage to stems and roots, including wounds that may admit pathogens. In addition, they browse the foliage when range conditions are poor and animal concentrations are high. This browsing, called ""high-lining,"" reduces crown size, ultimately affecting growth and vigor. Rocky Mountain juniper is attacked by a complex of arachnids, insects, and nematodes (11,37). Two species of spider mites (Oligonychus ununguis and Eurytetranychus admes) feed on foliage and occasionally develop epidemic populations. Two species of juniper berry mites (Trisetacus quadrisetus and T. neoquadrisetus) that destroy the fruits have been reported in British Columbia and Oregon (35). A small red false spider mite (Pentamerismus erythreus), sometimes called red spider, is not rated as a forest pest but can be a serious problem in shelterbelts and landscape plantings. Rocky Mountain juniper is host to several species of Coleoptera (true insects), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Diptera (flies and midges), and Psyllids (jumping plant lice) that damage the roots, bole, twigs, foliage, and berries. A nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, has injured Rocky Mountain juniper seedlings by causing root lesions. The damage has been reported only in the nursery, where populations of the nematode have reached high levels (13). A broad range of diseases associated with Rocky Mountain juniper attack the roots, stems, and foliage; but the most serious disease probably is a blight caused by Cercospora sequoiae. Some shelterbelts in the Great Plains have lost most of their junipers from this disease. Rocky Mountain juniper is also an alternate host for a cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) which can be a serious problem in the apple industry. The most conspicuous stem diseases are rusts caused by Gymnosporangium spp. and by mistletoes (Phoradendron spp.). These infestations generally are noted by the formation of twig excrescences, woody galls, and witches' brooms (13,19). Seedling diseases of Rocky Mountain juniper have not been thoroughly studied. It is normally resistant to damping-off fungi; however, Rhizoctonia solani has caused losses in Texas (12). Phomopsis blight (Phomopsis juniperovora) can destroy seedlings in the nursery and reduce survival of outplanted seedlings from partial blighting of the foliage. This blight is seldom found on trees older than 4 years; the disease does not thrive under the dry conditions prevailing on most juniper sites. In some nurseries, juniper cultivars have developed magnesium-deficiency symptoms that were similar to symptoms of Phomopsis blight. Ectotrophic mycorrhizae are rare on the Cupressaceae. Most Juniperus species examined have been primarily endomycorrhized. No fungi have been reported to form mycorrhizae with Rocky Mountain juniper. Tuber griseum and T. melanosporum have been reported with juniper species in general, however, and Elaphomyces granulatus had been reported for common juniper (13,40). Rocky Mountain juniper is susceptible to death or severe injury from fire, primarily because the fibrous, stringy bark is thin, and the lower branches contain significant amounts of volatile oils and normally extend to the ground (13).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,14,1
"Edaphic factors for Rocky Mountain juniper can be characterized as nonspecific and variable, as evidenced by the broad ecological range of the species and its adaptability to a wide variety of soils and conditions in shelterbelt reclamation and landscape plantings. Within pinyon-juniper woodlands in Arizona and New Mexico there are 5 soil orders, 10 great-groups, 40 subgroups, and 150 soil families (3,16,25,34). Rocky Mountain juniper is most often associated with soils derived from basalt, limestone, and shale throughout its natural range, particularly in semiarid regions. Soils in the order Mollisols are commonly associated with this species. Generally, the soils are poorly developed, stony, shallow, have low moisture-holding capacities, and are easily eroded, so that in many places little or no topsoil is present. Some of the soils are calcareous or adobic, often high in clays; are slightly alkaline; and have limy, cemented subsoils. The pH of these soils is generally around 8.0 and moisture availability to plants is low (21,43). Geology and physiography associated with Rocky Mountain juniper are varied. Throughout its range, it is often found on open exposed bluffs, rocky points, and southern exposures. It does best in sheltered areas, however, along ravines, and in canyons and draws. Its range extends from glaciated valleys in central British Columbia through the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to mesas and tablelands of the southwestern United States, and south into the Sierra Madre in Sonora, Mexico. It is found on lava beds in Idaho and eastern Washington, on limestone cliffs in southwestern Montana, on outcroppings of sandstone and limestone in the central Rocky Mountains, and on high limestone plateaus in South Dakota and Wyoming. It is common on northern aspects in the ""badland"" topography of both North and South Dakota. In the southern parts of its range Rocky Mountain juniper is often found on malpais derived from lava flows, and on Kaibab limestone plateaus in northern Arizona (42). The elevational range of Rocky Mountain juniper is from near sea level to 2740 m (9,000 ft); following the general plant geography rule of decreasing elevation with increasing latitude, the range varies considerably with latitude and local climate. Aspect also has an effect on local elevations, southern exposures generally having a wider range than corresponding northern exposures. For example, in Utah and Nevada, Rocky Mountain juniper has been reported ranging generally from 1070 to 2260 m (3,500 to 7,400 ft) on southern exposures and from 1160 to 1400 m (3,800 to 4,600 ft) on northern exposures (14,42).",Soils and Topography,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,15,1
"The early Indians made some use of juniper berries for food and decoration; the bark was woven into cradles and similar products as well as being used for torches. The most important use of Rocky Mountain juniper, however, was as firewood for cooking and heating, and today this is still a major use. Fuelwood volume tables that include Rocky Mountain juniper have been developed (14,30). The wood is fine grained, with white sapwood and deep red heartwood with faint purplish and whitish streaks. It is slightly lighter in weight and not as hard as that of eastern redcedar, but in color, odor, figure, and strength it could be substituted for its eastern counterpart. When cured, the wood, especially the heartwood, is resistant to decay; it has been cut heavily for fenceposts, particularly before the advent of steel fenceposts (14). The small size and rapid taper of the stems, with the consequent high cost of producing usable sawn material, have discouraged use for lumber. However, some sawn material has been cut from Rocky Mountain juniper for such use as closet lining, custom-built furniture, inlays, and cedar chests. The products are attractive; the colored heartwood also has been used for carvings and novelties, but only on a small scale (14,30).",Special Uses,Rocky Mountain Juniper,juniperus,scopulorum,conifer,16,1
"In its native range, rose gum grows in tall, open forests associated with the eucalypts E. intermedia, E. pilularis, E. microcorys, E. resinifera, and E. saligna, as well as Syncarpia glomulifera, Tristania conferta, and Casuarina torulosa. Rose gum also commonly grows on the fringes of and occasionally within rainforest (6). In Florida, rose gum plantations are most frequently established on palmetto prairies. The characteristic vegetation of palmetto prairies consists of a ground cover of Serenoa repens, Aristida stricta, Andropogon spp., Myrica pusilla, M. cerifera, Ilex glabra, and Quercus minima, with the scattered trees, Sabal palmetto, Quercus virginiana, and Pinus palustris (12).",Associated Forest Cover,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,1,0
"The climate in the Australian native range of rose gum is humid subtropical with mean minimum temperatures during the coldest month ranging from 2 to 10° C (36 to 50° F) and mean maximums near 29° C (85° F) during the hottest month. Rainfall averages 1020 to 1780 mm (40 to 70 in); it is concentrated in the summer, but monthly precipitation during the dry season is at least 20 mm (0.8 in) (10,21). Coastal areas are generally frost-free, but higher altitude, inland areas experience occasional frosts (6). Southwest Florida is humid and subtropical. Summers are long, rainy, and warm; winters are dry and mild but with the threat of damaging frost. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 1270 to 1400 mm (50 to 55 in). Monthly precipitation during the rainy season, June through September, averages about 180 to 200 mm (7 to 8 in). Rainfall during the dry season, November through April or May, averages 50 mm (2 in) per month (40). Dry-season rainfall is unreliable, however. Daily maximum temperatures from late May through September exceed 32° C (90° F) on most days but rarely reach 38° C (100° F). During the coldest month, daily maximum temperatures average near 24° C (75° F) and daily minimums near 11° C (52° F) (27). But swift continental cold fronts change balmy afternoons into dangerously cold nights. The lowest temperatures recorded in each of 30 winters averaged -4.4° C (24° F) (22).",Climate,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,2,0
"Rose gum is most closely related to E. deanei and E. saligna (6). No subspecies or varieties are recognized. Rose gum trees planted in southwest Florida constitute a land race developed through three generations of selection and progeny testing in the local environment. Because of recurrent selection for local adaptation, the trees perform better than progenies of outstanding trees selected in Australia, South Africa, or elsewhere. A long-range breeding system calls for importing as many rose gum seed lots as possible-preferably collections from selected single trees in Australia-but some bulk lots and many lots from exotic populations outside Australia have been included. Each seed lot (family) contributes about 60 seedlings to a large outplanting called the genetic base population. All individuals of all families are completely randomized in single-tree plots. Trees are measured for growth rate and scored for cold hardiness, stem straightness, branch habit, and general adaptation. At 2.7 years (one-third of the rotation age), the trees are selected and the rest are rogued to convert the base population to a seedling seed orchard. The best families usually contribute three or four selects to the seedling seed orchard; most families contribute only one or two; and about one-third of the families drop out of the breeding population for lack of any worthy candidates. Select trees exchange pollen in the first massive bloom at age 3+ years. The following spring the resultant seed is collected and used to establish the next generation's base population, which also is the progeny test of the seedling seed orchard. Thus, a generation of selection is completed in 4 years. Progeny test results identify the best commercial seed-orchard trees as well as poor seed trees to be rogued from the orchard. Each generation of selection enhances the land race's adaptation to local conditions, but new families must be imported to broaden the genetic base and minimize inbreeding depression. In the current genetic base population, first-generation Australian families average 7.5 dm³ (0.26 ft³) of stem volume at 2.5 years. Compared with those Australian families, second-generation Florida families average 95 percent more stem volume (14.6 dm³ or 0.52 ft³); third-generation families, 127 percent more (17.0 dm³ or 0.60 ft³); and fourth-generation families, 163 percent more (19.7 dm³ or 0.70 ft³). A study designed to measure realized gain compares the following three populations, each in replicated block plantings: Premier-Six advanced-generation families (average 3.5 generations of selection) that are top-ranked for the combined traits of volume production, cold hardiness, form, and coppicing. Commercial-The 33 advanced-generation families (average 2.9 generations) included in the seed mix for the 1979 commercial season. Ancestral-Four imported seed lots from which all six premier families descend and 21 of the 33 commercial families. At age 1.5 years both premier and commercial trees significantly exceeded the height of ancestral trees by 23 and 13 percent, respectively. The three populations all differed significantly in their cold hardiness. The premier families suffered mainly foliar damage, while the commercial and ancestral families suffered increasingly severe damage to foliage and woody parts.",Genetics,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,7,0
"The Florida land race is predominantly, but not purely, E. grandis. A few seed orchard trees and scattered offspring display recognizable admixtures of traits from E. robusta, E. tereticornis, and E. camaldulensis. Given synchronous flowering and proximity, rose gum can hybridize with many eucalyptus species. Some of the resultant F1, hybrids are superior to either parent species for certain exotic forest environments, but F2 and later generations show classic segregation and hybrid breakdown. F, hybrids between E. grandis and E. tereticornis seem especially promising in India (43) and Zambia (16). In Espirito Santo, Brazil, hybrids between E. grandis and E. urophylla are planted as clonal stands from rooted cuttings (8). In south Florida, there is evidence that F, hybrids between E. grandis and E. robusta could be more productive than either pure species.",Hybrids,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,9,0
"Over its central range, rose gum grows on alluvial or volcanic loams in valleys and flats within 160 krn (100 mi) of the coast, straddling the Queensland-New South Wales border from latitude 26 to 33° S. Two outlier populations extend the range to the Atherton Tablelands at latitude 13° S. (10,15). In Florida, intensive research on rose gum began in 1961and operational planting in 1972. Through the 1980 planting season, it was commercially planted on 5,650 ha (14,000 acres) in Glades, Hendry, and Charlotte Counties in southwest Florida between latitude 26° 31' and 27° 02' N. and between longitude 81° 31' and 81° 48' W. Outside that zone there are numerous potential planting areas in south Florida.",Native Range,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Rose gum, like all eucalypts, bears perfect flowers. Buds form in axillary umbels with usually seven buds per cluster. Each flower consists of a central style surrounded by stamens standing about 8 mm (0.3 in) tall and forming a bloom about 20 mm (0.8 in) in diameter. The puffy clusters of creamy white blooms are attractive and conspicuous but not of horticultural quality. The main blooming season is mid-August through late September, but some trees start blooming early in August and the latest finish in mid-November. This blooming season of late summer-early fall matches the low-elevation blooming season in South Africa but contrasts with the late fall-early winter bloom at high elevations (18) and the midwinter bloom in Australia (5). Each tree blooms serially over a period of 5 to 10 weeks, with an average of only 12 percent of a tree's bud crop in prime bloom during a given week. Foraging insects, particularly honeybees, pollinate the flowers. In an individual flower, the stigma is not receptive until after pollen shed, but because each tree blooms serially, there is, unfortunately, ample opportunity for self-fertilization. In a South African seed orchard, selfing occurred with a frequency of 10 to 38 percent, caused 10 recognizable detrimental abnormalities, and depressed the height growth of outplanted seedlings 8 to 49 percent compared to crossed progenies (19). Flowering precocity is strongly inherited; a few families bloom at plantation-age 1 year, many more at age 2, and 97 percent of the orchard at age 3. From 2 to 3 weeks after blooming, the stamens and style wither and fall away, leaving a woody, urn-shaped seed capsule closed by four to six valve covers. The capsules are about 8 mm long by 6 mm in diameter (0.3 by 0.25 in). Most umbels carry five to seven capsules to maturity. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed capsules are mature for harvest 6 or 7 months after flowering. However, the capsules remain closed on the tree for at least 1 year after maturity, so it is possible to gather two seed crops at a time by harvesting in alternate years. Seed capsules should be harvested by severing the umbel stalks; the alternative of clipping seed-bearing twigs reduces the next flower crop. The valves of the capsules dry out, open, and release seeds. Capsules scattered loosely on a dry surface release their seeds after about 2 hours in full sun. Commercial bulk lots can be extracted in about I week in chambers equipped with open-mesh shelves, heating from 30 to 35° C (86 to 95° F), forced-air circulation, and dehumidification. Individual trees bear from 3 to 25 sound seeds per capsule, with an average near 8 (20) and a much greater mass of infertile ovules called ""chaff."" Fertile seeds are tiny, only about I min (0.04 in) in diameter. Chaff particles are lighter colored and only minutely smaller and lighter than seeds. Seed cleaning involves sorting by size and shape through multiple sieves, then separating by weight in a pneumatic separator. In Florida, operational quantities of seeds can be harvested from an orchard at age 3.7 years and production increases annually to a plateau at about age 10. Seed production is reliable year to year, but there is great tree-to-tree variation in the quantity, purity, and viability of seed crops. The 1-year seed crop from some 7-year-old trees was as follows: Seeds have been successfullly stored for 20 years by either freezing at -8° C (18°F) or refrigerating at 10° C (50° F). Rose gum seeds require no presowing treatment. Seedling Development- Germination of rose gum is epigeal and takes place in 7 to 14 days after sowing (44). Moist, bare soil is required for natural regeneration; fire, erosion, and flood deposits provide satisfactory seedbeds. In commercial forests, the species is almost always regenerated by planting. Seedlings are usually raised to 20 to 30 cm (7.8 to 11.8 in) tall, which takes 3 to 5 months (29). Due to the sensitivity to desiccation, seedlings are normally grown in containers. Rigid containers with multiple cavities from which the seedlings are removed with roots and soil intact are almost always used in large operations. Seedlings are also grown in plastic nursery bags. In the absence of frost and drought, seedlings can be planted throughout the year. In many areas seedling production and planting must be carefully timed. In Florida, planting must coincide with summer rains to give sufficient time for seedlings to grow into hardy saplings before facing winter frosts. Site Preparation and Planting in Florida- Success in establishing rose gum in plantations depends on double chopping or cross disking to greatly reduce vegetative competition, then broadcasting 1.12 t/ha (0.5 ton/acre) of ground rock phosphate to overcome a severe natural phosphorus deficiency, and finally bedding to elevate the seedlings out of the standing water during the first rainy season (25). Saw-palmetto rhizomes are thick, fibrous, and deeply rooted, requiring heavy equipment for chopping and bedding. Landowners prepare sites in the spring when the deepening drought enhances the kill from chopping or disking. Also, spring offers little time or moisture for weed competition to colonize the beds before summer planting starts. Planting crews use high-clearance wheel tractors to straddle the beds and pull planting machines fitted with racks holding four cartons containing a total of 1,400 to 2,000 containerized seedlings. This number is sufficient to traverse several rows as long as I kin (0.6 mi). Recommended planting density is 1,495 seedlings per hectare (605 seedlings/acre) on beds spaced 3.7 in (12 ft) apart and seedlings spaced 1.8 in (6 ft) along the beds (26). In the first 2 years of machine planting, survival averaged 86 percent in an extremely wet season and 75 percent in a dry year. Survival after machine planting probably averages about 84 percent. Hand planting routinely achieves at least 95 percent survival. Vegetative Reproduction- After harvest, under favorable conditions, rose gum plantations regenerate by coppicing (sprouting) from the stumps. Two or three coppice rotations are commonly harvested before it is necessary to replant seedlings. Coppice shoots initially grow faster than seedlings, but that advantage is partially offset by stump mortality, which usually runs about 5 percent per rotation in South Africa (39). In many areas, coppice forms equally well regardless of the season of harvest. In Florida, however, it was shown that summer harvests (June-September) reduced coppicing ability. Vegetative propagation has been a difficult challenge. Cuttings from tiny seedlings root readily, but rooting capability ceases before seedlings are 1 in (3 ft) tall because of natural rooting inhibitors produced by adult leaves (32). However, even in adult trees, cuttings from epicormic shoots induced at the base of the tree by felling or girdling retain the ability to root. Rooting success varies substantially among clones, and there are strong seasonal influences and exacting cultural requirements for each geographic area. The technique is particularly advantageous in multiplying outstanding hybrid individuals. Starting in the mid-1970's, some commercial plantations were propagated by rooted cuttings in Brazil (8,17), where the method is now used to establish major clonal plantations (9). Reproduction through tissue culture techniques has also been demonstrated (38). Clonal seed orchards have been produced by grafting in South Africa, but delayed graft incompatibility is a common, debilitating problem. Incompatibility can be greatly reduced by grafting scions onto sibling or half-sibling rootstocks (45).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Growth of rose gum on short rotations is rapid. Mean height growth of 2 m/yr (6.5 ft) is common (29), and a rate of 4 m/yr (13 ft) has been reported (35). Mean yields are about 27 m³/ha/yr (386 ft³/acre/yr) (21). Wood increment on the best sites is even more impressive: average 3.5 m (11.5 ft) annually for the first 4 years, then taper off to average 2.4 in (7.9 ft) over an 8-year rotation. Adequately stocked commercial plantations have not reached harvest age, but preliminary growth data support the following planning assumptions: An 8-year seedling rotation. Trees averaging about 18 in (60 ft) tall at age 8 years. Annual yield for volume and weight in the following range: These indicated annual yields are well below world standards, and are probably due to south Florida's infertile soils and seasonally high water tables. Yields include about 18 percent bark by volume and 14 percent by weight. Density averages about 0.45 g/cm³ (0.026 oz/in³) for wood and about 0.32 g/cm³ (0.018 oz/in³) for bark. Moisture content is about 0.50 g/cm³ (0.029 oz/in³) for wood and 0.72 g/cm³ (0.042 oz/in³) for bark (14). Rooting Habit- Natural seedlings develop a pronounced taproot with few laterals if conditions permit. The roots of containerized seedlings more or less assume their natural form after being outplanted, regardless of previous restrictions (3). Rose gum does not develop lignotubers (6). The soils of south Florida drastically sculpture the root systems of rose gum trees. These spodosols feature a thin, sandy A, horizon with meager accumulations of nutrients and organic matter. Below lies a strongly leached A2 horizon of white, sterile sand. The A2 changes abruptly to a B2h, the spodic horizon, consisting of fine sand accreted with organic and aluminum compounds. In some areas this spodic hardpan perches water tables and resists root penetration both physically and by aluminum toxicity (4). Typically, taproots penetrate about 50 cm deep (20 in), then divide into two or more smaller taproots that terminate barely into the spodic horizon (4). Excavated trees show an abrupt fringe of dead lateral and feeder roots in the A2 horizon, apparently anoxia mortality from perched or raising water tables during the summer rainy season (4). This shallow anoxic zone restricts the exploitable soil during the prime summer growing season, and the roots cannot penetrate the spodic horizon to pursue the retreating water table during the long dry season. Reaction to Competition- Rose gum is intolerant of shade. Seedlings can only develop in full or nearly full sunlight; trees must maintain a dominant or codominant canopy position to long survive. Suppressed trees quickly die and intermediate trees must grow to an overstory position or eventually lose vigor and die. Despite their startling growth capacity, newly planted rose gum seedlings compete poorly with weedy vegetation, tolerating neither root competition nor shading. In Florida, they need 3 months reasonably free of competition to grow about 1.5 in (5 ft) tall and dominate the site. The local planting effort concentrates on virgin prairies and cutover pineland where chopping and bedding control the native ground cover sufficiently to permit rose gum establishment without post-planting weed control. However, early vegetative competition often retards growth and probably contributes to large tree-to-tree variation within stands. Post-planting weed control by herbicides and cultivation is beneficial (37). An increase in volume at 5 years of 48 to 55 percent was obtained by combinations of cultivation and herbicide spraying during the first 24 months (30). Competing vegetation also contributes to the fire danger. Rose gum completely occupies suitable sites in Florida with adequate stocking by plantation-age 2.5 years and herbaceous ground cover mostly disappears. On poor sites, intense competition may continue for 5 years. Competitive relationships develop early among the plantation trees and stay well defined throughout the 8-year rotation. In Florida's first commercial plantation, 75 percent of the sample trees that were in the top quartile for height at age 2.5 years were still in the top quartile at age 8.5 years; and 73 percent of the trees in the bottom quartile at age 2.5 were either dead or still in the bottom quartile at 8.5 years. Similarly, out of 131 sample crop trees at 8.5 years, 85 percent had been predicted as crop trees at 2.5 years; of 37 sample trees that were culls or dead at 8.5 years, 68 percent had been predicted as culls at 2.5 years. Damaging Agents- The greatest threat to rose gum survival is a lapse in soil moisture at outplanting time. If this occurs, managers must be prepared to stop planting until the rains begin again. Severe nursery losses have been suffered from a stem-girdling fungal canker caused by Cylindrocladium scoparium, but alternating sprays of chlorothalonil and benomyl prevent or control it (1). Severe frost damages rose gum saplings even in the commercial plantation zone, but they sprout and regrow vigorously. Frost has cost a season's growth several times but never a plantation. South Florida usually has inversion freezes, with lower temperatures at ground level than at 2 m (6.6 ft). There is a strong positive correlation between freeze resistance and rapid early growth; resistant trees develop larger stems with thicker, insulative bark close to the ground, and also elevate tender terminal tissue into the higher, warmer air. Each additional year of growth reduces the risk of frost damage. Since planting research began in 1961, severe damage has been suffered 1 out of 3 years by seedlings in their first winter, I out of 5 years by saplings in their second winter, and only 1 out of 19 years by trees in their third winter or older. Local plantations are suffering an increasing incidence of basal cankers caused by the fungus Cryphonectria cubensis. Canker incidence in the oldest pilot-scale plantation increased from 15 percent at age 7 to 50 percent at age 11 (2). Infected trees in Florida do not seem debilitated, but mortality has been serious in Brazil (30 percent) and Surinam (50 percent). Basal cankers may appear in trees less that 2 years old. Lightning occurs with an unusually high frequency in southwest Florida (36). Over an 8.5-year rotation on a 67-ha (165-acre) plantation, 4.4 percent of the sample trees suffered lightning strikes or splashes and 2.5 percent actually died as a result. No hurricane has struck southwest Florida since commercial planting began, but there is a 10-percent hurricane probability for any given year. A hurricane would cause serious windthrow, as hurricane Allen did to Eucalyptus in Jamaica (41). Termites which devour seedlings during the first years, have been a serious problem in rose gum plantations in India (28). Also worth mentioning is the serious tendency of rose gum logs to end-split. Losses can be kept at a minimum by milling within 3 days of cutting, bucking to lengths as long as possible, and sawing carefully (33).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,14,0
"This species grows on flats or lower slopes of deep, fertile valleys in Queensland and New South Wales. It grows best on moist, well drained, deep, loamy soils of alluvial or volcanic origin (6). Clayey soils are acceptable if they are well drained (23). The rose gum plantations in Florida lie in a physiographic region known as the Western Flatlands (11). Topography is nearly flat; elevations change almost imperceptibly from coastal sea level to 6, 12, or rarely 18 m (20 to 60 ft) elevation inland. Soils are almost exclusively members of the sandy, siliceous hyperthermic Haplaquods. Derived from marine deposits, these soils are mainly sands, strongly acid, poorly drained, and underlain by spodic horizons that are commonly impervious to root penetration and water drainage. The combination of high seasonal rainfall, flat topography, and low elevation results in high water tables, shallow root zones, and local inundation during the rainy season. Conversely, during the dry season these sandy soils rapidly become moisture deficient.",Soils and Topography,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,15,0
"The sapwood of rose gum is pale pink and the heartwood light to dark red. The wood is straight grained, coarse textured, and moderately strong (6). It is moderately durable at best, but the sapwood is generally resistant to Lyctus spp. borers (6,7). The specific gravity varies from 0.62 to 0.80 (6,7,23). Rose gum timber is used for general construction, joinery, plywood, panelling, boat building, flooring, utility poles, mine timbers, and posts (6,7). In 1972, rose gum wood harvested from an 8.5-ha (21-acre) research planting supported a commercial-scale trial run in a Florida pulpmill. A mixture of 70 percent rose gum and 30 percent native hardwood was manufactured into quality facial tissue with excellent properties of strength and softness (42). Earlier laboratory tests showed that debarked rose gum wood gave screened Yields of kraft bleached paper pulp equal to those of representative native hardwood furnish at comparable kappa numbers. Brightness of bleached pulp was equal or superior to native hardwood controls at equivalent or slightly higher processing costs (14). However, strength properties of handsheets were generally inferior to those of native hardwood controls. A pyrolysis test was conducted to determine the energy value that could be recovered from whole-tree chips of 9-year-old rose gum grown in southwest Florida. Seventy percent of the energy contained in the dry chips could be recovered as char and oil, which could be transported and stored. Twenty-one percent of the trees' energy value was converted to noncondensed volatile oil and low-energy gas that could only be used on site or sold to an adjacent user (34).",Special Uses,Rose Gum Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,grandis,hardwood,16,0

Each capsule contains up to 2,000 seeds, and a large tree may produce as many as 20 million seeds a year. The tiny, flat, winged seeds weigh about 0.17 mg (170,000 seeds/oz.). As the capsules break open on the trees throughout the winter and into spring, wind dissemination occurs easily (1). Seedling Development- The seeds of this species germinate quickly and grow rapidly when conditions are favorable. The seeds are not dormant, but laboratory studies have found that light is required for germination (1). Cold storage reduces the light requirement, however (7). Germination is epigeal. Like most pioneer species, P. tomentosa needs bare soil, sufficient moisture, and direct sunlight for good seedling establishment. Seedlings are very intolerant of shade. Vegetative Reproduction- Royal paulownia roots sprout easily. In fact, lateral root cuttings of 1-year-old seedlings can be used for propagation directly in the field (7).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Royal Paulownia,paulownia,tomentosa,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- On good sites royal paulownia grows rapidly. Plantation spacings of 1.2 by 1.2 or 1.8 by 1.8 m (4 by 4 or 6 by 6 ft) have been recommended; saw logs can be expected in 15 years. Heights at maturity range from 9 to 21 m (30 to 70 ft) (3,7). Heights of 13 m (43 ft) in 11 years have been reported in Russia. On poor sites, such as surface mine spoils, growth is considerably slower. The ability of royal paulownia to survive, grow, and reproduce on such harsh, exposed sites, however, has made it a favorite for revegetating surface mine areas. The tree thrives on dry southern aspects, even though it generally has a shallow root system (7). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Since royal paulownia is a naturalized exotic that is only now being planted, little is known about its silviculture. Like most pioneer species, however, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competing vegetation. Damaging Agents- No major insect pests are known for royal paulownia in the United States. Minor damage from several foliage diseases has been reported on the species. The most common, Phyllosticta paulowniae, produces small brown spots on the leaves, and two powdery mildews, Phyllactinia guttata and Uncinula clintonii, have also been found (4). No major disease problems have appeared yet in the United States.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Royal Paulownia,paulownia,tomentosa,hardwood,14,0
"Naturally seeded or planted royal paulownia survives and grows best on moist, well-drained soils of steep slopes or open valleys (3,7), but it will germinate and grow on almost any moist, bare soil.

"Royal paulownia was introduced into this country as an ornamental, and it still retains some popularity for that purpose. Its use in reclamation of the disturbed soils of surface mines grows yearly. The wood is highly prized for the manufacture of specialty items in Asia, and there is a brisk export business of logs to Japan. The export market has led to establishment of commercial plantations in this country.",Special Uses,Royal Paulownia,paulownia,tomentosa,hardwood,16,0
"In Australia, saligna eucalyptus is usually found in mixture with tallowwood eucalyptus (Eucalyptus microcorys) and blackbutt eucalyptus (E. pilularis), the main coastal species of New South Wales, and is also found associated with several other eucalypts. It seldom grows in pure stands, whereas the closely related rosegum eucalyptus is typically found in pure stands (13). The common names used follow those of Bryan and Walker (2). In Hawaii, saligna eucalyptus has been planted in mixture with three species of eucalyptus-tallowwood, robusta (Eucalyptus robusta), and rosegum-with melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), Formosa koa (Acacia confusa), horsetail casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia), silk-oak (Grevillea robusta), and a host of other species. On most sites, it has outgrown and shaded out or badly suppressed all of these species except the equally fast growing rosegum eucalyptus and the tolerant Formosa koa. In closed stands, about the only understory species found are strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) and occasional treefern (Cibotium spp.).",Associated Forest Cover,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,1,0
"In Australia, the tree grows from sea level to 300 In (1,000 ft) in the South and to 1220 m (4,000 ft) in the North. The climate within this range is warm-temperate to subtropical, with winter frosts to -15° C (5° F) at the higher elevations (12). In New Zealand, seedlings were frost tolerant to a minimum temperature of -7° C (21° F) (21). Rainfall is evenly distributed, or has a summer maximum, and ranges from 890 to 1270 mm (35 to 50 in) annually (13). In Hawaii, saligna eucalyptus grows well between elevations of about 150 m (500 ft) and 1100 m (3,600 ft) where the temperature is never below 4° C (40° F). One stand is at 1980 m (6,500 ft) where light winter frosts occasionally occur, and the average daytime temperature is about 16° C (60° F). Most of the saligna eucalyptus stands have been planted between 300 and 610 m (1,000 and 2,000 ft) elevation in locations with evenly distributed or winter maximum rainfall of 1520 to 7620 mm (60 to 300 in) annually. The tree achieves its best growth on sites with about 2540 mm (100 in) annual rainfall, rather than on wetter sites, possibly because sunlight is greatly reduced by the cloud cover on wetter sites.",Climate,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,2,0
"Because of the wide international interest and the problems of hybridization and identification of the two species, a comparison of E. saligna and E. grandis populations representative of the entire range of each species was made in Australia (4). Distinct differences were found in seedling and mature-tree morphology and allozyme frequencies between core populations of the two, but intermediate types were found in some remote locations. Core mature saligna eucalyptus had smaller seed, upright valves (4 per fruit), and non-glaucous fruit and branchlets as compared with E. grandis, which had larger seed, incurved valves in 5's, glaucous fruit and branchlets. Saligna eucalyptus seedlings had lignotubers and were glaucous; not so, E. grandis. Saligna eucalyptus seedlings also had smaller cotyledons and narrower, longer leaves. The allozyme patterns found for native populations in Australia showed species differences and were later compared to patterns found for populations collected in the Republic of South Africa, which were thought to be hybridized (5). All the South African trees sampled fell within the allozyme patterns found in Australia for E. grandis, even though several were morphologically suspect. In addition to the Eucalyptus grandis/E. saligna complex, E. saligna crosses with E. robusta, bangalay eucalyptus (E. botryoides), and probably with forest redgum eucalyptus (E. tereticornis) (12,28). In the southern part of its natural range, a region of introgression of E. saligna with E. botryoides exists (23).",Hybrids,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,9,0
"Saligna eucalyptus is native to the east coast of Australia from Bateman's Bay (lat. 36° S.) in southern New South Wales to the southeastern corner of Queensland (lat. 27° S.) (13). In the United States, it has been introduced into Florida, California, and Hawaii. In Hawaii it reproduces at the edges of planted stands. Although it was introduced into Hawaii in the late 1800's, the tree was not planted extensively until the 1960's, when it became the principal tree used for forestation.",Native Range,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,11,0
"In an attempt to solve the problem of confused and probably mixed introductions of Eucalyptus saligna and E. grandis, differences between them have been noted for mature trees in South Africa (12), as follows: These characteristics vary among provenances of each species. The northernmost provenances of saligna eucalyptus, for example, do not have lignotubers (12). When grown in some locations, for example, Hawaii, flowering seasons overlap and trees probably hybridize extensively. Among 6-year-old trees of provenances collected in Australia growing side-by-side at two locations in Hawaii, no consistent differences were observed between E. saligna and E. grandis in leaves, bark, or branching habit (26). Saligna eucalyptus produces denser wood than E. grandis, but in Hawaii (26), and also in the Republic of South Africa (9) where yields of the two species growing on the same sites have been compared, the best performing E. grandis provenances for a particular site produce a higher total weight yield than E. saligna, despite the wood density difference.",Population Differences,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,12,0
"Saligna eucalyptus grown in Hawaii regenerates naturally on bare soil immediately after logging, or on cultivated land adjacent to planted stands. It rarely becomes established in undisturbed grass or brush cover and never in its own shade. Coppicing of stumps is variable. Usually about half to two-thirds of the stumps will sprout (26). Age, weather, and (probably) heredity influence coppicing. The tree also usually produces a mass of special bud tissue at the groundline known as a lignotuber. The lignotuber will sprout if the stem is killed back by fire or other injury. Flowering and Fruiting- Saligna eucalyptus trees begin to flower at 3 to 4 years of age. Flowering in Hawaii is most prolific during January to March but occurs to some extent year round. In Australia, the tree also flowers from January to March; in California, from April to June. Flowers that consist of numerous stamen filaments surrounding a single shorter pistil occur in umbels of 4 to 9 flowers. Before opening, the flower buds are about 10 mm (0.4 in) long and 5 min (0.2 in) in diameter with a short stalk (pedicel), and a blunt, rather pointed cap (operculum) enclosing the stamens. Flowers are perfect. The opened flowers are yellowish white and are insect pollinated. Pollen is generally shed before the style becomes receptive, so selfing is rare. The fruit is a dark-brown, bell-shaped capsule 0.8 em (0.3 in) long and 0.5 cm (0.2 in) in diameter. It is short stalked and has four pointed, rim level, or slightly exserted valves. The capsule ripens about 6 months after flowering but opens to release seed 1 or 2 months after ripening (12,13,20). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds are black, irregularly shaped, and about 1.3 min (0.05 in) in diameter. They are released along with a large amount of reddish-brown chaff when the capsule valves open. There are 460 viable seeds per gram (13,000/oz) of seed plus chaff (20). Seeds are naturally dispersed by wind. They can be collected from ripe capsules dried to open after picking. Some unopened ripe capsules are always present on trees in Hawaii but are most common in August and September. Fresh seeds germinate readily in 10 to 20 days without pregermination treatment. Seeds can be stored in airtight containers for several years at 0° to 5° C (32° to 41° F) (20). Seedling Development- The seedling has obcordate (inverse heart-shaped) cotyledons that are home epigeously as in all eucalypts. Juvenile leaves are opposite for 3 or 4 pairs, then become alternate, short stalked and lanceolate, and 2.5 by 5.0 cm (1 by 2 in) in size. The adult leaves are alternate, stalked and lanceolate, tapering to a long point, 2.3 by 15 cm (1 by 6 in) in size (13). In Hawaii, nursery-grown seedlings in containers reach plantable size in 4 to 5 months. Although seedlings are hardy and will survive bare or open-rooted planting, planting of container-grown stock provides more assurance of success if the weather is dry just after planting. Under adverse conditions newly planted seedlings often desiccate and suffer leaf-drop, but such plants usually sprout from the lower stem and recover. When this dieback slows growth, additional weeding or maintenance usually is required to clear competition (32). Around the world, seeds usually are germinated in flats containing light-textured medium, and seedlings are transplanted into other containers after 6 to 8 weeks when a third pair of leaves begins to appear (12). Seeds also are sown directly into beds or tubes, but thinning of seedlings is usually required with this method because the small seeds are difficult to handle individually. Thinning requirements can be overcome by using pelletized seed and seeding devices (15,31). In Hawaii, saligna eucalyptus seedlings have been grown extensively in open beds. Because of their rapid growth, these seedlings usually are root pruned at 15-cm (6-in) depth at 6 months and top pruned at 8 months to a 30-cm (12-in) height. Bare root stock frequently has not survived well after field planting, and Hawaii's practice has now changed to growing seedlings only in polyethylene tubes (30). On favorable sites in Hawaii, planted seedlings grow to about 3 m (10 ft) in height in 1 year, and 3 to 5 in (10 to 16 ft) per year for the next 10 years. After clear cutting of a 44-year-old saligna eucalyptus plantation, natural seedlings that became established grew to saplings that averaged 9 cm (3.5 in) in d.b.h., and 11 rn (36 ft) in height, 22 months after logging. Several of these saplings were 18 m (59 ft) tall. Vegetative Reproduction- Saligna eucalyptus can sprout prolifically from dormant buds located in the cambium throughout the stem. After a tree is cut, shoots sprout from many points on the remaining bark surface. Those highest on the stump suppress those lower down and, if not broken off by wind or by weak attachment, become coppice stems that overgrow the stump (12). Sprouts will also grow from the lignotuber, a mass of bud tissue at or just below the groundline. Lignotubers are found on saligna eucalyptus from all but its northernmost provenances, but not on rosegum eucalyptus (12). In managing saligna eucalyptus for coppice, it is desirable to cut stumps 12 cm (5 in) or less in height, so that the sprouts will develop from near the lignotuber. Such sprouts generally are more firmly attached but are frequently suppressed by sprouts arising from higher on the stump. Lignotubers persist when stems are killed by shading, thinning, or fire and often sprout vigorously after a mature stand is cut (8). Rooting of cuttings of saligna eucalyptus had been difficult (16) until a method was developed at the Aracruz Co. in Brazil (7). The method consists of collecting coppice sprouts that are just beginning to harden and keeping them constantly moist while 2-leaf-pair cuttings are prepared and end-dipped in rooting hormone. The cuttings are placed under intermittent mist in individual containers. In Hawaii, saligna eucalyptus has been easier to root than E. grandis, although most success elsewhere has been with E. grandis (3,7). However, just as was found for E. grandis in Brazil (6), cutting rootability is variable among coppice from individual saligna eucalyptus trees. Tissue culture propagation has also been successful in Hawaii. The techniques used with saligna eucalyptus are essentially those reported by Boulay (1) for other eucalyptus species. Terminal and lateral shoot tips of greenhouse-grown rooted cuttings are multiplied, separated, and rooted in sterile culture, and afterwards grown to normal size in a mist chamber. A number of propagules of saligna eucalyptus produced by tissue culture are now being compared in clonal progeny tests. Grafting success has been reported for saligna eucalyptus (24,27). Cleft, side, splice, and bottle grafting were all used successfully, but the tests were not observed for a long enough period to determine the extent of long-term incompatibility, a problem with many species of Eucalyptus.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Saligna eucalyptus is a fast growing tree, well suited for producing high yields of wood fiber on short rotations. Measurements of a plantation spacing study on a good site at Kaumahina, Maui (29) provide an example. Four spacings were tested: 2.4 by 2.4 m, 3.0 by 3.0 in, 3.7 by 3.7 m, and 4.3 by 4.3 m (8, 10, 12, and 14 ft). At 2 years, trees averaged 9.6 cm (3.8 in) in d.b.h. and 10.7 rn (35 ft) in height. At 5 years, they had grown to 20.8 cm (8.2 in) in d.b.h. and 22.9 in (75 ft). Mean annual volume increment had already peaked at the two closer spacings in the study and was rapidly leveling out at the wider spacings. At 15 years, the trees in this study averaged 26.7 cm (10.5 in) in d.b.h. and 39 in (129 ft) tall. The largest tree was 61 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. and 49 rn (161 ft) tall. At 5 years, the trees at 2.4 by 2.4 m (8 by 8 ft) had produced 294 m³/ha (4,200 ft³/acre), or 58.8 m³/ha (840 ft³/acre) per year. At 15 years, these trees yielded 683 m³/ha (9,759 ft³/acre), or 45.6 m³/ha (651 ft³/acre) per year. Trees at 4.3 by 4.3 m (14 by 14 ft) yielded 33.1 m³/ha (473 ft³/acre) per year. These figures are comparable to those of Eucalyptus grandis/E. saligna grown in other countries. In Kenya, a mean annual increment over 5-year periods of 21 m³/ha (300 ft³/acre) for the seedling crop followed by 32 m³/ha (457 ft³/acre) for the first coppice crop was obtained (11). Other mean annual increment figures cited for E. grandis are 14 to 45 m³/ha (200 to 643 ft³/acre) in Uganda, 28 m³/ha (400 ft³/acre) in Zambia, 50 m³/ha (715 ft³/acre) at 14 years in Argentina, and 22 m³/ha (314 ft³/acre) in New South Wales, the native habitat of both species (12). In two 4-year-old stands in Hawaii, annual increment averaged 13 and 36 m³/ha (185 and 515 ft³/acre). The faster growing stand yielded wood with a specific gravity of 0.41 for an estimated annual dry-weight yield of stem wood of 15 tonnes/ha (6.7 tons/acre). The tallest tree in Hawaii, thought to be the tallest hardwood in the United States, is a saligna eucalyptus. When last measured in 1979, the tree was about 50 years old, 137 cm. (54 in) in d.b.h. and 82.3 m (270 ft) tall. Rooting Habit- Saligna eucalyptus develops roots throughout the soil profile so that it is quite windfirm on deep soils, but easily windthrown on shallow soils. It does not produce a taproot. Roots are primarily from the stem below the lignotuber, although layering sometimes occurs a short distance from the lignotuber on buried stems. In plantations in Hawaii that are not subject to periodic short drought, about two-thirds of the root system is confined to the upper 61 cm (24 in) of soil where most of the available nutrients are found. In plantations subject to occasional drying of the surface soil, the shallow roots are killed and a deeper root system develops. Reaction to Competition- Because the tree is such a fast starter, planted seedlings can frequently grow faster than surrounding grass and herbaceous vegetation and shade it out. This is particularly true if the seedlings have an intact root system when planted, as in modern tube container planting, so that little or no ""shock"" occurs to delay new growth after planting. At the upper elevational boundaries of sugarcane fields, saligna eucalyptus grown from seed in the soil at the time of cane harvest actually outgrew the sugarcane ratoon crop. In Hawaii, original plantings are made on completely cleared land. Pre-emergent herbicides, though effective, have rarely been used. If pre-emergents are not used, one cleaning around trees that require it is made after 3 months and, depending on the site, a second cleaning may sometimes be made at 6 months. Further weeding is seldom necessary. Coppice growth of saligna eucalyptus is so rapid that competing plants are rarely a problem after cutting. Tests in Hawaii show that the leguminous tree Albizia falcataria outgrows saligna eucalyptus on some sites when planted row on row with both species equally fertilized. It is one of the few woody plants known that can grow this fast on sites that are suited for saligna eucalyptus. The trials of mixing the legume with E. saligna produced increased yields of the eucalypt on some wet sites, but reduced yields on other, drier sites (10). In South Africa, thinning schedules have been developed for trees planted at 1330/ha (538/acre) that call for thinning 25 percent of the stems present at 6 years when the stems removed are 13 cm (5 in) in diameter, and 25 percent again at 10 years when they are 20 cm (8 in) (12). These thinnings are continued at 3- to 5-year intervals until a sawtimber harvest is made at age 30. In the interim, all stumps are allowed to coppice to keep the site free of competition and to supply fuelwood crops. Saligna eucalyptus is classed as very intolerant of shade and the slower growing trees in a stand quickly become suppressed. In Hawaii, crown closure is usually complete and crown differentiation begins in 3 years in stands planted at 3 by 3 in (10 by 10 ft). In coppice stands where numerous stems grow from every stump, crown differentiation begins as soon as sprouts appear. Many studies have shown that the maximum yield of wood is obtained by not thinning coppice at all (12). However, if larger diameter and straighter stems are desired, thinning to one to three stems per stump is desirable. Damaging Agents- Saligna eucalyptus grown in plantations in many parts of the world is susceptible to the eucalyptus canker disease, Cryphonectria cubensis. The disease kills young trees, deforms stems, and causes basal cankers that reduce the coppicing ability of stumps (19). Rosegum eucalyptus is somewhat resistant and Eucalyptus urophylla, perhaps, is immune to the disease, so these species are now being used in place of E. saligna in many Brazilian plantings. In Hawaii, the disease is present only on the island of Kauai. It attacks E. grandis in Florida but is not causing serious damage (18). In Western Australia, two other canker diseases, Botryosphaeria ribis and Endothia havaensis, were determined to be pathogenic on E. saligna planted there, while another, Cytospora eucalypticola, was present but less damaging (14). Phoracantha semipunctata, a wood-boring insect, degrades wood and reduces growth of eucalyptus in many places, including Hawaii, but is only a serious problem in trees that are stressed by severe drought. In Australia, saligna eucalyptus is subject to damage by Spondyliaspis psyllids, which predispose the trees to attack by the wood-boring beetle Xyleborus truncatus (22). In Hawaii, wind damage is a severe problem. In January 1980, a severe windstorm caused severe blowdown in 75 percent of the saligna eucalyptus stands planted during the 1960's (17).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,14,0
"In the northern part of its range in Australia, saligna eucalyptus extends to the slopes and ridges. In northern New South Wales and Queensland, it is usually on the slopes, while the closely related rosegum eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) is usually near or at the valley bottoms. Saligna eucalyptus does best on clay loams derived from shales and requires good drainage (13). In Hawaii, saligna eucalyptus has been planted extensively on Histosols and Inceptisols on the island of Hawaii, and also on the Oxisols and Ultisols of Maui, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai. These soils have in common moderate to strong acidity, low to very low available nitrogen and phosphorus, and rapid to very rapid drainage. All are formed on basaltic parent material, either volcanic ash or rock. In other respects they differ considerably, but all are unsuited or only marginally suited for agriculture. Slopes are usually 10 to 20 percent.",Soils and Topography,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,15,0
"In Hawaii, saligna eucalyptus has been used to some extent for sawtimber, but only with considerable difficulty and expense. Most of the milling and lumber quality problems are those associated with growth stress-severe end-splitting of logs, spring of cants during sawing, compression failures, and brashness of the wood near the pith (25). Because of this, the tree is now planted primarily for early harvest as pulpwood, or, if it proves economic in the near future, as industrial fuelwood to replace oil. Elsewhere in the world, particularly in South Africa and Brazil, the trees and their close relative, E. grandis, are grown extensively for pulp, poles, and fuel.",Special Uses,Saligna Eucalyptus,eucalyptus,saligna,hardwood,16,0
"The sand pine scrub of north-central Florida is one of the most distinctive plant communities of the State. Of particular interest is the sharpness of the boundaries with the adjacent sandhill vegetation which is dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), turkey oak (Quercus laevis), and pineland threeawn (Aristida stricta). Even-aged Ocala sand pine dominates the overstory, while the understory is composed almost entirely of evergreen shrubs 1.8 to 3.0 m (6 to 10 ft) tall. There is little or no herbaceous ground cover. Shrubs found in this understory include sand live oak Quercus virginiana var. geminata), myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia), Chapman oak (Q. chapmanii), rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), tree lyonia (Lyonia ferruginea), scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia), saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens), silk bay (Persea borbonia var. humilis), gopher-apple (Chrysobalanus oblongifolius), and ground blueberry (Vaccinium myrsinites). Mats of lichens (Cladonia spp.) are often plentiful on the ground beneath the trees and shrubs (14). The west Florida sand pine scrub is a distinct contrast to that of the north-central area. Here Choctawhatchee sand pine generally grows in uneven-aged stands and invades adjacent forested sites if protected from uncontrolled fire. The understory in these stands is quite sparse. Turkey oak, bluejack oak (Q. incana), sand post oak (Q. stellata var. margaretta), pineland threeawn, and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) are the most common species of this understory. Sand pine is the principal component of the forest cover type Sand Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 69) (12). It may also be found in several additional cover types such as Longleaf Pine (Type 70), Longleaf Pine-Scrub Oak (Type 71), and Slash Pine (Type 84).",Associated Forest Cover,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,1,1
"The climate of north-central Florida is characterized by hot summers with abundant precipitation and mild, rather dry winters. Precipitation varies from 50 to 75 mm (2 to 3 in) per month from October until April to as much as 200 to 230 mm (8 to 9 in) per month in June, July, and August. About 55 percent of the average rainfall of 1350 mm (53 in) occurs in the 4 months from June through September. Temperature extremes of -11° and 41° C (12° and 105° F) have been recorded. A frost-free period of 290 days is normal. Choctawhatchee sand pine thrives in western Florida under climatic conditions that are somewhat different from those of north-central Florida. Rainfall from December through May averages 100 to 110 mm (4 to 4.5 in) per month. It is hot and humid from June through September but slightly less so than in the north-central area. About 43 percent of the average annual rainfall of 1520 mm (60 in) occurs during this period of the year. October and November are the driest months, with rainfall averaging about 75 mm (3 in) per month. Temperature extremes of -17° and 42° C (2° and 107° F) have been recorded.

"The two geographic races of sand pine have been identified earlier in this paper. Natural hybridization of sand pine has not been known to occur, but several successful attempts at artificial hybridization have been reported. The most encouraging of these efforts is a cross between Virginia pine (P. virginiana) and the Choctawhatchee variety of sand pine produced at the Institute of Forest Genetics at Placerville, CA, in 1953. Seedlings from this cross were planted in Charles County, MD. At age 10, 94 percent (47 trees) of the hybrid seedlings had survived, with an average height of 5.4 m (17.6 ft). Survival of the Virginia pine controls averaged 84 percent with an average height of 4.8 in (15.6 ft). These results indicate the feasibility of moving sand pine germ plasma into more northerly locations through hybridization with Virginia pine (20). Attempts to move sand pine north of its natural range without benefits of hybridization are also encouraging. Identical studies in the Georgia and South Carolina sandhills show that sand pines grow better than loblolly, longleaf, and slash pine (P. elliottii) on these deep, droughty, infertile sands. Heights at age 15 years averaged 10.8 m (35.4 ft) for Choctawhatchee sand pine, 10.0 m (32.8 ft) for Ocala sand pine, and 7.32 m (24.0 ft), 7.25 m (23.8 ft), and 6.9 m (22.6 ft) for slash pine, longleaf pine, and loblolly pine. Ice storms have caused the most serious damage to the Ocala plantings, but damage to the Choctawhatchee plantings from these same storms has been no greater than that done to longleaf and slash pine. The growth rate of Choctawhatchee sand pine included in these tests is comparable to that for plantations of this variety growing in northwest Florida (13). Several organizations have attempted a number of additional crosses with sand pine and other species of pine (20). Slash pine x Ocala sand pine crosses were generally unsuccessful. Reported crosses in which the sand pine parent was not identified by variety included these: P. taeda x P. clausa P. clausa x P. taeda P. banksiana x P. clausa P. clausa x P. banksiana P. rigida x P. clausa P. clausa x P. rigida P. pungens x P. clausa P. pinaster x P. clausa P. clausa x P. pinaster P. echinata x P. clausa P. clausa x P. echinata P. virginiana x P. clausa P. clausa x P. virginiana P. thunbergii x P. clausa P. clausa x P. clausa With the exception of P. virginiana x P. clausa and P. clausa x P. virginiana, these crosses produced few sound seeds per cone. The P. virginiana x P. clausa cross produced an average of 13.1 sound seeds per cone, a yield that compares favorably with the results of many artificial intraspecific crosses. If such results are generally obtainable, mass production of this hybrid may be possible (20).",Genetics,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,7,1
"Sand pine is one of the minor southern pines with a natural range limited almost entirely to Florida. The largest sand pine concentration is a block of the Ocala variety covering about 101 170 ha (250,000 acres) in north-central Florida, an area often referred to as the ""Big Scrub."" This variety of sand pine also grows in a narrow strip along the east coast of Florida from St. Augustine southward to Fort Lauderdale. On the Gulf Coast small tracts of Ocala sand pine can be found scattered from a few kilometers north of Tampa southward to Naples. The less abundant Choctawhatchee variety is found growing along the coast in western Florida from Apalachicola to Pensacola and extending westward into Baldwin County, AL. Natural stands of Choctawhatchee sand pine are most abundant in Okaloosa and Walton Counties, FL, covering an area of about 40 470 ha (100,000 acres). Scattered stands of this variety of sand pine can be found 32 to 40 km (20 to 25 mi) inland from the coast in this section of Florida. Sparse stands of sand pine are also found on many of Florida's offshore islands (15,24). - The native range of sand pine.",Native Range,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Sand pine is monoecious. Flower buds are formed early in the summer but do not become visible until early autumn. The time when staminate flowers ripen, as shown by pollen release, is one of the more reliable phenological events distinguishing the two varieties of sand pine. Ocala sand pine grows throughout most of the peninsula of Florida between latitude 26° and 30° N. At the southern end of its range it may start shedding pollen as early as mid-November but could start a month or more later in northern Florida. In plantations of Ocala in northwest Florida, pollen generally is shed from the last weeks of December through mid-January. By contrast, the Choctawhatchee variety of sand pine grows naturally only in northwest Florida, essentially within 1 degree of latitude. Pollen dissemination by this variety may start as early as the last week of December and end as late as mid-March but occurs most frequently from late January through February. There is little overlap in the periods when the two varieties shed pollen (6). Conelet development is minimal during the first year but increases rapidly during the second year. Cones attain mature size by late summer. Seed Production and Dissemination- Sand pine bears cones at an early age. It is not unusual to find mature cones on 5-year-old trees. Occasionally flowers, usually pistillate strobili, are produced by 9- to 10-month-old seedlings growing under nursery conditions. The two varieties of sand pine differ appreciably in cone production, cone size, seed size, and several other characteristics. An abundant crop of cones is produced by Ocala sand pine almost annually. Choctawhatchee cone crops of similar size are produced at 4- to 6-year intervals, with light crops in intervening years. Other differences of note are listed in table 1 (2). The majority of Ocala sand pine cones are serotinous: they remain closed when mature and require heat to open. Consequently, seed dispersal is minimal. The cones are very persistent and may accumulate in large numbers on a single tree. Viability of the seeds in such cones decreases with age; only 10 to 20 percent of the seeds in 5-year-old cones may be viable. Seeds from cones 2 or more years old have also been shown to be relatively dormant as compared to newer seeds (24). Overly dense, unmanaged stands of the Ocala sand pines have developed following wildfire, which causes the cones to open and release large quantities of seeds (11). Regeneration methods based on cone serotiny have had limited success. Stands to be regenerated are clearcut, the slash and residual vegetation are chopped, and mineral soil is exposed with site preparation equipment such as rolling drum choppers. Cones in close proximity to the soil open and release their seeds when exposed to high surface soil temperatures. Uniform distribution of seeds from treetops is difficult to attain, and poorly regenerated stands often result. Direct seeding at a rate of 0. 56 to 1. 12 kg/ha (0. 5 to 1. 0 lb/acre) after site preparation has been the most practical and successful regeneration method. This operation is most successful if the seeds are distributed from October through January and covered with about 6 mm (0.25 in) of soil shortly after being distributed (16). Seed dissemination of Choctawhatchee sand pine differs from that of Ocala sand pine. The majority of Choctawhatchee cones open when mature and most of the seeds are disseminated during September, October, and November. In western Florida the prevailing winds during the fall are from the west and northwest, and consequently seeds are distributed more evenly and to a greater distance on the eastern and southeastern sides of stands of seed-bearing age. It has been reported that along the western edge of a plantation, sand pine seedlings became established in the scrub oak-wiregrass cover for a distance of only 23 m (75 ft), or approximately 1.5 times average tree height (16.5 m or 54 ft at age 28). East of this plantation, reproduction was established in sufficient numbers to form a well-stocked stand for a distance of 38 m (125 ft). Occasional Choctawhatchee sand pine seedlings were noted beyond the bounds of the sample area (105 m or 345 ft) in all but a northwesterly direction from the seed source (7). Regeneration of this variety of sand pine may be accomplished quite simply. Cuttings can be timed to take advantage of its seed-dissemination characteristics, and as the seedlings can become established in competition with both understory and overstory vegetation, a natural system such as the shelterwood is a comparatively reliable and inexpensive regeneration method (5). Seedling Development- Seedlings of the two varieties of sand pine differ markedly in their development, but germination of both is epigeal. Peak germination of Ocala seed occurs within 10 days after the seed is sown in the nursery, while Choctawhatchee seed requires 17 to 21 days. The Ocala seedlings grow more rapidly than Choctawhatchee and are often 38 to 46 cm (15 to 18 in) tall at the end of the growing season. Choctawhatchee seedlings usually attain an average height of about 25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 in) in the same period of time. This difference in rate of height growth may continue for 2 to 3 years after the seedlings have been transplanted to the field; however, average annual height growth of both varieties is essentially identical by the time the trees are 4 to 5 years old. Maximum germination of seed distributed naturally or by direct seeding occurs from November through January for both varieties. Root development is rapid, and, as a result, seedling mortality is especially low when seedlings become established on bare areas during this period of the year. Germination from natural seed dispersal or direct seeding may occur at any time of the year, but few seeds disseminated during the summer months produce seedlings. High soil temperature may be a limiting factor. Surface soil temperatures as high as 72° C (162° F) have been observed in June and July on sandhill sites in Florida (8,24). Two flushes of growth are common during the first year of seedling development. The first occurs early in spring and the second usually in September and October. This growth characteristic is of special significance to the nurseryman. Sand pine seedlings, especially the Choctawhatchee variety, typically are only 10 to 13 cm (4 to 5 in) tall as late in the growing season as mid-August. Nothing need be done to stimulate such seedlings to attain plantable size as 1-0 seedlings. The application of nitrogen at this time produces exceptionally large, often succulent seedlings that are difficult to plant and not well suited to the rigors of the sandhill environment (4). Once established in the field, 3- to 4-year-old sand pines typically have three and occasionally four growth flushes during a single growing season. The fourth elongation generally occurs early in fall and is triggered by favorable soil moisture conditions. Birds, mammals, and insects cause the greatest losses of sand pine seeds and damage to newly germinated seedlings. The primary predators change with the season; losses attributed to migratory birds are greatest during spring and fall, while losses to insects and small mammals increase during the spring and summer as their numbers increase. Ants are more numerous and probably more destructive than all other insects. Birds and ants may be responsible for most seedling losses to predators (8). Vegetative Reproduction- Sand pine does not reproduce vegetatively. Seedlings of the Choctawhatchee variety do produce poorly developed basal branches. When 1- to 2-year-old seedlings are injured or decapitated, one or more of these basal branches may elongate and replace the lost terminal. Sand pine has been successfully grafted by several methods. Scion material from both sand pine varieties obtained from 20- to 60-year-old trees has been grafted successfully to potted slash, Ocala sand, and Choctawhatchee sand pine root stock as well as to root stocks of these same species growing in nursery beds. A wedge or cleft graft is commonly used (3).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Sand pine varies in size from the unmerchantable scrub growing on the coastal sand dunes of Florida to trees that attain saw-log size on the better sites. Trees ranging from 51 to 66 cm (20 to 26 in) in d.b.h. and 23 to 26 m (75 to 85 ft) in height are found on the best sites but smaller sizes are more common. The largest sand pine in Florida, for example, is 63 cm (24.8 in) in d.b.h. and 31.4 (103 ft) tall. Most of the volume of sand pine is currently being harvested for pulpwood, but the construction lumber market is a good potential outlet for some of the volume of sand pine. Formerly, tree size may have been a deterrent to its use for structural lumber, but improved sawmill equipment can now handle large volumes of small logs 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in) in diameter inside bark to produce lumber suitable for construction purposes. Both varieties have sufficient density for this use. Actually the density of Choctawhatchee is somewhat higher than that of Ocala. It could be put to structural uses similar to those of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (P. echinata) pines because the specific gravity of all three is in the same range (22). On the best sites, site index 24.4 m or 80 ft (age 50 years), the dominant trees in Ocala sand pine stands are expected to average 38 to 46 cm (15 to 18 in) in d.b.h. and 24 m (80 ft) in height. On average sites, site index 18.3 m or 60 ft, the dominant trees should average 25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 in) in d.b.h. and 18 m (60 ft) in height. The dominant stand on the poor sites, site index 15.2 m or 50 ft, is expected to average 18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 in) in d.b.h. and 15 m (50 ft) in height when mature. In well-stocked natural stands of Ocala sand pine, yields of 126, 94, and 63 m³/ha (20, 15, and 10 cords/acre) are predicted for high, average, and poor sites, respectively, at a rotation age of 40 to 45 years (21). These stands tend to break up markedly when they are 50 to 60 years old. Yield tables or site index curves have not been prepared for Choctawhatchee sand pine but a limited amount of information is available. Well-stocked natural stands are expected to produce 210 m³/ha (15,000 fbm/acre) of merchantable sawtimber plus 63 m³/ha (10 cords/acre) of pulpwood (5). Yields of Choctawhatchee plantations are expected to exceed the volumes reported above for Ocala sand pine. On the basis of data obtained from a very limited number of 25-year-old plantations, merchantable volumes for high, average, and poor sites, to a 7.6-cm (3-in) diameter outside bark, are anticipated to be 252, 189, and 126 m³/ha (40, 30, and 20 cords/acre) for 25- to 30-year rotations. Rooting Habit- Sand pine seedlings grown on very sandy sites develop a very fine root system with numerous laterals. The root system is somewhat coarser when the seedlings are grown on heavier textured soils; however, sand pine root systems are generally much finer and have greater development of lateral roots than is typical of other southern pines. Information is lacking on the rooting habit of sand pine older than seedlings. Reaction to Competition- Sand pine has been rated as being moderately intolerant of shade and competition, but in its early establishment it is quite tolerant. Overall, it probably is most accurately classed as having intermediate tolerance to shade. Sand pine expresses very little dominance in its usual growth pattern. Sand pine grows and persists in very dense stands of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 trees per hectare (8,000 to 10,000/acre). Seedlings of both varieties can be planted or will become established from seed in the scrub oak-wiregrass rough common to the Florida sandhills and eventually dominate the site. Natural pruning is very slow. Dead lateral branches may persist within a few feet of the ground until the trees are 20 to 25 years old. Damaging Agents- Insects, disease, and fire play a significant role in the development of sand pine stands. Several species of insects attack and kill, deform, or cause growth losses of sand pine. Most of these pests, the majority of which also attack the other species of pine growing in Florida, are found throughout the range of sand pine. Bark beetles, primarily Ips (Ips calligraphus and I. grandicollis), probably cause the greatest volume loss in sand pine, especially the Choctawhatchee variety. Generally, stress factors such as severe drought, lightning, fire, mechanical damage, or crowded stand conditions are associated with Ips beetle attacks. The sand pine sawfly (Neodiprion pratti) is considered a potential cause of growth loss in sand pine. Plantations of both varieties of sand pine have been defoliated by this insect. Attacks are reported to be most severe along stand edges and in plantations with fewer than 750 trees per hectare (300/acre) (27). Outbreaks of the blackheaded pine sawfly (N. excitans) on sand pine, concurrent with localized outbreaks of this sawfly on loblolly pine in northwest peninsular Florida, have also been reported (26). The pitch-eating weevil (Pachylobius picivorus) and the pales weevil (Hylobius pales) could become important insect pests of sand pine, but future losses will depend on management practices. Tip moths (Rhyacionia spp.), aphids, and scales have all been observed on sand pine but are not known to cause mortality or appreciable growth loss. These insects do cause a certain amount of deformity and discoloration of young trees and could cause significant losses where the objective of management is Christmas tree production. The southern pine coneworm (Dioryctria amatella) frequently damages twigs and cones, and if uncontrolled may cause substantial losses in seed orchards and seed production areas (9). Sand pine varies in its susceptibility to disease. Mushroom root rot caused by Clitocybe tabescens is found in natural stands of Ocala sand pine in central Florida and also has developed in Ocala plantations in northwest Florida and southern Georgia during the past 5 to 10 years (18). As a result of this disease, a significant portion of many Ocala plantations may not reach merchantable size. The Choctawhatchee variety is considered resistant to this disease. Phytophthora cinnamomi is reported to be a virulent pathogen on seedlings of both the Ocala and Choctawhatchee varieties of sand pine, but there is no conclusive proof that this fungus is a pathogen of sand pine under field conditions. Heavy clay or poorly drained soils may support populations of P. cinnamomi. The areas of Florida and Georgia where planted sand pines have been killed by Clitocybe tabescens and where Phytophthora cinnamomi was later recovered were either shallow soils underlain by clay or were imperfectly drained sandy soils. Such soil conditions are not characteristic of a sand pine site. Eastern gall rust (Cronartium quercuum), which forms spherical galls mainly on twigs and branches of both sand pine varieties, is common but seldom a serious problem. Heart rot caused by Phellinus pini has been reported in sand pine but is usually not a problem until the stands are more than 40 years old (19). Fire is probably the principal enemy of sand pine, which is much less fire resistant than longleaf or slash pine. Hot ground fires which produce substantial needle scorch kill as readily as crown fires, yet sand pine can be burned under controlled conditions. This is especially true of Choctawhatchee variety, as its natural understory vegetation tends to be less flammable than that generally found in natural stands of the Ocala variety. A unique combination of fuel and weather conditions appears to be responsible for the occasional blowup fires that occur in Ocala sand pine forests. The moisture content of sand pine needles is often lowest in March, and their resin and energy contents reach a yearly high from February through May. This condition is known as the ""varnish stage"" by those familiar with fire in Ocala stands. These fuel properties take on critical importance when they are combined with severe drought conditions and blustery spring weather characterized by unstable air masses, low relative humidity, and high winds. The relation between Ocala sand pine and fire is somewhat of a paradox. Many acres of Ocala sand pine forest owe their existence to fire which releases seed from the serotinous cones. As a considerable volume of timber may be lost to such fires, however, this method of regeneration cannot be considered an acceptable form of management (11).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,14,1
"Sand pine grows on well-drained to excessively drained, infertile, acid to strongly acid sandy soils of the order Entisols. This sand is of marine origin, much of which was deposited in terraces developed during the Pleistocene epoch. Most Ocala sand pine grows in the division of Florida known as the Central Highlands. Elevations range from less than 6 m (20 ft) above sea level near Lake George to nearly 61 m (200 ft) in the highest areas of this region. Numerous lakes dot this area and are indicative of the presence of soluble limestone not far below the surface. Gentle rolling hills characterize the terrain. The major soils on which Ocala sand pine grows, in order of importance, are the Astatula, Paola, and St. Lucie series (1). In west Florida, scattered stands of Choctawhatchee sand pine grow on the excessively drained soils of the Coastal Lowlands; however, the majority of such stands are in the division of Florida known as the Western Highlands (10). Elevations range from near sea level to nearly 90 m (295 ft) above sea level. The terrain of this area is typified by long, gentle slopes and broad, nearly level ridgetops. Sloping to steep hillsides border most of the streams and small lakes of the area. The water level of the rivers, lakes, and intermittent ponds of the area fluctuates considerably according to the amount of rainfall and seepage from the surrounding deep, sandy soils. Soils common to this region include the Kershaw and Lakeland series.",Soils and Topography,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,15,1
"Using sand pine for fuelwood or biomass plantations is feasible. Production levels comparable to those attained by other biomass species can be produced in plantations established at spacings of 0.6 by 1 m (2 by 3 ft). Annual dry weight yields of 7.13 t/ha (3.18 tons/acre) have been produced on 17-year-old Choctawhatchee sand pine plantations (17). Some sand pines, especially the Choctawhatchee variety with its short, heavily foliated branches and dark green needles, are being grown for Christmas trees. Marketable trees 2 to 3 m (7 to 10 ft) tall can be produced in 4 to 5 years.",Special Uses,Sand Pine,pinus,clausa,conifer,16,1
"Sassafras is included in only two forest cover types; however, scattered trees of the species are found in many eastern forest types (13). Sassafras-Persimmon (Society of American Foresters Type 64) is a temporary type common on abandoned farmlands throughout the range of sassafras, especially in the lower Midwest and, to a limited extent, the mid-Atlantic States. It is also present as successional stands on old fields in the Southeastern States where pine usually predominates. Sassafras is a minor component in Bear Oak (Type 43), a scrub type appearing on dry sites along the Coastal Plain from New England southward to New Jersey, and from northwestern New Jersey southward to scattered localities in western Virginia and eastern West Virginia. It is also prevalent in eastern and central Pennsylvania. Additional common associated tree species are sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), elms (Ulmus spp.), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), hickories (Carya spp.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). In fields with deeper soils it grows with elms, ashes (Fraxinus spp.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and oaks (Quercus spp.). Noteworthy minor tree associates are American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya uirginiana), and pawpaw (Asimina triloba). On poorer sites, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains, it is frequently associated with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), red maple (Acer rubrum), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), and several oaks. At the northern edge of its range, sassafras is found in the understory of aspen (Populus spp.) and northern pin oak Quercus ellipsoidalis) stands (8).",Associated Forest Cover,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,1,0
"Average annual rainfall varies from 760 to 1400 mm (30 to 55 in) within the humid range of sassafras. Of this, 640 to 760 mm (25 to 30 in) occur from April to August, the effective growing season. At the northern limits of the range, the average annual snowfall is between 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 in), while in the southern limits there may be only 2.5 cm (1 in) or less. The average frost-free period is from 160 to 300 days. In January average temperatures are -7° C (20° F) in the north and 13° C (55° F) in the south; the average July temperatures vary from 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F).",Climate,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,2,0

"Sassafras is native from southwestern Maine west to New York, extreme southern Ontario, and central Michigan; southwest in Illinois, extreme southeastern Iowa, Missouri, southeastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas; and east to central Florida (8). It is now extinct in southeastern Wisconsin but is extending its range into northern Illinois (5). -The native range of sassafras",Native Range,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Sassafras is dioecious. Greenish-yellow flowers appear in March and April as the leaves unfold. They develop in loose, drooping few-flowered axillary racemes. The fruit, 8 to 13 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long, is a single-seeded dark-blue drupe. It matures in August and September of the first year. The fruit is borne on a thickened red pedicel, and the pulpy flesh covers the seed. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production begins when trees approach 10 years of age and is greatest when trees are 25 to 50 years old.Good seed crops are produced every 1 or 2 years (2). There are 8,800 to 13,200 seeds/kg (4,000 to 6,000/lb) and soundness is 35 percent. Birds are principal agents of seed dissemination, with water a secondary agent. Some seeds probably are distributed by small mammals. Seedling Development- Sassafras seed usually remains dormant until spring, although some early maturing seed may germinate in fall. The limit for storage of sassafras in the forest floor is about 6 years (15). Stratification for 120 days in moist sand at 5° C (41° F) breaks natural dormancy (2). The best seedbed is a moist, rich, loamy soil with a protective cover of leaves and litter. Germination is hypogeal. Sassafras is intolerant of shade and reproduction is sparse and erratic in wooded areas. Subsequent reproduction is usually vegetative. The dense thickets often found in woods openings or in old fields develop from root sprouts rather than seed. On good sites where competition is not heavy, the sprouts may grow 3.7 in (12 ft) in 3 years and sometimes are abundant (3). Elsewhere growth is slow. Because sassafras grows in dense stands and sprouts prolifically, it is a difficult cover type to convert to pine or more desirable hardwoods. Vegetative Reproduction- Sassafras reproduces easily by root sprouts. In parts of its ranges, sprouts rapidly restock abandoned farmlands (3). Sprouting is prolific from the stumps of young trees. Sassafras can be propagated fairly well from root cuttings, but not from stem cuttings. Two cutting types-roots with a stem sprout planted vertically and large roots planted horizontally-were found to be superior (9).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Sassafras varies in size from shrubs to large trees with straight, clear trunks. The short, stout branches spread at right angles to form a narrow flat-topped crown. It may attain heights of 30 in (98 ft) on the best sites. On poor sites, especially in the northern part of its range and in Florida, sassafras is short and shrubby (12). Mature trees may average only 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) in d.b.h., with a maximum of about 38 cm (15 in). Natural pruning is good in well-stocked stands. Rooting Habit- Sassafras roots are shallow and of the prominent lateral type. The long laterals extend for a distance with little change in diameter, branch occasionally, and form an increasingly complex system (3). The laterals are practically all from 15 to 50 cm (6 to 20 in) deep, rising and falling at various intervals. Lateral spread is at the rate of 74 cm (29 in) per year. The forming of a sucker results in the development of feeding roots that otherwise would not be present on the lateral. These roots arise near the sucker and on the larger part of the lateral. They branch to very fine rootlets that are quite important in the species adaptability to vigorous growth on various types of soil. Reaction to Competition- Sassafras is classed as intolerant of shade at all ages. In forest stands, it usually appears as individual trees or in small groups and is usually in the dominant overstory. In the understory along the edges of heavy stands it may live, but generally does not reach merchantable size. If it becomes overtopped in mixed stands, it is one of the first species to die. Allelopathy seems to be the mechanism that allows sassafras, when it has invaded abandoned fields, to maintain itself aggressively in a relatively pure and mature forest (4). Field studies revealed that 10 species consistently appear exclusively outside of clump canopies of sassafras, and 7 other species predominated beneath the sassafras canopy. Annual herbs were effectively excluded from the understory flora. The allelopaths produced by sassafras are believed to be 2-pinene, 3-phellandrene, eugenol, safrole, citrol, and s-camphor (4). Damaging Agents- Sassafras is highly susceptible to fire damage at any age. Light fires kill reproduction and small saplings, and heavier burns injure large trees and provide entry for pathogens. Sassafras may die if not well protected from extremes of winter weather. Foliage diseases are primarily the main damaging agents to sassafras. Actinopelte dryina is largely a southern fungus severely blighting the leaves. Mycosphaerella sassafras is one of the most widely occurring leaf spots of sassafras. A Nectria canker on trunks is fairly common in the southern Appalachian region. Remarkably, few reports of wood-rot fungi on sassafras have appeared in the literature (6). Mistletoe (Phoradendron flavescens) has been reported (8). At least 15 species of insects attack sassafras, including root borers, leaf feeders, and sucking insects. Except for small local outbreaks, damage is relatively unimportant. From New York to Florida, the larvae of a wood-boring weevil (Apteromechus ferratus) kills trees up to 25 cm (10 in) in diameter. Two leaf feeders, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and looper (Epimecis hortaria), are found on sassafras in the Northeastern United States and in the Atlantic States, respectively. Sassafras is probably one of the favorite forest tree foods of the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) (8).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,14,0
"Sassafras can be found on virtually all soil types within its range. It grows best in open woods on moist, well-drained, sandy loam soils, but is a pioneer species on abandoned fields, along fence rows, and on dry ridges and upper slopes, especially following fire. In the South Atlantic and Gulf Coast States where sites are predominately sandy soils, mature sassafras seldom exceeds sapling size. On the Lake Michigan dunes of Indiana, it grows on pure, shifting sand (5). It is also found on poor gravelly soils and clay loams. Sassafras is most commonly found growing on soils of the orders Entisols, Alfisols, and Ultisols. Optimum soil pH is 6.0 to 7.0 (14). The species is found at elevations varying from welldrained Mississippi River bottom lands and loessial bluffs to 1220 m (4,000 ft) in the southern Appalachian Mountains (10,11).",Soils and Topography,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,15,0
"The bark, twigs, and leaves of sassafras are important foods for wildlife in some areas. Deer browse the twigs in the winter and the leaves and succulent growth during spring and summer. Palatability, although quite variable, is considered good throughout the range. In addition to its value to wildlife, sassafras provides wood and bark for a variety of commercial and domestic uses. Tea is brewed from the bark of roots. The leaves are used in thickening soups. The orange wood has been used for cooperage, buckets, posts, and furniture (7). The oil is used to perfume some soaps. Finally, sassafras is considered a good choice for restoring depleted soils in old fields. It was superior to black locust or pines for this purpose in Indiana and Illinois (1).",Special Uses,Sassafras,sassafras,albidum,hardwood,16,0
"Scarlet oak is recognized as an important component of 14 forest cover types in North America (8). It is a major component of two variants of Chestnut Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 44).

Seed Production and Dissemination- Minimum seed-bearing age is 20 years, but maximum production does not occur until after 50 years of age. Seed production increases with tree size up to a diameter of 51 cm (20 in), then levels off. On the average, good seed crops occur every 3 to 5 years, although actual seed production may be irregular and unpredictable from year to year. In Missouri, scarlet oak acorn crops tend to be more variable than those of black oak (Quercus uelutina), white oak (Q. alba), post oak (Q. stellata), and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica) (4,5). Maximum annual production of mature scarlet oak acorns in Missouri for a 4-year period was about 25 acorns per square meter (2 or 3/ft²) of crown area (18). In contrast, maximum annual production of black oak and white oak acorns was 70 to 75/m² (about 7/ft²)during the same period. In the Southeast, scarlet oak acorn production has averaged 14.6 kg/m² (3.0 lb/ft²) of basal area of scarlet red oak trees for a 12-year period (2). This production rate was about 25 percent of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and about 36 percent of white oak during the same period; however, scarlet oak acorn production exceeded that of black oak and chestnut oak (Q. prinus). More than 80 percent of mature scarlet oak acorns may be destroyed by insects. Most insect damage occurs after acorn fall. The most important insect pests are nut weevils (Curculio spp.), moth larvae (Lepidoptera), and cynipid gall wasps (Cynipidae) (18). The proportion of uninfested acorns is usually highest in years of greatest seed production. Scarlet oak acorns are a choice food for eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, mice, wild turkey, deer, and birds, especially blue jays and red-headed woodpeckers (4). One-third to one-half of acorn losses have been attributed to removal by birds and squirrels while the acorns were still on the tree. Seedling Development- A light covering of forest litter is beneficial to the germination of scarlet oak acorns; no litter or a deep litter is less favorable. A moderately open overstory canopy provides a more favorable environment for acorn germination than does a completely closed or very open canopy (4). Germination is hypogeal. Shoots of scarlet oak seedlings commonly die back and resprout, thus forming seedling sprouts; resprouting occurs from dormant buds at or above the root collar. As a result of recurrent shoot dieback, root systems of scarlet oaks may be many years older than shoots. The potential rate of annual height growth of this reproduction increases with increasing basal diameter of sprouts (23). Young stump sprouts may produce up to three flushes of shoot growth per growing season (6). However, individual flush lengths get progressively shorter as the season progresses. Despite the initial rapid height growth of scarlet oak stump sprouts, a comparison of site index curves for sprouts with conventional curves indicated that the height growth of sprouts falls off rapidly after 20 years (26). A two-cut shelterwood method has been recommended to regenerate scarlet oaks with the first cut made to provide a favorable germination environment (4). The second cut is made to release the advanced regeneration as soon as sufficient numbers of stems are large enough to successfully compete with the other vegetation that will develop when the remaining overstory is removed (24). Vegetative Reproduction- Scarlet oak stumps produce sprouts at greater ages and larger sizes than most other oaks (4). They also produce a larger number of sprouts per stump and these sprouts grow faster than those of most associated oaks, hickories (Carya spp.), and red maple (Acer rubrum) during the first 5 years (25). However, the percent of stumps that sprout decreases from near 100 percent for trees 10 cm (4 in) d.b.h. and smaller to about 18 percent for trees 61 cm (24 in) d.b.h. (11). In a study of scarlet oak sprouts in the Appalachians, 28 percent had butt rot, and sprouts from large stumps were more subject to butt rot than sprouts from small stumps (22). As the sprouts grow older, the rot spreads and may weaken the trees to a point where they break off during high winds. Because of poor natural pruning, only one-third of scarlet oak crop trees originating from sprouts produce stems with desirable bole quality, even on good sites, i.e., oak site index 23 in (75 ft) (27). However, in coppice stands, thinning sprout clumps to one stem can increase growth and survival of the remaining stem (14).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Scarlet Oak,quercus,coccinea,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Scarlet oak is a medium-sized tree, normally maturing when 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) tall and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) d.b.h. Maximum size is about 30 m (100 ft) in height and 122 cm (48 in) in d.b.h. The tree grows rapidly and matures early. Economic maturity is reached at 46 to 58 cm (18 to 23 in) d.b.h., depending on vigor class (4). In diameter growth, scarlet oak ranks ahead or equal to that of associated oaks. Among 11 species compared in pole-size stands in the Central States, average 10-year diameter growth for scarlet oaks was exceeded only by yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black walnut (Juglans nigra) (9). However, on poor sites, scarlet oak probably grows more rapidly than any of its associates (4). Yields of fully stocked unthinned oak stands in which scarlet oak is present range at age 80 from about 75.6 m³/ha (5,400 fbm/acre) for site index 55 to 175.0 m³/ha (12,500 fbm/acre) for site index 75 (10). Thinning scarlet oak stands can greatly increase growth and quality of individual trees (7,12). Rooting Habit- Scarlet oak seedlings develop a strong taproot with relatively few lateral roots. Difficulties in transplanting this species may be related to its coarse root system plus its relatively slow rate of root regeneration (16). Reaction to Competition- Scarlet oak is classed as very intolerant of shade. Except for reproduction under older stands, it is usually found only as a dominant or codominant (4). Its absence in suppressed or intermediate positions is indicative of its intolerance. It probably maintains its dominance on dry sites because of its rapid growth and drought tolerance, and because of light conditions that are adequate for the establishment and development of reproduction (4,21). When site index is equal, scarlet oak tends to be better represented in forests with a fire history than in forests with little or no evidence of past burning (3). Its better representation on burned sites may be related to its vigorous sprouting ability after burning, together with the elimination of more fire-sensitive competitors. Damaging Agents- Because of its thin bark, scarlet oak is very susceptible to fire damage. If not killed outright, the tree is usually injured so that sap or heart rots enter (4). This weakness, coupled with a dry environment, helps explain the high mortality or severe damage to trees even from light ground fires. Nevertheless, basal sprouting from fire-killed scarlet oaks may be prolific. Heart rots of scarlet oak can enter the bole through branch stubs even at an early age and cause severe damage. Heart rots are especially common in stump sprouts that originate high on the stump (4). In one study, decay in scarlet oak sprouts that originated at or below ground line was only 9 percent, whereas decay in sprouts originating 2.5 cm (I in) or more above ground was 44 percent (22). The fungus Stereum gausapatum, which is transmitted from stump to sprout, was the most common cause of decay. Scarlet oak is also susceptible to oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum). Trees attacked by this fungus may die within a month after the first symptoms appear. This oak is also subject to cankers of Nectria spp. and Strummella coryneoidea. These diseases are especially severe from Virginia northward (4). The major insect defoliators in scarlet oak include the oak leafteater (Croesia semipurpurana), fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), and orangestriped oakworm. (Anisota senatoria) (19). Coupled with defoliation by spring frosts, repeated defoliation by these insects either individually or in combination is thought to be the primary cause of ""decline"" and mortality of scarlet oak and other oaks in the red oak group in Pennsylvania. Similarly, in the Missouri Ozarks, scarlet oak decline has been linked to a complex of factors including insects, disease, drought, and soil-site relations (13). The walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata) may severely defoliate scarlet oak, particularly in the northern portion of the scarlet oak range. The twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus) is a secondary pest of scarlet and other oaks following drought, fire, frost damage, or defoliation by other insects. Larvae of carpenterworms (Prionoxystus sp.) can damage scarlet oak by tunneling into heartwood and sapwood. They prefer open grown trees or trees growing on poor sites. Ambrosia beetles (Platypus sp. and Xyleborus sp.) and the oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus) can invade and damage freshly cut or wounded trees (4). The red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus) breeds in trunks of living trees greater than 5 cm (2 in) d.b.h. Larvae bore into phloem and cause serious defect and degrade; ants and fungi may then enter wounds and cause further injury (1). The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) sometimes nests in standing trees. Ants may enter the tree through stem cracks, scars, and holes and may extend their galleries into sound wood (1). The gouty oak gall wasp (Callirhytis quercuepunctata) can produce galls on twigs and smaller limbs of scarlet oak, and heavy infestations may kill the entire tree. Also, the large oak-apple gall wasp (Amphibolips confluenta) may cause gall on the leaves or leaf petioles of scarlet oak (1).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Scarlet Oak,quercus,coccinea,hardwood,14,0
"Scarlet oak is found on a wide variety of soils. The soil groups with which it is most frequently associated in the northern portion of its range include Fragiudalfs, Hapludalfs, and Paleudalfs of the order Alfisols (much of these formerly classified as gray-brown podzolic soils). In the northeastern portion of the species range, the predominant soil group is the Dystrochrept of the order Inceptisols (which includes soils formerly classified as brown podzolic). In the south, the species range lies within the area of soil groups that include Fragiudults, Hapludults, and Paleudults of the order Ultisols (much of these formerly classified as red-yellow podzolic soils). The site index of scarlet oak at base age 50 years ranges from 11.3 to 27.7 in (37 to 91 ft) in the Missouri Ozarks (4,15). In the southern Appalachians, it regenerates and competes best on middle to upper slopes of southern exposure (17). However, site index increases with increasing depth of the A horizon, decreasing amounts of sand in the A horizon, and lower position on the slope. In the northern Appalachians, position on the slope, slope gradient, aspect, and soil depth to bedrock are also important site factors (4). Although its successional position has not been defined, scarlet oak is probably a climax tree on dry soils. Because of its hardiness, it can be planted on a wide variety of soils. Maximum elevation for scarlet oak is about 1520 in (5,000 ft) in the southern Appalachians; it is common at elevations less than 910 in (3,000 ft).",Soils and Topography,Scarlet Oak,quercus,coccinea,hardwood,15,0
"In addition to its value as a timber and wildlife species, scarlet oak is widely planted as an ornamental. Its brilliant red autumn color, open crown texture, and rapid growth make it a desirable tree for yard, street, and park.",Special Uses,Scarlet Oak,quercus,coccinea,hardwood,16,0
"Scotch pine has been naturalized in northern New York. The associated trees are black cherry (Prunus serotina), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).",Associated Forest Cover,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,1,1
"Scotch pine is adapted to a wide variety of climates as indicated by its extremely large natural range. It grows in areas with an annual precipitation exceeding 1780 mm (70 in) and in areas with an annual precipitation as little as 200 mm (8 in). Scotch pine survives in the Verkhoyansk Mountains of eastern Siberia where winter temperatures have been recorded as low as -64° C (-83° F). In some areas it grows where the subsoil is permanently frozen. Scotch pine can also survive high temperatures, and it is found at middle altitudes in the Mediterranean region. The primary distribution of Scotch pine, however, indicates that it is a tree of the continental climates (18).",Climate,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,2,1
"Hybrids between recognized varieties can be made but are not common. In the Michigan seed source study, one seed source from northern France was evidently a hybrid because it produced trees with characteristics intermediate between varieties haguenensis and aquitana (28). Scotch pine can be hybridized with Japanese red pine (P. densiflora) and Austrian pine (P. nigra).",Hybrids,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,9,1
"Scotch pine has been widely planted in the United States, especially in the Northeast, Lake States, Central States, and Pacific Northwest. It is now considered naturalized in parts of New England and the Lake States (29). The species has also been planted across southern Canada. Scotch pine is the most widely distributed pine in the world. It grows naturally from Scotland almost to the Pacific Ocean and from above the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. Its altitudinal range is from sea level to about 2440 m (8,000 ft).",Native Range,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,11,1
"Scotch pine, like many of the hard pines, is intolerant of shade. Seedlings germinating under a dense forest canopy do not survive for long. Although the seedlings will grow very well on fertile soil, they are usually found on the more sandy dry soils because of the lack of competition from other trees and plants. During the last century, Scottish foresters have had serious difficulties establishing Scotch pine regeneration under mature pine stands. This difficulty appears to be partly due to grazing by deer and domestic animals. Successful regeneration has been achieved, however, with the uniform or shelterwood compartment system, which also appears to be successful in the Scandinavian countries (18). The best regeneration is found in stands with the following characteristics: large seed supply, open or light tree canopy, light understory ground cover, and exposed mineral soil or no continuous layer of raw humus (18). In the United States in the Northeastern and Lake States, Scotch pine reproduction is extremely abundant on the more sandy sites. As soon as the parent stand reaches seed bearing age, it begins to spread outward into firebreaks and along open roadsides. In many areas reproduction is so plentiful as to present a mat of seedlings, and this aggressive reproductive habit has concerned foresters who preferred to grow other conifer species on these sites. A recent event in New York may change this reproductive potential of Scotch pine. When scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina) is present in the Scotch pine overstory, the advance reproduction can be completely eliminated (15). As this disease has advanced across northern New York, the ""mats"" of Scotch pine reproduction have become seas of dead seedlings. New seedlings continue to germinate under the parent stand but become infected and die within 1 or 2 years. Scleroderris canker is present in Scotland but it is not known whether this disease is related to the reproduction problems there. Flowering and Fruiting- Although Scotch pine is primarily a monoecious species, some shoots, branches, and even entire trees are predominantly of one sex. Male flower primordia are formed in late summer at the base of the bud that will make the next year's growth. During the winter their presence can be noted as a slight swelling, and the preferred male catkins are easily visible if a bud is dissected. About 2 weeks after growth begins in the spring, the male catkins enlarge to 0.6 to 0.7 cm. (0.2 to 0.3 in) long and shed pollen. At this time they are yellow. The male catkins are borne at the base of the twigs, replacing leaf clusters. They are most common in the lower part of the crown and on short lateral twigs. Because they replace leaves, an excess of pollen production can lead to sparse foliage. A Pennsylvania breeder who selected for early flower production for two generations obtained a variety that produced plentiful pollen but few needles and it was worthless as a Christmas tree. Female flower primordia are also formed in late summer but are microscopic. They are borne at the tips of buds for the next year's growth. There may be one, two, or three on a single bud. They first become visible after the buds expand in the spring. The primordia enlarge into female flowers or strobili about 2 weeks after growth begins in the spring, at a time when the new growth has completed 75 percent of its elongation for the season. Because of this, shearing of the outside branches such as is practiced by Christmas tree growers removes all female flowers. Indeed, trees sheared in June will not produce seed for the next 3.5 years. Flowering occurs in late May or early June. On any one tree nearly all pollen is shed and nearly all the female flowers are receptive during the same 2- or 3-day period. In any one stand most trees flower within a day or two of each other. Trees of different provenances may differ in blooming time by several days, however; trees of northern provenances bloom the earliest. Pollen production tends to be concentrated on short lateral twigs in the lower half of a tree crown. Female flowers are borne on the most vigorous shoots. They tend to be concentrated on upper branches but may occur in any part of the crown receiving full sunlight. Pollination occurs in early summer, at a time when the female strobili are from 0.6 to 0.7 cm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long. Shortly after pollination, the scales of the female strobili thicken, and the pollen grains germinate and send out a short pollen tube. At this time the female strobili become reflexed instead of pointing forward. For the next 12 months the germinated pollen remains dormant and the female strobili grow little. A little more than a year after pollination, the germinated pollen grains renew growth and fertilize the ovules. In June, soon after fertilization, the conelets rapidly elongate and reach full size by early summer. Seeds mature and cones ripen in early October. The cones require alternating periods of dry and wet weather to open and shed few seed until early winter. Indeed, many seeds are retained on the tree until early spring. Seeds from any one tree can be sorted visually by color into those that are full and those that are empty-empty seeds are much lighter in color (often nearly white) than full ones. On any one tree the full seeds are fairly uniform in color and size, but both traits vary considerably from tree to tree. Trees from the same stand may produce seeds ranging from tan to almost black and from all one color to speckled. Seed size varies in a geographic pattern-seeds from the extreme northern latitudes are half the size of those from the southern part of the range. Seed Production and Dissemination- Individual trees in Michigan, under favorable growth conditions, begin to produce male and female flowers at from 5 to 8 years, although the average is between 10 and 15 years (26). Scotch pine continues to produce viable seeds until at least age 200, although seed quality and size are greatly reduced at this age (18). Good seed crops are produced at intervals of from 3 to 6 years with light crops in most intervening years. The number of cleaned seeds per kilogram ranges from 74,500 to 244,700 (33,800 to 111,000/lb). If properly stored, the seeds remain viable for 15 years. One kilogram (2.2 lb) of average size cones produces approximately 3,300 seeds (21). Scotch pine cones begin to open in late October, and seed dispersal continues into December. At times, large quantities of seed are dispersed onto snow cover. Seed dispersal for natural restocking of cutover areas is normally limited to between 50 and 100 in (164 to 328 ft) from the parent tree. Maximum seed dispersal is much greater, however. In northern New York, the establishment of second-generation natural Scotch pine seedlings up to at least 1 km (0.6 mi) from the seed source is the rule rather than the exception (29). Seed crops in New York and Nebraska have been damaged primarily by coneworm larvae (Dioryctria spp.). Tip moths (Rhyacionia spp.), which destroy shoots bearing newly formed or developing conelets, are common in Scotch pine seed orchards. Seedling Development- Seeds tested in the laboratory differ in their degree of dormancy according to geographical seed source, individual tree selection, and seed maturity. Most, however, will germinate immediately if placed in warm, moist conditions. Germination is epigeal (21). Artificial light has been shown to increase germination by 83 percent for some seed sources (4). Field germination is best under full or partial sunlight. Seedling establishment is best when adequate moisture is available and some shade is present. In northern New York, Scotch pine has established itself rapidly on abandoned old fields on very light soils. At present, almost all the Scotch pine plantations in North America are from planted nursery stock. Two-year-old stock averages from 8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) in height. Early nursery practice was to grow the seedlings very close together-from 2,150 to 3,230/m² (200 to 300/ft²) of seedbed. The result was a tall, spindly seedling that bent to the ground when subjected to wet snow during the first winter. These young trees developed a crook at the base. As they developed, the growing tip overcompensated for this crook resulting in an S-shaped stem. The trees eventually returned to a vertical growth habit, but the crook remained. When nursery stock is grown at lower density, 540 seedlings per square meter (50/ft²), the resulting stock is sturdier and is able to resist snow bending during its early years. The idea that certain varieties (especially Riga) are always straight wherever grown and that other varieties (such as German and Belgian) are generally crooked is too simple and not always true. Form is as much a matter of site as of variety. On some sites most trees grow crooked whereas on other sites trees of any variety are usually straight. Scotch pine inherently grows straight unless the leader is damaged, when it is apt to be very crooked. The tendency for a variety to be straight or crooked depends on its susceptibility to a particular pest or other damaging agent, and on the presence of that pest or damaging agent in that locality. For example, when the Zimmerman moth (Dioryctria zimmermani) is present in high numbers, Greek trees, which are generally not attacked, are straight, while Belgian trees, which are very susceptible, are very crooked. Where pine grosbeaks are present in large numbers, the Belgian trees, which are resistant to this pest, are straight whereas trees of the Riga variety are likely to be crooked. Poor quality sites seem to have a larger number of pests and a larger number of poorly formed trees than good quality sites. Scotch pine produces one whorl of branches per year. A fast-growing tree may have branches 0.8 m (2-5 ft) apart resulting in a thin crown. To promote closer branching and denser crowns for Christmas tree production, the trees are sheared by removing the tips of all the new shoots. Following shearing, the leaf fascicles near the cut ends develop adventitious buds. These buds are not formed if shearing is done during late summer. Scotch pine seedlings grow rapidly in their early years. In Nebraska, after 8 field seasons, trees ranged in height from 2.5 to 5.0 m (8.2 to 16.4 ft) depending on the seed source. Trees from central European seed grew fastest while those from Scandinavian and Siberian origins grew slowest (10). On good sites throughout the Lake States and the Northeast, trees of the fast-growing varieties can grow 0.8 m (2.5 ft) per year. In Michigan shoot growth begins in early May in the central part of the State and in mid-May in the Upper Peninsula. The new shoots elongate rapidly and achieve 90 percent of their growth within 3 weeks. Insects have not been a serious problem under nursery conditions, although a pine shoot moth (Rhyacionia adana) has injured some new Scotch pine shoots in several Michigan nurseries (22). The most serious nursery problem of Scotch pine seedlings is Lophodermium needlecast, usually attributed to L. pinastri but now assigned to L. seditiosum. This disease has killed or seriously damaged millions of Scotch pine seedlings in at least 40 tree nurseries in the Northeast, Lake States, Pacific Northwest, and Canada. Nursery stock infected with Lophodermium has also been shipped from nurseries to outplanting sites where further damage has occurred in the young plantations (8). Vegetative Reproduction- In nature, Scotch pine does not reproduce vegetatively. It is not difficult, however, to graft scions from the larger trees onto potted understock of Scotch pine. In a Swedish study, cuttings from young seedlings (50 to 100 days old) rooted readily, but cuttings from shoots of 3-year-old plants rooted poorly (19).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Scotch pine shows tremendous variation in yield, both by site and by geographic seed source. In seed source tests, some varieties grew 2.5 times as fast as others on the same site (28). The average height of 150-year-old trees in Scotland is from 13.7 to 16.8 m (45 to 55 ft). On well-drained sites, an occasional tree as tall as 22.9 m (75 ft) is found (18). In a Michigan study in which dominant crop trees were released, the released trees averaged 13.7 m (45 ft) in height and 18 cm (6.9 in) in d.b.h. at 21 years. The plantation was grown from seed from Magdeburg, Germany, and the soil is a fox sandy loam on a well-drained site (13). A 32-year-old, unthinned Scotch pine plantation in the same area averaged 19 cm (7.3 in) in d.b.h. and 18.6 m (61 ft) in height. This seed source was probably central Europe. A Scotch pine plantation in northern New York averaged 26.0 m (85.5 ft) tall and 48 cm (19 in) d.b.h. at age 74 to 77 years. The largest tree in this stand was 29.0 m (95.25 ft) tall and 51 cm (20.2 in) in d.b.h. One of the earliest Scotch pine plantations in the United States was planted in 1879 near Boonville, NY. The seed source was probably southern Germany (9). Although no stand data are available, the largest tree still standing in 1981 was 26.8 m (88 ft) tall and 66 cm (26 in) in d.b.h. Thinning a Scotch pine plantation in southern Michigan increased diameter growth but reduced total volume production (12). At 42 years the unthinned portion of the stand averaged 23 cm (9.2 in) in d.b.h. and contained a volume of 263.8 m³/ha (3,768 ft/acre). Basal area was 36.0 m²/ha (157 ft²/acre). The area receiving five light thinnings at 5-year intervals to a basal area of 19.5 to 21.8 m²/ha (85 to 95 ft²/acre) had an average d.b.h. of 30 cm (11.8 in) but volume was only 155.2 m³/ha (2,217 ft³/acre) and basal area was 25.7 m²/ha (112 ft²/acre). The heaviest thinning with five thinnings at 5-year intervals to a basal area of 14.9 to 17.2 m²/ha (65 to 75 ft²/acre) produced an average d.b.h. of 34 cm (13.3 in) with 117.5 m³/ha (1,679 ft³/acre) of volume and 20.7 m²/ha (90 ft²/acre) of basal area. Rooting Habit- Scotch pine frequently, but not always, develops a taproot. One study in Europe found 64 percent of the trees with taproots. Often, the lateral roots turn and grow down vertically, acting as a taproot. Taproots are more common on sandy soils than on moraine or gravel soils. The average depth of taproots is from 1.5 to 3.0 m (4.9 to 9.8 ft). The bulk of the root system consists of horizontal roots close to the surface. The majority of these horizontal roots are within 20 cm (7.8 in) of the surface. The horizontal root system is smaller on good soils than on poor soils. The depth of the horizontal root system is also related to soil moisture-it is deeper on the drier soils. On vigorous trees, the length of the longest horizontal roots ranged from 4.5 m (14.8 ft) for 14-year-old trees to 17.1 m (56.0 ft) for 52-year-old trees. Root systems on rocky soils are usually shorter than on sandy soils. The size of the stem and the length of horizontal roots are closely interdependent. A small tree will have a small root system regardless of the tree age, and the root system of a large Scotch pine may cover an area of 0.125 ha (0.3 acre) (5). Reaction to Competition- Scotch pine, like red pine, is intolerant of shade. Overtopped saplings eventually are lost to suppression. Where Scotch pine has been intermixed with red or white pine at planting, the Scotch pine grows so much more aggressively during the first few years that its roots crowd out roots of the other species leaving only Scotch pine. Many open-grown trees in poorly stocked stands are bushy and crooked with large-diameter branches. This habit appears to be due more to stand stocking than to genetic factors. Much of the experience with Scotch pine in the United States has been in Christmas tree plantations. In these stands, the trees are usually planted at a spacing of 2 by 2 m (6.6 by 6.6 ft) and are harvested within 8 to 15 years. Early growth in these plantations can be doubled by removing grass and weed competition either by mowing or by using chemical herbicides. In Norway and Sweden, Scotch pine is normally managed under a uniform or shelterwood system, in compartments of about 4 ha (10 acres). The regeneration cut is made to coincide with a heavy seed year. This can be predicted 1 year in advance because the cones take 2 years to mature. At the time of regeneration, the number of overstory trees is reduced to approximately 50/ha (20/acre) by one or two fellings to provide the required light conditions for young seedlings and to reduce root competition for water and nutrients. The seed trees normally are felled when the reproduction is well established- usually within 5 to 10 years (18). Damaging Agents- Scotch pine in North America is subject to a number of agents that can severely damage or kill the trees. Some of these agents are not present in Europe and Asia and, as a result, the species has not yet had an opportunity to develop genetic resistance. Fire and wind can damage the trees. Young stands have thin bark and are heavily damaged by fire. Older trees with thicker bark are moderately resistant. Scotch pine has more branches per whorl than red or white pine and this large number of branches makes the tree weak at the nodes. During severe wind storms, trees may snap off at the nodes 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft) above the ground. Wildlife and insects are also damaging. The pine grosbeak feeds on the terminal and lateral buds of Scotch pine causing numerous small crooks. Trees of Scandinavian provenances are heavily attacked. In Christmas tree plantations, this feeding can cause major economic losses; a single year's feeding can reduce the tree harvest by 50 percent. This is a minor problem to timber growers, however (2). On occasion, porcupine seriously damage Scotch pine plantations by girdling young trees, causing dead tops. The pine root collar weevil (Hylobius radicis) is a major cause of tree death in young plantations in the Lake States. The weevil girdles the tree at the base, killing it within 3 to 4 years. The damage is especially severe on dry sandy soils. The fast-growing central European trees are particularly susceptible (26). In Michigan, on low quality sites, mortality frequently reaches 70 to 80 percent. The pine root tip weevil (Hylobius rhizophagus) causes serious damage in Michigan on Scotch pine Christmas trees grown from stump culture. These trees result from leaving the lower limbs on cut trees to grow into a second tree crop. The pine root tip weevil larvae feed on the roots and root tips, resulting in reduced height growth and flagged shoots, and eventual death. In some cases the pine root tip weevil and the pine root collar weevil attack some Scotch pine stands simultaneously, causing more mortality than expected from either insect alone (7). The European pine sawfly (Neodiprion sertifer) causes moderate damage in Christmas trees and ornamental plantings. Heavy defoliation reduces growth from 10 to 20 percent. The fast-growing Scotch pine variety uralensis shows some resistance to this insect while the slow-growing variety iberica is most susceptible (27). If Scotch pine is pruned in midsummer, the Zimmerman pine moth may be attracted to the fresh pitch. The larvae feed in the cambial region, causing masses of coagulated pitch and frass to collect. Feeding by several larvae at the same whorl may kill the tree top or the entire tree. Partially girdled stems frequently break at the weakened area during storms (28). The white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi) burrows into terminal shoots and kills them. This insect is very damaging to trees on light soils but causes only minor damage on better sites (28). The eastern pine shoot borer (Eucosma gloriola) also burrows in the pith of new growth. In Michigan plantations, this insect is universal but causes only minor damage. The pine spittlebug (Aphrophora parallela) is a serious pest in many Scotch pine Christmas tree plantations. Heavy infestations of spittlebugs may cause twig, branch, and tree mortality. In one 19-year-old Scotch pine plantation in southern Michigan, the pine spittlebug has apparently acted as the vector for the fungus disease Sphaeropsis sapinea; mortality is now 25 percent and is continuing. Lophodermium needlecast caused by the fungus Lophodermium seditiosum is the most serious disease of Scotch pine Christmas tree plantations. The major loss is due to premature defoliation resulting in unsalable Christmas trees. In general, the longer needle provenances are resistant to this disease. The problem is minor in forest stands (8). Scotch pine is also a host for brown spot needle disease of southern pines (Scirrhia acicola). This disease, like Lophodermium, causes premature defoliation and is primarily limited to Christmas tree plantations. The long needle provenances are also more resistant to this disease (16). Western gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii) is common on Scotch pine in the Lake States and the Northeast. Individual trees may have several hundred galls. In most cases damage is limited to branch mortality and growth loss. As described earlier, Scotch pine is susceptible to scleroderris canker. This disease is present in many areas in Europe, and as a result, certain Scotch pine provenances show some resistance. Scotch pine is more resistant to scleroderris canker than red pine, and in some areas, red pines have been eliminated from the stand while Scotch pines are still alive. Scleroderris canker can be spread on cut Scotch pine Christmas trees. Therefore, State quarantines have been established to prevent the movement of this disease into noninfected areas (15). When southern seed sources of Scotch pine are planted too far north of their normal range, severe foliage winter injury develops. This winter injury causes both branch and tree mortality. In the Lake States, a large number of Christmas tree plantations have been destroyed by this problem. Many of these problems in Scotch pine plantations are the result of planting this species on very poor sites or planting the wrong seed source. Scotch pine has the inherent ability to produce excellent, straight-boled stands under the proper conditions. Hundreds of Scotch pine plantations throughout the Lake States and the Northeast are equal to or better than the best red pine stands. When Scotch pine is planted on very poor sites, however, or when improper seed sources are used, damage by insects is so severe as to make the final stand useless for timber production.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,14,1
"In Europe, Scotch pine grows on a wide variety of soil types. In Scotland it is found on the most ancient rocks and also on the most recent glacial deposits. The cool, humid climate of Scotland, along with the nature of the parent material, which is usually siliceous and acidic, frequently results in a deep litter and raw humus layer. The soils exhibit various degrees of podzolization. Scotch pine grows well on these soils but best growth is on freely drained sands and gravels, often on knolls and terraces. These soils have only a thin layer of raw humus and are weakly podzolized. Although Scotch pine grows on peat land in certain areas, usually it is badly stunted (18). Studies of the mineral nutrient content of the foliage of several Scotch pine provenances at three sites in Michigan show that Scotch pine has evolved an efficient mechanism to extract nutrients from the infertile sites to which it is relegated in its native range. Significant differences were found among seed sources in their ability to accumulate nitrogen, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, and boron. Magnesium was one of the key minerals in Scotch pine nutrition at all three sites. The faster-growing seed sources accumulated higher levels of foliar magnesium (17). Although Scotch pine can grow on soils with pH from 4.0 to 7.0, it grows best on soils in the 4.5 to 6.0 range (1). In the Lake States, Scotch pine is planted most commonly on level or gently rolling sand plains-chiefly at elevations between 300 m (1,000 ft) and 460 m (1,500 ft). In the Eastern States, it has been planted not only on outwash plains, but also on mountain slopes at elevations from a few meters above sea level to about 820 m (2,700 ft) in the Adirondacks. Scotch pine grows well on the loess soils of northern Idaho and eastern Washington, under rainfall conditions prevailing in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) zone. Scotch pine grows most commonly on soils in the orders Spodosols, Entisols, Inceptisols, Histosols, Alfisols, and Mollisols.",Soils and Topography,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,15,1
"Scotch pine is the most widely planted pine introduced in North America. It is also the preferred large-volume Christmas tree in the United States- approximately 30 percent of the 35 million Christmas trees harvested annually are Scotch pine (20). Because it survives on poor droughty sites, Scotch pine has been used to control erosion in many areas. However, the poor vigor of many of these stands on dry, infertile sites has made them susceptible to serious insect attack and many of them have little potential to produce timber (28). Scotch pine has also been used to a large extent in ornamental plantings. It grows better than red pine on compacted clay soils frequently found around homesites. Because Christmas tree plantations are a ready source of trees, many trees are removed from these plantations as ornamental stock. Many Scotch pine have also been planted along roadsides throughout the Lake States. Scotch pine is similar in fiber and wood characteristics to red pine and is usable for both pulpwood and saw logs.",Special Uses,Scotch Pine,pinus,sylvestris,conifer,16,1
"September elm is generally very scattered, and there are few records of stands with this species as a primary component. It is not a common associate in any of the forest cover types currently listed by the Society of American Foresters. September elm often grows on floodplains in mid-to late-successional communities where common associates are American elm (Ulmus americana), river birch (Betula nigra), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and sometimes silver maple (Acer saccharinum). In coves and on mesic slopes it may grow with American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), Florida maple (Acer barbatum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), blue ash (F. quadrangulata), sweetgum, northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Q. alba), and American elm. Its common appearance on strearnsides, roadsides, and other openings may indicate low shade tolerance (13).",Associated Forest Cover,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,1,0
"The distribution of September elm is in the humid to temperate zones of the East-Central United States. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 1020 mm (40 in) to about 1320 mm (52 in), of which about 50 to 65 percent occurs from April through September. Average annual snowfall over the region ranges from about 5 cm (2 in) to 50 cm (20 in). Average annual temperatures range between 13° C (55° F) and 17° C (62° F), but the lowest and highest temperatures observed are -23° C (-10° F) and 46° C (115° F), respectively. The growing season averages between 180 and 220 days over the species range (15).",Climate,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,2,0
"Little information is available on genetic characteristics of September elm. Santamour (7) reported that the chromosome number of September elm was diploid (2n=28) and he later (8) used this characteristic to advantage in making crosses of Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia) and September elm with nine spring flowering species. Fourteen hybrids were developed from these interspecific crossings, four of which were from U. serotina. Later crosses of September elm with Siberian elm (U. pumila) showed that the hybrids were very susceptible to Dutch elm disease (9).",Genetics,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,7,0
"September elm grows sporadically from southern Illinois across Kentucky and Tennessee to northern Georgia, northern Alabama, northern Mississippi, Arkansas, and eastern Oklahoma (5). It is most abundant in Arkansas and Tennessee. -The native range of September elm.",Native Range,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- September elm and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) are the two species of native elms that flower and bear fruit in the fall. The hermaphroditic, protogynous flowers of September elm usually appear in September and are in small racemes in the leaf axils of the current season (2). The fruit are light-greenish samaras that turn brown as they ripen in late October or early November. The winged fruits are 10 to 13 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) long, oblong-elliptical in shape, deeply divided at the apex and fringed along the margins with white hairs (11). Seed Production and Dissemination- Most species of elm produce good seed crops every 2 or 3 years, but seed production data for September elm are not available. The seeds are dispersed by gravity and wind. Cleaned seeds are very small, averaging about 328,500 per kilogram (149,000/lb) (1). Seedling Development- Naturally dispersed seeds overwinter in the litter or at the soil surface and germinate the following spring. Germination is epigeal (1). If seeds are to be sown in a nursery, they should be stratified at 5° C (41° F) for 60 to 90 days (1). Nursery-grown seedlings are usually outplanted as 1-0 stock. Vegetative Reproduction- September elm, like many other elms, sprouts readily when the stem is severed or badly injured. Damaged young trees sprout more readily than older trees, and sprouts grow rapidly.",Reproduction and Early Growth,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- September elm grows rapidly on good sites with low competition. Trees attain a diameter of 60 cm (24 in) to 90 cm (36 in) (4) and may reach a height of 25 m (82 ft). The tree attains the general form of American elm, but branches are smaller and somewhat more pendulous. Lower portions of large trees may provide logs of veneer quality. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- September elm is classed as tolerant of shade and probably exists most commonly as an inconspicuous understory plant during early developmental stages. Upon release, growth response is rapid, especially on better sites. If competition is minimal, however, the species will grow rapidly during all stages of development. Damaging Agents- The susceptibility of September elm to Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) is probably the greatest deterrent to its growth and development. All three mature specimens of September elm at the National Arboretum have been killed by this fungus since 1965; seedlings of the species are also very susceptible to Dutch elm disease (9). September elm has also been reported as a host of American mistletoe, Phoradendron flavescens (6).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,14,0
"September elm grows most frequently on moderately to well-drained, moist soils varying in texture from clay loams to sandy loams. It is also common on dry, rocky soils derived from limestone or other calcarous material. It is less frequent on alluvial soils along streams in rich bottoms and on the margins of swamps (4,12). The clay loams and sandy loams are principally in the order Ultisols and suborder Udults. The Udults are usually moist, with relatively low amounts of organic matter in the subsurface horizons. They are formed in humid climates that have relatively short or no dry periods during the year. September elm is reported in some localities where Alfisols and Inceptisols are present. Alfisols are medium to high in bases and have gray to brown surface horizons and clay accumulations in subsurface horizons. They are usually moist but may be dry during summer. Inceptisols have weakly differentiated horizons, with materials that have been altered or removed, but have not accumulated. These soils are also moist but may be dry during the warm season (17). September elm grows at elevations ranging from about 100 rn (325 ft) in the more southerly part of its range to about 460 m (1,500 ft) in northerly areas. Sites vary from very flat topography to moderate slopes in some of the upland coves and ravines. It has been reported, to grow in upland coves and ravines in Arkansas (14) but is notably absent from the poorly drained lowlands of the Mississippi alluvial plain (12).",Soils and Topography,September Elm,ulmus,serotina,hardwood,15,0
"The seeds of September and other elms are eaten by a variety of birds and small mammals, including squirrels. Twigs and buds are sometimes browsed by deer, and a few game birds eat the buds (3). The species has been planted as an ornamental tree in Georgia and Alabama, where it grows abundantly in hilly areas (11). This elm is also reported to thrive in Massachusetts (10). The reddish-brown wood of September elm is hard, close grained, and very strong and can be polished to a high luster. It is one of four species included as ""rock elm"" in commercial lumbering (16). This group has a specific gravity of 0.57 to 0.63 and moisture contents of 44 and 57 percent for the heartwood and sapwood, respectively.

"Two varieties of shagbark hickory are recognized: Carya ovata var. ovata, which includes C. mexicana Engelm. ex Hemsl., and C. ovata var. australis (Ashe) Little, sometimes known as C. carolinae-septentrionalis (Ashe) Engl. & Graebner and often referred to as Carolina hickory or southern shagbark hickory (11, 12). The fruits are usually longer than 3.5 cm (1.4 in); the dark brown or black terminal bud scales and the generally lanceolate or oblanceolate terminal leaflets of var. australis serve to separate it from var. ovata with its smaller fruits (less than 3.5 cm (1.4 in) long), tan or light brown bud scales, and usually obovate terminal leaflets.",Genetics,Shagbark Hickory,carya,ovata,hardwood,7,0
"Shagbark hickory is found throughout most of the Eastern United States from southeastern Nebraska and southeastern Minnesota through southern Ontario and southern Quebec to southern Maine, southward to Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and eastern Texas, and disjunctly in the mountains of northeastern Mexico. It is largely absent from the southeastern and Gulf coastal plains and lower Mississippi Delta areas. -The native range of shagbark hickory. Shagbark hickory grows best in a humid climate. It is one of the hardiest of the hickory species, however, and has successfully adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions. Within shagbark's natural range, average annual rainfall varies from 760 to 2030 mm (30 to 80 in) with 510 to 1020 mm (20 to 40 in) of rainfall during the growing season. Average snowfall usually is less than 3 cm (1 in) in the southern and southwestern portion of the tree's range to 254 cm (100 in) or more in northern New York and southern Ontario. Within the range of shagbark hickory average annual temperatures vary from 4° C (40° F) in the north to nearly 21° C (70° F) in southeastern Texas. Average January temperature varies from -9° to 13° C (15° to 55° F) while mean July temperature varies from 18° to 27° C (65° to 80° F). Extreme temperatures of -40° and 46° C (-40° and 115° F) have been recorded within shagbark's natural range. The average growing season also varies widely from about 140 days in the North to 260 days in the South. Sites occupied by shagbark hickory vary greatly. In the North it is found on upland (often south-facing) slopes, while farther south it is more prevalent on soils of alluvial origin (15,16). In the Ohio Valley, shagbark grows chiefly on north and east slopes of fertile uplands; in the Cumberland Mountains it is confined to the coves and the north and east slopes; and in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana it grows principally in river bottoms. Shagbark is found on better sites up to elevations of 910 m (3,000 ft) in the Blue Ridge Mountains of the Carolinas and on north and east-facing benches at elevations above 610 m (2,000 ft) in northern Arkansas. In northern Arkansas, shagbark hickory is often very common on clayey soils derived from Mississippian and Pennsylvanian shale formations and may represent nearly half of the stocking of privately owned woodlots on these sites. The range of shagbark hickory encompasses 7 soil orders and 14 suborders (24). Ultisols are the dominant upland soils in the southern half of the shagbark range while Alfisols and Mollisols are primary soil orders in the northern portion of the range. The soils within shagbark's range are derived from a wide variety of parent materials-sedimentary and metaphoric rocks, glacial till, and loess. The soils also represent a wide range in soil fertility, such as Alfisols and Mollisols which are high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low. Shagbark hickory is sensitive to changes in soil fertility. In the northern part of its range, the species is found on a variety of upland sites; in the southern areas, it is more common in the more fertile bottom lands and on the better north- and east-facing upland sites. Hickories are consistently present in the broad forest association commonly called oak-hickory but are not generally abundant (20). Shagbark hickory is specifically listed as a minor component in six forest cover types (7): Bur Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 42), Chestnut Oak (Type 44), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), Pin Oak-Sweetgum (Type 65), Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82), and Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91). It is also a probable associate in the Eastern White Pine (Type 21), Beech-Sugar Maple (Type 60), White Oak (Type 53), and Northern Red Oak (Type 55) forest cover types. Through most of its range, shagbark hickory is associated with oaks, other hickories, and various mixed upland hardwoods. In the South it is also associated with a number of bottom-land hardwood species.",Habitat,Shagbark Hickory,carya,ovata,hardwood,8,0
"Shagbark hickory shows a wide variety in morphological characteristics throughout its natural range and typically displays considerable diversity in nut size, shape, and color, as well as in shell thickness and in sweetness of the nutmeat (16). Based on variability in size and shape of the nut and in character and amount of pubescence on leaves and branches, five additional varieties of Carya ovata were accepted in 1933 (22), but none of these is recognized by more recent authors (6,12). Carya ovata is reported to hybridize with C. laciniosa (C. x dunbarii Sarg.) and C. cordiformis (C. x laneyi Sarg.), and a cross between shagbark and pecan has been recorded. There are five named clones of shagbark-pecan hybrids, three cultivars for shagbark-shellbark hybrids, and seven cultivars of shagbark-bitternut hybrids (13).",Hybrids,Shagbark Hickory,carya,ovata,hardwood,9,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Shagbark hickory is monoecious and flowers in the spring. The staminate catkins are 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) long and develop from axils of previous season leaves or from inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth. The pistillate flowers appear in short spikes about 8 mm (0.3 in) long on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers open when leaves are nearly full size in late March in the southwest to early June in the north and northeastern part of the range. The fruit, a nut, is variable in size and shape. Borne 1 to 3 together, individual fruits are 3 to 6 cm (I to 2.5 in) long, oval to subglobose or obovoid, depressed at the apex, and enclosed in a thin husk developed from the floral involucre. The fruit ripens in September and October and seeds are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green prior to maturity and turn brown to brownish black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and split freely to the base into four valves along grooved sutures. The enclosed nut is light brownish white, oblong-ovate, somewhat compressed, usually prominently four-angled at the apex and rounded at the base (25). The shell is relatively thin and the kernel is sweet and edible. The bulk of the edible embryonic plant is cotyledonary tissue. Seed Production and Dissemination- Shagbark hickory reaches commercial seedbearing age at 40 years. Although maximum seed production occurs from 60 to 200 years, some seed is produced up to 300 years (16). Good seed crops occur at intervals of 1 to 3 years with light crops or no seed during the intervening years. Tree diameter and crown size or surface are probably the best indicators of shagbark seed production. In southeastern Ohio, 6-year seed production of dominant and codominant shagbark hickory trees with mean d.b.h. of 20.7 cm (8.1 in) (age 60 years), 26.1 cm (10.3 in) (age 90 years) and 45.1 cm (17.8 in) (age 75 years) averaged 16, 36, and 225 sound seed per tree per year, respectively (17). Some individual shagbark trees have been known to produce 53 to 70 liters (1.5 to 2 bushels) of nuts during a good year (4). The germination of fresh seed is 50 to 75 percent. Several species of insects influence seed production by causing aborting or premature dropping of fruits or by reducing the germinative capacity of mature nuts. Especially serious are the hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana), pecan weevil (Curculio caryae), and the hickorynut curculios (Conotrachelus affinis and C. hicoriae). In good seed years about half of the total seed crop is sound, but in years of low seed production, insect depredation could be proportionally higher, and a very low percentage of sound seed is produced (17). Shagbark nuts are heavy, averaging about 220/kg (100/lb) and are disseminated primarily by gravity with some extension of seeding range caused by squirrels and chipmunks. Seedling Development- Shagbark seeds show embryo dormancy that is overcome naturally by over wintering in the duff, or artificially by stratification in a moist medium or plastic bag at about 3° C (37° F) for 90 to 120 days (3). Shagbark nuts should be stored in airtight containers at 5° C (41° F) and 90 percent relative humidity. Nuts stored longer than 2 years have lower germination percents and require only 60 days stratification (3). In forest tree nurseries, unstratified nuts are sown in the fall and stratified nuts are sown in the spring. Mulching is recommended and protection from rodents is often required (4). Germination is hypogeal. Shagbark seedlings normally produce a long taproot and very little top growth during early development. In the Ohio Valley, 1-year-old seedlings grown in the open or under light shade in red clay soil produced an average root length of 0.3 (1 t) and a top height of 7 cm (2.8 in). By age 3 the taproot extended to about 0.8 m (2.6 ft) while the top increased only to 19.8 cm (7.8 in) (16). Vegetative Reproduction- Shagbark hickory is a prolific sprouter. Nearly all of the cut or fire-killed hickories with stump diameters up to 20 to 24 cm (8 to 10 in) will produce sprouts. As stump diameters increase in size, stump sprouting declines, and proportion of root suckers increases (16). Young hickory sprouts are vigorous and can maintain a competitive position in the canopy of a newly regenerated stand. After 10 to 20 years the rate of sprout height growth declines and hickory will normally lose crown position to the faster growing oaks and associated species. Growth and Yield- Shagbark hickory is a medium-sized tree averaging 21 to 24 m (70 to 80 ft) tall, 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) in d.b.h., and may reach heights of 40 m (130 ft) with a diameter of 122 cm (48 in). The tree characteristically develops a clear straight cylindrical bole, but there is a tendency for the main stem to fork at one-half to two-thirds of the tree height (16). Although shagbark is one of the fastest growing hickories, its growth rates are less than most of the oaks and other associated species in upland stands. Representative height and d.b.h. by age are shown in table 1 for shagbark in different geographic areas. Regional volume tables for hickory trees and even-aged hickory stands are also available (2,23). Hickory normally constitutes a small percentage of the stocking in upland hardwood stands and the most appropriate per acre yields of such stands are those presented by Schnur (23), Gingrich (8), and Dale (5). Rooting Habit- Shagbark seedlings typically develop a large and deep taproot with few laterals. The taproot may penetrate to a depth of 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) in the first 3 years with a correspondingly slow growth of seedling shoots. Shagbark is rated as windfirm on most sites. Reaction to Competition- Shagbark hickory is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance. Saplings and small reproduction persist under dense overstory canopies for many years and respond rapidly when released (16). It is a climax species in much of the oak-hickory forest area. The relatively slow growth habit of shagbark (and other hickories) places it at a distinct disadvantage under the even-aged management systems presently recommended for upland hardwood stands (if rotations are less than 100 years) (19,20,21). On most sites, height growth of hickory is slower than that of oaks and associated species and by midrotation the hickories are in the subdominant crown positions and become prime candidates for removal in periodic thinnings. Since hickories are long-lived trees and have the ability to withstand shade and crowding and respond when released, they are excellent species (along with white oak) for management on long rotations (200 or more years). Damaging Agents- Shagbark hickory at all ages is susceptible to damage by fire. Light fires can result in top kill of reproduction and saplings (most of which later sprout). Hotter fires may kill larger trees and wound others, making them subject to butt rot and resultant degrade of lumber, loss of sound volume, or both (15,16). Holes made through the bark by sapsuckers (birdpeck) cause a discoloration of the wood that results in the rejection of a considerable amount of hickory lumber (18). Hickories are affected by at least 133 known fungi and 10 other diseases (9). Most of the fungi are saprophytes but a few may cause damage to foliage, produce cankers, or cause trunk or root rots. Canker rot caused by the fungus Poria spiculosa probably is the most widespread and serious of the diseases of the true hickories. Cankers form around dead branch stubs and the wood-rotting fungus can eventually spread throughout the heartwood. Though R spiculosa is the most common trunk rot species, a large number of fungi will rot the living cylinder of hickories that have been injured by fire, logging damage, etc. (9). Other common diseases of hickory are: anthracnose, (Gnomonia caryae) which causes irregular purplish- or reddish-brown spots on the upper leaf surface and dull brown spots beneath. These may merge to form irregular blotches and cause defoliation in wet seasons; mildew (Microstroma juglandis) invades leaves and twigs and may form witches' broom by stimulating bud formation; bunch disease (virus) also will cause witches'-brooms similar in appearance to those of M. Juglandis. The virus possibly is carried by sucking insects. Heavily affected trees may die prematurely. Crown gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) is a bacterial disease which causes tumors or wartlike aberrations on roots or at the base of the trunk, resulting eventually in a gradual decline and death of the tree. A gall-forming fungus species of Phomopsis can produce warty excrescences ranging from small twig galls to very large trunk burls. At least 180 species of insects and mites are reported to infest hickory trees and wood products but few cause serious damage. The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) is the most important insect enemy of hickory and other hardwoods in the Eastern United States (1). During drought periods, outbreaks often develop in the Southeast, and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to single trees or tops of trees. The foliage of infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. Control measures include felling of infested trees and destroying the bark during the winter months or storing infested logs in ponds. To be effective, this type of control should be conducted over large areas. The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) and twig pruner (Elaphidionoides villosus) often will severely prune heavily infested shade and park trees and can cause distortion in seedling and saplings in newly generated stands.",Life History,Shagbark Hickory,carya,ovata,hardwood,10,0
"Hickories serve as food for many wildlife species. The nuts are a preferred food of squirrels and are eaten from the time fruits approach maturity in early August until the supply is gone. Hickory nuts also are 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern chipmunks. In addition to the mammals above, black bears, gray and red foxes, rabbits, and white-footed mice plus bird species such as mallards, wood ducks, bobwhites, and wild turkey utilize small amounts of hickory nuts (14). Hickory is not a preferred forage species and seldom is browsed by deer when the range is in good condition. Hickory foliage is browsed by livestock only when other food is scarce. The bark texture and open irregular branching of shagbark hickory make it a good specimen tree for naturalistic landscapes on large sites. It is an important shade tree in previously wooded residential areas. At least one ornamental cultivar of shagbark hickory has been reported (10), but it is not planted as an ornamental to any great extent. The species normally contributes only a very small percentage of total biomass of a given forest stand. Its adaptability to a wide range of site conditions and vigorous sprouting when cut make shagbark a candidate for coppice fuelwood. However, difficulty in planting and generally slow growth makes shagbark less attractive than many faster growing species. Hickory has traditionally been very popular as a fuelwood and as a charcoal-producing wood. The general low percentage of hickory in the overstory of many privately owned woodlots is due in part to selective cutting of the hickory for fuelwood. Hickory fuelwood has a high heat value, burns evenly, and produces long-lasting steady heat; the charcoal gives food a hickory-smoked flavor. The wood of the true hickories is known for its strength, and no commercial species of wood is equal to it in combined strength, toughness, hardness, and stiffness (18). Dominant uses for hickory lumber are furniture, flooring, and tool handles. The combined strength, hardness, and shock resistance make it suitable for many specialty products such as ladder rungs, dowels, athletic goods, and gymnasium equipment. Shagbark hickory is probably the primary species, after pecan (Carya illinoensis), with potential for commercial nut production. The nuts have sweet kernels and fair cracking quality (which is often better in cultivars). The species can be successfully top-grafted on shagbark, and shellbark rootstocks and grafts on older rootstocks can bear in 3 to 4 years.",Special Uses,Shagbark Hickory,carya,ovata,hardwood,16,0

The range extends from western New York through southern Michigan to southeast Iowa, south through eastern Kansas into northern Oklahoma, and eastward through Tennessee into Pennsylvania. This species is most prominent in the lower Ohio River region and south along the Mississippi River to central Arkansas. It is frequently found in the great river swamps of central Missouri and the Wabash River region in Indiana and Ohio (5). The native range of shellbark hickory. The mean length of the frost-free period within the range of shellbark hickory is from 150 to 210 days. The average January temperature is between -4° and 5° C (25° and 41° F), and for July the mean temperature is from 23° to 27° (73° to 81° F). An average minimum temperature of -26° C (-15° F) occurs in the northern part of the range, and an average maximum temperature of 38° C (100° F) is found throughout the range. Precipitation varies between 750 and 1500 mm (30 and 59 in) per year including 15 to 90 cm (6 to 35 in) of snow (7). Shellbark hickory grows best on deep, fertile, moist soils, most typical of the order Alfisols. It does not thrive in heavy clay soils but grows well on heavy loams or silt loams. Shellbark hickory requires moister situations than do pignut, mockernut, or shagbark hickories (Carya glabra, C. tomentosa, or C. ovata), although it is sometimes found on dry, sandy soils. Specific nutrient requirements are not known, but generally the hickories grow best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils. The species is essentially a bottom-land species and is often found on river terraces and second bottoms. Land that is subject to shallow inundations for a few weeks early in the growing season is favorable for shellbark. However, the tree will grow on a wide range of topographic and physiographic sites (7). Shellbark hickory may be found in pure groups of several trees but is more frequent singly in association with other hardwoods. The species is a minor component of the forest cover types Bur Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 42), Pin Oak-Sweetgum (Type 65), and Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91). It may also be found in one or more of the types in which hickories are included, but it is not identified at the species level (3). Shellbark hickory commonly grows in association with American (Ulmus americana), slippery (U. rubra), and winged elms (U. alata), white (Fraxinus americana) and green ash (F pennsylvanica), basswood (Tilia americana), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), red maple (Acer rubrum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides). It is found in association with four other hickories-shagbark, mockernut, bitternut (Carya cordiformis), and water (C. aquatica), and numerous oak species, including swamp white Quercus bicolor), pin Q. palustris), white (Q. alba), Shumard (Q. shumardii), water (Q. nigra), Delta post (Q. stellata var. paludosa), swamp chestnut (Q. michauxii), and Nuttall (Q. nuttallii). The herbaceous stratum includes numerous sedges and grasses. The shrub and small tree layer may be composed of painted buckeye (Aesculus sylvatica), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), possumhaw (Ilex decidua), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and trumpet-creeper (Campsis radicans).",Habitat,Shellbark Hickory,carya,laciniosa,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Shellbark hickory is monoecious, producing flowers from April to June after the leaves appear. The male flowers develop from the axils of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth. The female flowers appear in short spikes or peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year. The pollen is wind disseminated. The fruit ripens from September to November (2). Seed Production and Dissemination- Shellbark nuts are the largest produced by any hickory. The number of cleaned seed per kilogram ranges from 55 to 75 (25 to 35/lb). Hickories show embryo dormancy. Shellbark hickory seeds require from 90 to 120 days of cold stratification before they will germinate. The minimum tree age for seed production is about 40 years, with the most seed produced between 75 and 200 years. Thrifty trees may produce 70 to 105 liters (2 to 3 bu) of nuts in a good year, and good crops are produced about every second year (2). The seed is dispersed from September to December by gravity, birds, and animals. Squirrels and other rodents are the principal dispersal agents (7). Seedling Development- Shellbark hickory requires moist soil for good germination and establishment. Germination is hypogeal. Seeds germinate from late April to early June. The seedlings rapidly develop a long taproot, but shoot growth is initially slow. Shellbark hickory seedlings grow faster in height than most of the other hickories (7). Shellbark hickory is shade tolerant in early life and reproduces under forest conditions. Under light shade height growth may be slow. In the Ohio Valley, seedlings were only 11 cm (4 in) tall after 1 year and 56 cm (22 in) tall at the end of 5 years. Vegetative Reproduction- Shellbark hickory sprouts readily when cut, and coppice management has been recommended for this and other hickories. It is a persistent sprouter following fire and/or grazing. Although more difficult to propagate by grafting and budding than fruit trees, this species can be reproduced by these techniques with good success. It is not known whether shellbark hickory will root from cuttings. Growth and Yield- The hickories as a group grow slowly in diameter, and shellbark hickory is no exception. Sapling size trees average 2 mm (0.08 in) per year in diameter growth, increasing to 3 mm (0.12 in) per year as poles and sawtimber. Second-growth trees show growth rates of 5 mm (0.20 in) per year. Shellbark hickory occasionally grows to a height of 40 in (131 ft) and a diameter of 100 cm (39 in) (7). Rooting Habit- Shellbark hickory develops a large taproot that penetrates deeply into the soil. Lateral roots emerge at nearly right angles to the taproot, spreading horizontally through the soil. No distinct major lateral roots develop. In Illinois, root growth was rapid in April, slowed during July and August, increased again in September, and ended in late November (7). Mycorrhizal associations are formed when trees are young. The only specific fungus identified from shellbark hickory roots is an ectotrophic mycorrhiza, Laccaria ochropurpurea (8). Reaction to Competition- Shellbark hickory is very shade tolerant, exceeded only by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia). It grows slowly under a dense canopy, however. In stands with only partial shade, it reproduces well. It is a very strong competitor in most of the species associations in which it is found. Under forest conditions, shellbark hickory often develops a clear bole for half its length and has a narrow, oblong crown. Open-grown trees have egg-shaped crowns (7). Heavy release sometimes results in epicormic branching. Damaging Agents- Although numerous insects and diseases affect hickories, shellbark hickory has no enemies that seriously threaten its development or perpetuation as a species. Seed production can be reduced significantly, however, through attack by several insects. Two of the most important are the pecan weevil (Curculio caryae) and the hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana). The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) feeds in the cambium and seriously weakens or even kills some trees. Adults of the hickory spiral borer (Agrilus arcuatus torquatus) feed on leaves, but the larvae feed beneath the bark and can be very destructive to hickory seedlings. The flatheaded appletree borer (Chrysobothris femorata) likewise is a foliage feeder as an adult, but its larvae feed on the phloem and outer sapwood. The living-hickory borer (Goes pulcher) feeds in the trunks and branches of trees. A twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) can seriously affect reproduction by killing back the tops of seedlings and sprouts. Both standing dead trees and freshly cut logs are highly susceptible to attacks by numerous species of wood borers. A large number of insect species feed on hickory foliage. None of them cause serious problems for shellbark hickory, although they may be responsible for some stem deformity and growth loss (1). Shellbark hickory is free of serious diseases, but it is a host species for a variety of fungi. More than 130 fungi have been identified from species of Carya. These include leaf disease, stem canker, wood rot, and root rot-causing fungi. Specific information for shellbark hickory is not available (4). Shellbark hickory is susceptible to bole injury from fire, and fire injuries are often invaded by wood rot fungi. It is resistant to snow and ice damage but is susceptible to frost damage.",Life History,Shellbark Hickory,carya,laciniosa,hardwood,10,0
"Shellbark hickory nuts are used for food by ducks, quail, wild turkeys, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, foxes, raccoons, and white-footed mice. A few plantations of shellbark hickory have been established for nut production, but the nuts are difficult to crack even though the kernel is sweet. The wood is used for furniture, tool handles, sporting goods, veneer, fuelwood, and charcoal.",Special Uses,Shellbark Hickory,carya,laciniosa,hardwood,16,0
"Shortleaf pine is now considered a major component of three forest cover types (Society of American Foresters, 16), Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Shortleaf Pine-Oak (Type 76), and Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80). Although shortleaf pine grows very well on good sites, it is generally only temporary and gives way to more competitive species, particularly hardwoods. It is more competitive on drier sites with thin, rocky, and nutrient deficient soils. With the species' ability to grow on the medium and poor sites, it is not surprising that shortleaf pine is a minor component of at least 15 other forest cover types. 21 Eastern White Pine 40 Post Oak-Blackjack Oak 43 Bear Oak 44 Chestnut Oak 45 Pitch Pine 46 Eastern Redcedar 51 White Pine-Chestnut Oak 52 White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak 57 Yellow-Popular 70 Longleaf Pine 78 Virginia Pine-Oak 79 Virginia Pine 81 Loblolly Pine 82 Loblolly Pine--Hardwood 110 Black Oak In addition to species in the cover types, other common associates include scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), southern red oak (Q. falcata), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens), mockernut and pignut hickories (Carya tomentosa and C. glabra), winged elm (Ulmus alata), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), red maple (Acer rubrum), water oak (Quercus nigra), willow oak (Q. phellos), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and Carolina ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). Common understory woody plants include mountainlaurel (Kalmia latifolia), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), redbud (Cercis canadensis), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana). Among the more common understory shrubs vines, and herbaceous vegetation are blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), huckleberries (Gaylussacia spp.), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), greenbriers (Smilax spp.), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), grape (Vitis spp.), asters (Aster spp., tick-trefoil (Desmodium spp.), tickseed (Coreopsis spp.), bushclover (Lespedeza spp.), St. Andrews cross (Ascyrum hypericoides var. multicaule), birdfoot violet (Viola pedata), sensitive brier (Schrankia spp.), early azalea (Rhododendron roseum), pussytoes (Antennaria spp.), butterfly-pea (Clitoria mariana), senna (Cassia spp.), bugbanes (Cimicifuga spp.), longleaf uniola (Uniola longifolia), panicums (Panicum spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), and bluestems (Andropogon spp.).",Associated Forest Cover,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,1,1
"Shortleaf pine grows in a fairly humid region but is the least exacting of the southern pines as to temperature and moisture (18). Annual precipitation averages between 1020 mm (40 in) on the western edge of its range and 1520 mm (60 in) at the southern tip of its range (59). Snowfall averages less than 41 cm (16 in) over most of the shortleaf pine range but may be twice that amount in some of the higher elevations of the Appalachians northward into Pennsylvania. The region of best development for the species is in Arkansas, northern Louisiana, and the southern Piedmont, where precipitation ranges from 1140 to 1400 mm (45 to 55 in) and averages 1270 mm (50 in). The 10° C (50° F) average annual temperature isoline closely parallels the northern limit of shortleaf pine. Over its range, average annual temperatures vary from 9° C (48° F) in New Jersey to 21° C (70° F) in southeast Texas.",Climate,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,2,1
"Because of shortleaf pine's wide distribution and the range in elevation at which it grows, considerable racial variation has developed. The Southwide Pine Seed Source Study indicated important racial differences in height, volume growth, survival, and degree of early cone production (63,65). Seed collection and planting zones have been drawn for shortleaf pine on the basis of these results (62,64). The zones are primarily a function of latitude, with much wider movement of seed being acceptable in an east-west direction than north-south. There is some indication that the shortleaf pine population west of the Mississippi River has an inherently faster growth rate than the eastern population (64). Other studies have revealed differences in height growth, volume growth, wood specific gravity, chemical content, and foliage color (14). Shortleaf pine from some locations grew faster than loblolly pine, but loblolly was generally the faster growing species. In Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia, shortleaf pine planted on sites where littleleaf disease was likely to occur revealed that trees were healthier from locations west to east, and those from upland locations were healthier than those from coastal plain areas. Specific gravity of shortleaf pine has been shown to increase slightly from the north to the south (19), and monoterpene chemical composition of wood oleoresin as found to vary in a clinal pattern, with a-pinene increasing from east to west while b-pinene decreased (12). Natural hybridization of shortleaf pine and loblolly pine west of the Mississippi River is considered to be extensive and is probably a cause of many inherent variations in the species (24). Such hybridization would contribute to variation among trees through creation of intermediate types and introgression towards one or both parent species. The natural variations of shortleaf pine have been the basis for selecting trees having superior qualities. These qualities include growth rate, stem and crown form, resistance to littleleaf and other diseases, wood specific gravity, tracheid length, extractives, oleoresin content, and seed production (14). Many of these traits have been the basis for selecting individual trees for seed orchards, which are rapidly becoming the primary source of seeds for planting programs. In 1974, there were 190.6 ha (471 acres) of shortleaf seed orchards in the United States, with 158.2 ha (391 acres) in Federal management (56); more than half of the total acreage is in Arkansas. Several artificial hybrids have been produced with shortleaf pine. They are of special interest because they offer the opportunity to combine specific qualities of individual species. For example, shortleaf pine can be crossed with slash pine (Pinus elliottii) to yield progeny that are resistant to fusiform rust, a disease to which slash pine is highly susceptible. Shortleaf pine has been successfully crossed with slash, loblolly, longleaf, and Sonderegger pines (P. elliottii, P. taeda, P. palustris, and P. x sondereggeri) (50,55). Some of the hybrids have also been backcrossed. Shortleaf pine x loblolly pine hybrids have also shown resistance to fusiform rust, have grown as well as or better than one or both parents, and have shown increased resistance to cold and ice damage (30). Characteristics of most shortleaf hybrids, as well as other pine hybrids, are intermediate between the parent species. Fusiform rust resistance of shortleaf x slash hybrids, however, is closer to shortleaf pine than slash pine (66). The longleaf x shortleaf pine hybrid is difficult to produce and crosses have yielded only a few seedlings. These have shown intermediate characteristics, but seedling height growth was not delayed as it is characteristically for longleaf pine. Shortleaf x pitch pine (P. echinata x P. rigida) and Table Mountain x shortleaf pine (P. pungens x P. echinata) hybrids have also been produced and generally have intermediate characteristics (14).",Genetics,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,7,1
"Shortleaf pine has the widest range of any pine in the southeastern United States. It grows in 22 States over more than 1 139 600 km² (440,000 mi²), from southeastern New York and New Jersey west to Pennsylvania, southern Ohio, Kentucky, southwestern Illinois, and southern Missouri; south to eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas; and east to northern Florida and northeast through the Atlantic Coast States to Delaware (33). In 1915, shortleaf pine was reported to grow in 24 States. Fossil pollen found in Michigan suggests that it may have once grown there (18). - The native range of shortleaf pine.",Native Range,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Shortleaf pine is monoecious (29). Male and female strobili emerge from late March in the southwestern part of its range to late April in the northeastern sections. Open-grown trees may produce strobili 2 weeks earlier (18). Male strobili are more common on the basal part of new shoots, mostly on older lateral branches in the lower crown. The male strobili are arranged in indistinct spirals in clusters 1.3 to 5.1 cm (0.5 to 2.0 in) long. They may be green or yellow to reddish purple before ripening but become brown to light brown at the time of pollen shed. Female strobili emerge from the winter bud soon after the male strobili and are green or red to purple. They are nearly erect at the time of pollination, and 1.0 to 3.8 cm (0.4 to 1.5 in) long. After pollination, scales of the female strobili close and slow development begins. By the end of the first growing season they are about one-eighth to one-fifth the length of mature cones. Cones develop rapidly after fertilization takes place in early spring or summer of the second growing season. They mature by late summer or early fall and are green to light or dull brown when ripe (29). Shortleaf pine generally does not bear seeds until about 20 years of age, but both male and female flowers have been reported on 5-year-old trees. Viable seeds have been produced on 9-year-old trees, although this is exceptional. Trees usually produce seeds abundantly when they reach a diameter of about 30 cm (12 in) (18). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seedfall usually begins in late October or early November when cones reach a specific gravity of about 0.88 or when they will float in SAE 20 motor oil (60). As the cones dry, the bracts open, allowing the winged seeds to fall out. Most seeds fall fairly close to the tree from which they originate, but in varying patterns. In an Arkansas study, half of the shortleaf pine seeds fell into a forest clearing within 20 m (66 ft) of forest walls 21 m (70 ft) high, and 85 percent fell within 50 m (165 ft) of the forest walls (71). Wall height and orientation and prevailing wind direction had little effect on the dispersal pattern, probably because of topographic features and frontal winds. In other observations, however, where prevailing winds were from one direction during seedfall, seeds were dispersed in a v-shaped pattern with the apex at the base of the tree. Under such conditions, several times as many seeds were caught in traps at a distance of 40 m (132 ft) from the tree on the leeward side as were caught at a distance of 20 m (66 ft) on the windward side (18). About 70 percent of the seeds fall within a month after maturity and 90 percent within 2 months. Some seeds continue to fall into April, and cones persist on the tree long after they are empty (18,71). Shortleaf pine cones yield about 25 to 38 full seeds each (18,72) or about 0.9 to 1.4 kg (2 to 3 lb) of seeds per 45 kg (100 lb) of cones. The number of cleaned seeds per kilogram ranges from 70,800 to 160,700 (32,100 to 72,900 per pound) and averages 102,100 (46,300) (29). The number of seeds produced per tree and number of seeds per cone can be significantly increased by releasing seed trees from competition (71), although the number of seeds per cone may not always increase (43). The average number of cones per tree for unreleased trees was 498 compared with 1,069 for those released from competition (72). Releasing seed trees by removing hardwoods and thinning from below to densities at least as low as 11.5 m²/ha (50 ft²/acre) greatly increases seed production in shortleaf pine stands (43). Good to excellent cone crops occur every 3 to 10 years in the Northeast and 3 to 6 years in the South (18). In the Georgia Piedmont, seed crops were most frequent in the northern portions (6). Shortleaf pine seed production was studied in natural stands in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri during a 10-year period from 1965 through 1974 (57). The lowest production was 4,900 sound seeds per hectare (2,000/acre) and the highest was 1,845,800/ha (747,000/acre). Seed yields of at least 66,700/ha (27,000/acre) occurred in 7 of the 10 years, and no consecutive 2-year periods had less than 79,100/ha (32,000/acre). In another study (72), the lowest seed production from 25 trees per hectare (10/acre) for three consecutive 3-year periods was 761,100/ha (308,000/acre). Seedling Development- Shortleaf pine seeds that lie on the ground during the winter are naturally stratified and epigeous germination takes place in early spring. There is some evidence that a few seeds do not germinate until the second year, but this phenomenon has not been verified. Many seeds are eaten by birds and small mammals, and only a few actually germinate and produce seedlings. Seedbed treatments that expose mineral soil tend to increase the initial establishment of seedlings (4,18,31,73). Scarification during logging and burning provide effective site preparation for natural regeneration of shortleaf pine. Control of hardwood competition is also necessary to insure survival of seedlings, although some residual hardwoods have the beneficial effect of shading and protecting them from drying winds, especially on southerly aspects during the first few years after establishment. Generally, about 100 sound seeds are required to establish each seedling, although this number varies considerably depending on seedbed condition, seed year, and environmental factors (73). Shortleaf pine seedlings may also be established by direct seeding, the success of which depends on suitability of sites and seedbeds, protection of seeds from birds and rodents, amount of seeds and timing of sowing, and control of competition. Suitable seedbeds are obtainable by mechanical site preparation, such as mowing, disking, shearing and raking, roller drum chopping, ripping, prescribed burning, chemical treatments, or hand methods, such as kicking or raking off litter. Combinations of these techniques are often used to provide the most effective site preparation (4,47). It is necessary to select good quality seeds that have been properly collected, stored, stratified, and treated with bird and rodent repellents. Seedlots should have 95 percent purity and at least 80 percent germinative capacity (4). Even properly stratified seed should be treated with repellents (13). Seeding at two or three times the normal rate has been done, but this is an expensive and risky way to combat seed depredation (47). For broadcast seeding, a rate of about 0.56 kg/ha (0.5 lb/acre) is recommended, although about half this amount is adequate for well-prepared seedbeds (13). For spot seeding, three to five seeds should be dropped on each spot. Row seeding requires single seeds spaced about 30 cm (12 in) apart along the row, furrow, or line (4). It is better to sow at relatively high rates initially with any seeding method, then adjust rates for the local conditions as experience dictates (47). Both natural seedfall and direct seeding have the disadvantage of high variability in achieved stocking levels, although these methods are generally much less expensive to apply. Shortleaf pine seedlings are commonly produced in nurseries and outplanted as 1-year-old, bare-rooted nursery stock. Seeds are usually stratified for about 60 days at 1° to 5° C (34° to 41° F), sown in the spring at the rate of 430/m² (40/ft²), pressed into the soil, and mulched with burlap or chopped pine needles (29). Seedling densities as low as 270/m² (25/ft²) are currently being considered with other nursery practice modifications to provide seedlings that will have better survival and growth (4). Nursery-grown seedlings develop rapidly and are ready for lifting and outplanting by late fall. Occasionally, seedlings are grown to larger sizes for planting on difficult sites or for special purposes. Care must be taken to insure proper lifting, handling, and storage of seedlings throughout the entire planting process. The safest time to plant the seedlings is from late February to early March, after most of the severe weather has passed. Planting in April or May is not recommended because seedlings may be lost to drought and severe competition from established vegetation. Seedlings are currently being planted at spacings of 2.4 x 2.4 m (8 x 8 ft) to 3.0 x 3.0 m (10 x 10 ft), which provide 1,683 to 1,077 seedlings per hectare (681 to 436 per acre), respectively (4). Planting of containerized seedlings generally allows more efficient use of seed, provides better survival and faster initial growth, and extends the planting season. Depending on the type of container, the seedling may be either planted with the container or removed before planting (2,3,46). Shortleaf pine seedlings develop a persistent J-shaped crook near the ground surface at 2 to 3 months of age. The stem is usually prostrate as shoot growth begins but subsequently turns upward, forming the crook. Axillary and other buds form near the crook and initiate growth if the upper stem is killed by fire or is severed (18). Shortleaf pine seedlings grow slowly as the root system develops during the first year or two after establishment. The developing seedlings and saplings attain most of their height growth early in the growing season, usually by early July (18). Shortleaf pines show growth response to late-season rainfall, however, if it is sufficient to replenish soil water. Average annual height growth during the sapling stage ranges between 0.3 and 0.9 m (1 and 3 ft) depending on locality and site conditions (18,36,53,69). Competition from woody plants (35) and non-woody plants (15) is highly detrimental to growth and development of shortleaf pine seedlings and saplings (8,31,47). Preharvest hardwood control by stem injection, soil application of herbicide, and rotary mowing with herbicide spraying facilitated establishment of loblolly and shortleaf pine natural regeneration in a 75- to 80-year-old stand in southern Arkansas. After 3 years, the hardwood control treatments provided optimum pine seedling stocking and significantly taller pine seedlings than the plots without hardwood control (8). Ripping of soils on eroded, compacted, or rocky sites followed by planting in the rips has improved performance of seedlings (4). Elimination of overstory competition resulted in 60-percent survival of 5-year-old trees compared with 16 percent where the overstory remained. Heights of the tallest seedlings at age 5 were 18 cm (7 in) on the untreated and 122 cm (48 in) on the treated area (18). On the Cumberland Plateau, shortleaf pine seedlings that were suppressed for 2 years after underplanting in a low-grade hardwood stand resumed good growth after the overstory was killed, but a year's height growth was lost for each year of deferred release (47). Vegetative Reproduction- Shortleaf pine can be vegetatively propagated by either rooting or grafting of scions, but techniques for production of new plants from parts such as pollen grains are lacking. Grafting of scions or twigs from special trees to trees of the same species is the most commonly used method of propagating southern pines. It is possible, but difficult, to root needle bundles and cuttings of twigs. Shortleaf pine can also be air-layered (14). Young shortleaf pines sprout vigorously at the root collar if the crown is killed or badly damaged, a feature which probably contributes much to the species' survival where other species decline. The ability to sprout profusely is generally confined to trees up to 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) in diameter. Most sprouts eventually die, leaving from one to three stems to develop. Shoots also arise from buds developing in needle fascicles below the point of injury (18).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Shortleaf pines on good sites attain a height of 30 m (100 ft) or more and diameters (d.b.h.) of 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in). Heights of nearly 40 m (130 ft) and d.b.h. of 122 cm (48 in) have been recorded (18), but the practice of growing trees to over 70 years of age is not commonly followed in managed stands because net growth rates decline rapidly. One of the biggest shortleaf pines grows in Mississippi. It measures 105 cm (41.5 in) in d.b.h. and 42 m (138 ft) tall and attests to the large size these trees may attain. Considering the importance of shortleaf pine, the information available on growth and yield is limited (40). The first variable-density yield information for a variety of sites and ages in natural stands was developed from forest survey data (39,41). The model provides volume and basal area predictions for natural, even-aged, shortleaf pine stands in the West Gulf region. For example, a 60-year-old stand with a basal area of 16.1 m²/ha (70 ft²/acre) and a site index of 21.3 m (70 ft) would have a sawtimber volume of 119.8 m³/ha (1,712 ft³/acre) for trees 23 cm (9 in) d.b.h. and larger (39). For trees 13 cm (5 in) d.b.h. and larger, the volume would be 129.6 m³/ha (1,851 ft³/acre)(41). These yields are for a broad range of stand conditions, including unmanaged stands and those with a significant hardwood component. Managed stands should provide greater yields. Data from uneven-aged shortleaf pine stands in the Interior Highlands of Arkansas were used to construct a similar model (42). After the cyclic harvest levels have stabilized, the periodic annual growth (based on International 1/4-inch rule) for these stands is 5.3 m³/ha (381 fbm/acre), with a residual after cut volume of 89.3 m³/ha (6,378 fbm/acre). Stand structure and yield data for shortleaf pine plantations in the Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia Highlands show that with a site index of 18.3 m (60 ft) at base age 25 years, mean annual increment of total volume culminates near age 20 (54), at about 15.8 m³/ha (225 ft³/acre). Total volume yield (outside bark) of all trees at age 40, where the site index is 9.1 m (30 ft) and density is 3,090 stems per hectare (1,250/acre), is about 180 m³/ha (2,570 ft³/acre). For the same age and planting density, the volume where site index is 18.3 m (60 ft) is about 451 m³/ha (6,446 ft³/acre). Basal areas for these two stand conditions are 31 and 39 m²/ha (135 and 171 ft²/acre), respectively. The actual numbers of trees are 1,870 and 875/ha (757 and 354/acre). Thinnings in such stands will likely provide greater volume production through capture of mortality and will increase average diameter (68). Natural shortleaf pine stands in Missouri showed significantly higher net volume yields when thinned to about 21 m²/ha (90 ft²/acre) or above, at age 51. The presence of hardwoods reduced growth and yield of the stands by 8 to 12 percent (48). In south Arkansas, annual growth of uneven-aged shortleaf-loblolly pine stands averaged 5.9 m³/ha (84 ft³/acre) during a 24-year measurement period (44). Annual sawtimber growth of these stands averaged 6.0 m³/ha (432 fbm/acre). Rooting Habit- Shortleaf pine seedlings can develop a taproot at an early age, which may become quite massive if allowed to grow uninhibited (38). If the taproot is damaged, the seedling can grow a new one (34). In much of the region where shortleaf pine grows, however, taproots do not develop because of shallow, rocky soils and in some cases hardpans. Lateral roots tend to grow near the soil surface; they are generally concentrated in the upper 46 cm (18 in) of the soil and rarely occur below a depth of 102 cm (40 in). Tree growth response tends to be related to root development. The cross-sectional area of roots at groundline and the composite root area or sum of the areas of the first-order lateral roots plus the area of the taproot of 3- to 9-year-old shortleaf pines from Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas were found to be highly correlated. This suggests that basal stem diameter growth is directly related to root development (11). Root systems of trees originating from natural or artificial seeding are more likely to have a single taproot than planted trees. Trees with root systems oriented downward have better height growth than trees with surface-oriented root systems (26). Reaction to Competition- Shortleaf pine is a shade-intolerant species and does not survive or grow well when suppressed (16). Young shortleaf pines are generally slower growing and slower to dominate a site than loblolly pine or many hardwood competitors, but they usually will endure competition longer than its common associate, loblolly pine. Shortleaf pine can maintain dominance on most sites after it overtops competing vegetation, but in general hardwoods cannot be eliminated from pine sites (7,9,10). On very good sites, however, it may not outgrow competing species such as sweetgum and red maple. Control of both woody and non-woody competition usually results in economic gains (15,35). In young, well-stocked shortleaf pine stands, trees begin to compete with each other within a few years after establishment, and diameter growth rates decline (69). Even though growth rates decline, shortleaf pine persists in very dense stands. Natural pruning occurs as the canopies close, but it is slower than on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) or longleaf pine (P. palustris). Shortleaf pine usually responds well to release, even when the trees are mature (18,72). Removal of understory competition may also increase growth rates (5). Because of its intolerance to shade and other environmental factors, shortleaf pine commonly grows in even-aged stands (22,32). Natural and artificial regeneration methods are used to establish such stands (4). Uneven-aged management is feasible, however, and may be an attractive alternative for small tracts of land (44,45,67). Damaging Agents- Littleleaf disease is the most serious pathological threat to shortleaf pine, occurring on poorly drained soils from Virginia to Mississippi and south to the Gulf Coast (61). The disease results from combination of certain factors, including root destruction by Phytophthora cinnamomi, periodic excessive soil moisture deficits, poor aeration, low fertility, damage from nematodes, and perhaps toxic levels of manganese. These forces combine to impede mineral absorption, particularly nitrogen (18,27). Symptoms of the disease usually appear when the stands are 30 to 50 years old, but seldom in stands less than 20 years old. Growth rates of infected trees may be greatly reduced, and mortality may be very high. Fertilization with nitrogen at 224 kg(ha (200 lb/acre) can relieve some of the symptoms in its early stages. No practical control measures for littleleaf disease in forest stands have been developed. It is suggested that proper site selection, species selection, and maintenance of stand vigor are the best defenses against this disease (18,52). Shortleaf saplings and older trees are moderately susceptible to attack by Heterobasidion annosum, a root rot. Losses in thinned plantations and occasionally in natural stands have occurred, but they have not been in general. Red heart, caused by Phellinus pini, may occur in older trees but is rare in stands under 80 years old. Several other relatively unimportant diseases occur in shortleaf pine (27). Shortleaf pine seedlings are subject to damping off and root rot caused by several fungi, usually when soils have a pH above 6 and weather conditions are wet. Foliage of shortleaf pine normally does not develop serious diseases, but at least eight needle rusts are known to attack the species (27). Brown spot from Scirrhia acicola may be aggressive. The rust, Cronartium comandrae, has occasionally damaged shortleaf seedlings. Young shortleaf pines are attacked by Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana). This insect has become a major pest in the eastern United States and may have greater impacts on growth than previously believed. Chemical control of this pest is difficult in forest situations, although early results of spray applications have shown promise. The redheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion lecontei) is our most destructive sawfly, and shortleaf is one of its preferred species. Loblolly pine sawfly (N. taedae linearis), attacks shortleaf pine in at least eight States. Reproduction weevils are the most serious insect pests of pine seedlings, reportedly killing 20 to 30 percent of seedlings planted in cutover pine lands. Pales weevil (Hylobius pales), and pitch-eating weevil, (Pachylobius picivorus), are most destructive species over the eastern and southern United States (1,17). The southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), occasionally causes great losses. Other important insects are the pine engraver beetles (Ips spp.), especially during severe droughts, and the black turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus terebrans). Shortleaf pine is generally fire resistant, but wildfires in young plantations are very damaging. The crowns are usually killed, but shortleaf pine will sprout from the base and form new stems. Larger trees may be killed by very hot fires, particularly if fuels near the tree bases are heavy. Fire damaged trees are also more susceptible to insect damage (1). Shortleaf pine is generally considered to be windfirm over most of its range, although trees may be uprooted by wind where root systems are shallow (18). Shortleaf pines may also be damaged by severe ice storms. A single ice storm resulted in loss of almost one-third of the volume in a very heavily stocked shortleaf pine stand in north Arkansas (37). Thinned, pole-size stands are especially susceptible to damage, which often includes main stem breakage. Acid rain may reduce growth of shortleaf pine (28). It may also result in aluminum toxicity to the roots of young trees, but could improve growth through increased availability of mineral nutrients (49). Extreme drought can result in or contribute to mortality of shortleaf pine (70).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,14,1
"Shortleaf pine's adaptability to a great variety of site and soil conditions partly accounts for its wide distribution. The best growth rate is on South Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain soils. However, most of the soils that shortleaf pine occupies are classed in the order Ultisols and suborder Udults. Soils in this suborder are usually moist and relatively low in organic matter in subsurface horizons. They are formed in humid climates that have short or few dry periods during the year. Two great soil groups, Paleudults and Hapludults, include the primary soils occupied by shortleaf pine. Paleudults have a thick horizon of clay accumulation without appreciable weatherable materials. Hapludults may have either relatively thin clay subsurface horizons or a subsurface horizon with appreciable weatherable materials, or both. Shortleaf pine may occupy soils in other orders, but they do not constitute a significant part of its range (58). Shortleaf pine grows best on deep, well-drained soils having fine sandy loam or silty loam textures. These soils are found primarily on flood plains. Site indices for shortleaf pine on these sites may exceed 30 m (100 ft). Very shallow, rocky soils on upland sites in the lower rainfall sections of the species' range have very low site indices, sometimes as low as 10 m (33 ft) (21). In the upland areas of its range, site indices at base age 50 years for natural stands average between 15 m (50 ft) and 23 m (75 ft) (20,25). In north Mississippi, site indices of sample plots ranged from 6 m (20 ft) to 30 m (97 ft) for shortleaf pine plantations varying in age from 17 to 29 years (69). Shortleaf pine does not grow well on soils with a high calcium content, high pH, or excessive internal drainage. It is also reported to be more abundant than loblolly pine on the drier, better drained, and less fertile soils in the Piedmont. The difference is partly attributable to shortleaf pine's larger root system, lower tolerance to poor soil aeration, and lower demand for nutrients (18). Shortleaf pine grows at elevations as low as 3 m (10 ft) in southern New Jersey and up to 910 m (3,000 ft) in the Appalachian Mountains. It grows up to 300 m (1,000 ft) in Pennsylvania. Its best development is attained at elevations of 180 m (600 ft) to 460 m (1,500 ft) in the Piedmont and 45 m (150 ft) to 350 m (1,150 ft) in Louisiana and Arkansas, although it grows at elevations up to 610 m (2,000 ft) in Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma (16,18).",Soils and Topography,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,15,1
"Shortleaf pine is primarily used for lumber, plywood, other structural materials, and pulpwood. Even the taproots are used for pulpwood. The species was commonly planted on eroded lands in Mississippi (68) but does not produce as much litter as loblolly pine and therefore may be less desirable for some reclamation uses. Shortleaf pine is sometimes planted as an evergreen ornamental and as a screen in urban areas. The seeds of shortleaf pine are eaten by birds and small mammals. Squirrels may cut the cones and eat the seeds before the cones open naturally (23). The canopies of shortleaf pine provide protection from the wind and cold for many animals. Stands of shortleaf pine scattered through hardwood forests are especially beneficial to wildlife. Older shortleaf pines with red heart rot (Phellinus pini) are primary nesting trees for the red-cockaded woodpecker (51).",Special Uses,Shortleaf Pine,pinus,echinata,conifer,16,1
"Shumard oak is included in the forest cover type Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 91), a bottom-land type of the Southern Forest Region (1). Shumard oak is a prominent hardwood associate of this type, along with green and white ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica and F. americana), the hickories, shagbark (Carya ovata), shellbark (C. laciniosa), mockernut (C. tomentosa), and bitternut (C. cordiformis), as well as white oak (Quercus alba), Delta post oak (Q. stellata var. paludosa) and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Main associates in the type are willow oak (Quercus phellos), water oak (Q. falcata), southern red oak (Q. falcata var. falcata), post oak (Q. stellata), American elm (Ulmus americana), winged elm (U. alata), water hickory (Carya aquatica), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), beech (Fagus grandifolia), and occasionally loblolly (Pinus taeda) and spruce (P. glabra) pines. Shumard oak is often included in cover types Ash-Juniper-Redberry (Pinchot) Juniper (Type 66) and Mohrs (Shin) Oak (Type 67). Some of the other associates of Shumard oak include red buckeye (Aesculus pavia), devils-walkingstick (Aralia spinosa), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), witch-hazel (Hamamelis uirginiana), American holly (Ilex opaca), red mulberry (Morus rubra), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), and American basswood (Tilia caroliniana).",Associated Forest Cover,Shumard Oak,quercus,shumardii,hardwood,1,0
"Usually Shumard oak grows in a humid, temperate climate, characterized by hot summers and mild, short winters. The growing season usually extends from 210 to 250 days through the major portion of the species commercial range. The average annual temperature is 16° to 21° C (60° to 70° F) with an average annual precipitation of 1140 to 1400 mm (45 to 55 in). The annual maximum temperature for this area is 38° C (100° F) and the annual minimum temperature is about -9° C (15° F). The majority of the rainfall occurs from April through September. Shumard oak tolerates drought well, as shown by its presence in parts of Texas and Oklahoma where the average annual rainfall is only about 640 mm (25 in) (7).",Climate,Shumard Oak,quercus,shumardii,hardwood,2,0

"Shumard oak is found in the Atlantic Coastal Plain primarily from North Carolina to northern Florida and west to central Texas; it is also found north in the Mississippi River Valley to central Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois, Indiana, western and southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It is found locally north to southern Michigan, southern Pennsylvania, and Maryland (4). -The native range of Shumard oak.",Native Range,Shumard Oak,quercus,shumardii,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Shumard oak is monoecious. Its flowers usually appear in March or April; they are unisexual, with stamens in glabrous 15 to 18 cm. (6 to 7 in) long aments and the pistils are single or paired on pubescent stalks. The fruit is an egg-shaped acorn 2.5 cm (1 in) long, enclosed at the base in a thick, flat, saucer-shaped cup with pubescent scales. The acorn ripens and falls during September or October of its second year. Seed Production and Dissemination- The minimum seed-bearing age for Shumard oak is 25 years and optimum production is about 50 years. The interval between seed crops is 2 to 3 years. There are about 23 kg (50 lb) of seeds per 35 liters (bushel) of fruit. The range of cleaned seeds per kilogram is 172 to 282 (78 to 128/lb) with an average of 220 (100) (8). Acorns of Shumard oak are an excellent wildlife food and are consumed by birds, white-tailed deer, and squirrels. Animals that hoard the acorns also disseminate them. This species frequently produces multiseeded acorns. Seedling Development- As with other oaks, germination is hypogeal (8). It appears that the microclimate, edaphic conditions, and several stand variables all have a definite influence on the quantity Of small established oak regeneration, but their effect is probably overshadowed by the seed supply. Where oak regeneration is to be favored in uneven-age management, large openings appear most desirable. In even-age management, when a seed-tree cut is contemplated, extremely large- or small-diameter trees should be left as seed producers only as a last resort (2). The species needs full light to achieve good reproduction. In the Coastal Plain, Shumard oak is found mostly on sites with rich, well-drained soils and an abundance of moisture, but it may also inhabit dry, upland sites. The stems of the young seedlings are smooth, brownish green or light gray, changing to gray or grayish brown by midseason of the first year. Buds are ovoid with acute apex, 6 min (0.25 in) long, smooth, with closely overlapping gray-brown or dull straw-colored scales (5). Vegetative Reproduction- Shumard oak does not propagate readily on moist sites or by cuttings.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Shumard Oak,quercus,shumardii,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Shumard oak grows quite large, especially on favorable bottom-land sites where it reaches a height of 30.5 m (100 ft) or more with a trunk diameter of 0.9 to 1.2 in (3 to 4 ft). Its shape is characterized by a clear trunk and spreading crown. In a report describing the concentration of hardwood species on pine sites, cubic volume is reported for all sites (pine and hardwood) as 7.3 million m³ (259 million ft³) in 11 Southern States. The total volume on pine sites is 3.4 million m³ (120 million ft³ (6). Heavy pole stands contain over 430 stems/ha (175 stems/acre) 13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 in) d.b.h. In old-growth, mixed stands with Shumard oak, there are total volumes of as much as 420 m³/ha (30,000 fbm/acre). Rooting Habit- No information is currently available. Reaction to Competition- Shumard oak is classed as intolerant of shade and needs open areas as well as adequate moisture to become established; such openings are easily invaded by competing annuals that inhibit oak establishment. It is reported, however, that at maturity Shumard oak retards the growth of competing understory vegetation apparently by an allelopathic effect (3). Shumard oak reproduction shows some tolerance to complete inundation, a requisite for survival on bottom-land sites. Conditions other than species-site relationships are important in determining the regeneration potential and succession of the species in bottom-land hardwood situations. Water is apparently most likely to become the limiting factor on sites that are consistently flooded for fairly long periods of time during the growing season, such as true swamps, deep sloughs, and backwater areas. Shumard oak is one of the prominent oaks in oak-hickory regions but does not act as a dominant in the extensive range of the oak-hickory association. Therefore, the place of Shumard oak in the ecological succession is not clearly defined. It is probably not a true climax tree in most oak-hick communities where it is found. Damaging Agents- This species is susceptible to wilts and leaf diseases. Oak leaf blister (Taphrina caerulescens) is common in certain years. Oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) has killed Shumard oak in Missouri. The most common wood-rotting fungi attacking this oak are Fomes spp., Polyporus spp., and Stereum spp. No insects are specifically associated with Shumard oak, but many insects attack southern oaks, probably including Shumard. Insect defoliators are June beetles (Phyllophaga spp.), orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), cankerworms (Alsophila pometaria and Paleacrita vernata), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), yellownecked caterpillar (Datana ministra), variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), and the redhumped oakworm (Symmerista canicosta) (7). The borers that attack healthy trees are red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), in cambium and other sapwood; carpenterworms (Prionoxystus spp.), in heart and sapwood; and the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus), in sapwood. Those attacking weakened trees include twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus), in cambium; and the tilehorned prionus (Prionus imbricornis), in roots. Dying trees are attacked by the oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus). The golden oak scale (Asterolecanium variolosum) kills reproduction and tops in older trees. The gouty oak gall (Callirhytis quercuspunctata) and horned oak gall (C. cornigera) injure small limbs, while the basswood leafminer (Baliosus nervosus) attacks the leaves (7). As in many oaks, the nut is attacked by acorn weevils in the genus Curculio. A reliable method of sorting weeviled acorns from sound ones is by color of the cup scar on the nut; a bright, light tan indicates a good acorn, a dull brown, a bad one.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Shumard Oak,quercus,shumardii,hardwood,14,0
"Shumard oak grows best in rich sites of the southern forests that have moist, well-drained loamy soils found on terraces, colluvial sites, and adjacent bluffs associated with large and small streams. It is found in hammocks of the Coastal Plain, but rarely on first-bottom sites. It appears to be tolerant of sites with high pH and associated nutrient deficiencies. In trial plantings, Shumard oak has grown well on alluvium with a pH near 7.5.

"Where planted in pure stands in Hawaii, silk-oak maintains its purity with little woody competition. In naturalized stands, it grows in association with many other tree species including the native koa (Acacia koa), 'ohi 'a (Metrosideros collina), and introduced species such as tropical ash (Fraxinus uhdei), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), molucca albizzia (Albizia falcataria), black-wattle (Acacia decurrens), Christmas-berry (Schinus terebinthifolius), and guava (Psidium guajava).",Associated Forest Cover,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,1,0
"In Hawaii, silk-oak has been planted extensively in both wet and dry locations on all islands from near sea level to more than 900 in (3,000 ft) elevation (9). The mean temperature ranges from 10° to 26° C (50° to 78° F) within this elevational range, with extremes of 4° and 35° C (40° and 95° F). Silk-oak, for many years, was thought to be best suited for planting in and areas because of its success as a seedling and sapling in such areas. Later it became apparent that frequent severe moisture stress in the dry areas (less than 760 mm [30 in] annual rainfall) caused disease susceptibility resulting in dieback as the trees became older. Natural reproduction, however, was sometimes excellent in these dry locations. The largest silk-oak trees in Hawaii grow in 3050 min (120 in) winter maximum or evenly distributed annual rainfall at 610 m (2,000 ft) elevation, but the most prolific natural reproduction coupled with excellent growth occurs in 1780 to 2400 min (70 to 95 in) evenly distributed annual rainfall at 460 to 670 in (1,500 to 2,000 ft) elevation. Elsewhere than Hawaii, silk-oak is reported to be capable of withstanding occasional light frosts but must be considered frost-tender (16). It is also reported elsewhere to be fairly hardy to drought but tends to die back on droughty sites at 15 to 20 years of age (2).",Climate,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,2,0
No studies of the genetics of the species have been reported (2). A test of 11 different genera in Brazil showed 1-year-old silk-oak seedlings to be the most uniform in height growth (Silva and Reichmann 1975 cited in 2).,Genetics,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,7,0
"Silk-oak is native to coastal eastern Australia from the Clarence River, New South Wales, to Maryborough, Queensland, and is now naturalized in Hawaii and southern Florida (3,16). It was introduced into Hawaii about 1880 and is found on all islands where it reproduces prolifically in certain leeward grassland locations. Although a nongregarious tree in its native habitat, it grows well in pure plantations in Hawaii (18). It is common as an ornamental in Hawaii, Florida, California, and Puerto Rico (5). Because of its prolific reproduction, it has been classed a noxious weed on ranchland in Hawaii (9). In the tropical highlands of India, where it has also been extensively planted, it is often an undesirable escapee from cultivation (13).",Native Range,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,11,0
"Although it is most commonly grown in nurseries and planted, silk-oak regenerates naturally at the edges of plantations, in openings within plantations, and under open stands of other species. It does not regenerate directly underneath itself either in closed stands or under open-grown trees. Natural regeneration is reported from India, Tanzania, and Queensland, Australia (at the edges of plantations), as well as from Hawaii (6,9,11,12,14,16,18). Flowering and Fruiting- In Hawaii, silk-oak flowers from March through October, with the peak of flowering usually in June. The perfect yellowish orange, showy flowers are borne on 8- to 18-cm (3 to 7-in) long racemes that occur in panicles of one to several branches (3). Trees usually begin to flower at about 10 years. The fruit, a podlike follicle, 20 mm (0.8 in) in diameter, is slightly flattened and has a long-curved style. The hard dark-brown to black follicle splits open in late fall to release the one or two seeds it contains but remains on the tree up to 1 year after opening. Trees near San Jose in California have been observed to flower, fruit, and seed at times similar to those in Hawaii. Seed Production and Dissemination- Silk-oak is a prolific seeder. Seeds are about 10 mm (0.4 in) long, flattened, and surrounded by a membranous wing. There are reported to be 64,000 to 154,000 seeds per kilogram (29,000 to 70,000/lb). Because of their relatively large wing, the lightweight seeds are widely disseminated by wind. Possibly because seedfall coincides with the onset of winter rains in dry leeward rangeland in Hawaii, regeneration is most prolific on these sites. The seeds, if kept at 10 percent or less moisture content, can be stored for as long as 2 years at -7° to 3° C (20° to 38° F) with little loss in germinability. Germination of fresh, unstratified seeds requires about 20 days. Stratification at 3° C (38° F) for 30 days, or a 48-hour water soak, substantially increases germinative capacity of seeds that have been stored (19). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Seedlings are grown in flats or containers in nurseries. Methods vary among the countries where silkoak is grown. In some countries 4- to 6-week-old wildings are lifted and potted and later replanted (2). Elsewhere plants are grown to 45-cm (18-in) heights in large baskets so that they can compete when outplanted (12). In Hawaii, seedlings in individual containers can be grown to a plantable size of 20 cm (8 in) height and 4 mm (0. 16 in) caliper in 12 to 14 weeks. Vegetative Reproduction- Silk-oak coppices when cut. After being damaged by fire, a 5-year-old stand in Karnataka State, India, was cut. One year later, 93 percent of the stumps had coppiced. After 2 years 72 percent of the stumps still retained the coppice shoots, which by then averaged 4 m (13 ft) in height (1). As far as is known, vegetative propagation has not been practiced with the species.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- In Hawaii, the tree usually produces a straight, erect stem even when open-grown (15). Where subjected to drought stress sufficiently severe to cause dieback, it forms forks and multiple leaders. On good sites (500 m; 1,600 ft altitude; 2030 mm.; 80 in annual rainfall), dominant trees planted at spacing of 3 by 3 m (10 by 10 ft) can be expected to be 8 to 9 m (25 to 30 ft) tall in 5 years, 15 m (48 ft) in 10 years, and 20 m (65 ft) or more in 20 years (11). Mean annual increment of dominants on 21 different sites in Uganda, for trees 2 to 20 years in age, ranged from 1.3 to 3.3 cm (0.5 to 1.3 in) in diameter and from 0.5 to 3.4 m (1.7 to 11.2 ft) in height (4). This indicates that the tree is fast growing as a sapling and pole. Many plots have been measured in 32- to 48-yearold silk-oak plantations in Hawaii (11). All the plantations had been planted at 3 by 3 m (10 by 10 ft) and left untended since planting. Average d.b.h. of dominant and codominant trees at 44 years in four of the plots was 46 cm (18 in), and the average total height was 32 m (105 ft). The most outstanding stand, at 36 years, yielded a mean annual increment of 17.5 m/ha (1,250 fbm/acre) (11). Typically, merchantable trees in these untended stands were 36 to 46 cm (14 to 18 in) d.b.h. with 9 to 11 m (30 to 36 ft) of branch-free stem. In India, trees reach 50 cm (20 in) diameter in 30 years when grown at an initial spacing of 3 by 4 m (10 by 13 ft) and thinned once at about 5 years, and again later if needed to maintain growth rate. Such stands yield about 140 m³/ha (2,000 ft³/acre) with another 70 m³/ha (1,000 ft³/acre) from thinnings (13). One 14-year-old plantation had a mean diameter of 27 cm (11 in) and height of 19 in (61 ft) and yielded 217 m³/ha (3,100 ft³/acre) (13). Another author in India suggests that silk-oak at 10 to 15 years and 1,000 stems per hectare (370/acre) yields 10 to 12 m³/ha (143 to 172 ft³/acre) (10). In the western Himalayas, 6-yearold silk-oak had outgrown 45 other species, including such fast growers as Eucalyptus globulus, Populus x euroamericana, and Albizia lebbek (17). Rooting Habit- Silk-oak does not develop a strong taproot and roots shallowly on sites that lack moisture stress (16). On droughty sites it roots throughout the soil profile to depths of about 2 in (6 ft). Reaction to Competition- Silk-oak is classed as very intolerant of shade. In Australia, seedlings do not survive beneath closed pure stands of the species because of some substance toxic to them that is produced by or associated with roots of the trees (18). This substance is specific to silk-oak seedlings, causing rapid chlorosis, blackening, and death of seedlings soon after they emerge and begin to grow. Consequently, the tree is nongregarious in its natural habitat. The toxic substance has not been investigated in Hawaii, but it has been observed that reproduction is lacking within dense stands or directly beneath individual trees. In Hawaii, silk-oak has been planted in mixture with numerous other species. Two of the species it dominates when in mixture are melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia) and horsetail casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia). Three that grow well in mixture with it are Australian toon (Toona ciliata var. australis), tropical ash, and koa. Three that dominate silk-oak are Norfolk-Island-pine (Araucaria heterophylla), saligna eucalyptus (Eucalyptus saligna), and robusta eucalyptus (E. robusta). In Brazil, several spacing studies indicated that at 2 years, a spacing of 1 by 3 in (3 by 10 ft) resulted in the best height growth, but at 6 years, 2 by 2 in (6 by 6 ft) was best, with thinning planned at age 10 or 15 (Viega 1958 as cited in 2). In Brazil, an attempt is made to maintain a basal area of 49 to 61 m²/ha (213 to 265 ft²/acre) throughout the life of the stand. In Hawaii, silk-oak has always been planted at a spacing of 3 by 3 in (10 by 10 ft) and left untended. In Uganda experiments, a number of thinnings were made at various ages, but with little apparent effect on mean annual diameter increment (4). Damaging Agents- The oleander pit scale, Asterolecanium pustulans Cockerell, was so damaging in Puerto Rico that further planting of the species was discouraged (7). Amphichaeta grevilleae is a serious leaf spot and defoliating disease in India where it kills young plants (14). Also in India, a serious dieback is caused by a fungus, Corticium salmonicolor (8). No serious primary insects or diseases of the species have been noted in Hawaii, although severe dieback, believed caused by drought, is common on most droughty sites.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,14,0
"Silk-oak is tolerant of a wide range of soils if they are well drained (16). It will grow on neutral to strongly acid soils but does best on those that are slightly acid (2,12). In Hawaii, good growth is achieved on soils of a wide range of orders. Silk-oak grows well on Histosols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols. The majority of the best stands are on Dystrandepts and Tropofolists developed on gentle to moderate slopes of basalt lava rock or ash.",Soils and Topography,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,15,0
"Grevillea robusta is a popular ornamental because of its fernlike foliage even in areas where it does not flower abundantly, such as California and Florida north of Miami. In more tropical climates its showy flowers cause it to be widely used. It has been planted extensively in India and Sri Lanka as shade for tea, and in Hawaii, India, and Brazil to some extent as shade for coffee (2,12,14,16). It is frequently used as a windbreak, although opinions differ as to its wind firmness and branch-shedding tendencies (2). Silk-oak is an important honey tree in India where it is also regarded as a good fuelwood producer (13). The tree produces an attractively figured, easily worked wood, which was once a leading face veneer in world trade, where it was marketed as ""lacewood."" The wood contains an allergen that causes dermatitis for many people (15).",Special Uses,Silk-Oak,grevillea,robusta,hardwood,16,0
"Throughout its range, singleleaf pinyon is the major component of the forest cover type Pinyon-Juniper (Society of American Foresters Type 239) (6). Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) is present in varying amounts in most singleleaf pinyon stands. Pinyon is usually the dominant species, but juniper tends to be dominant along the northern geographical limit of pinyon and near the lower elevational limit of pinyon in many areas. Utah juniper is absent from some pinyon stands in western and southern Nevada and from most pinyon stands in southern California. California juniper (J. californica) replaces Utah juniper in some southern California pinyon woodlands (9). Curlleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) is associated with singleleaf pinyon in many areas, particularly near the upper elevational limit of pinyon. In the Sierra Nevada, singleleaf pinyon can be found growing with Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Singleleaf pinyon has been found growing with bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata var. longaeva) in the White Mountains of California (21), on several mountain ranges in Nevada, and in the San Francisco Mountains of southwestern Utah (14). There is a great diversity of undergrowth vegetation associated with singleleaf pinyon woodlands, and coverages vary with site quality and successional stage. Early successional stages following fire or tree harvesting are often dominated by several weedy annuals: coyote tobacco (Nicotiana attenuata), ground smoke (Gayophytum ramosissimum), stickseed (Lappula redowskii) and root sprouting shrubs: rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), ephedra (Ephedra spp.), snowberry (Symphoricarpos spp.), and desert peach (Prunus andersonii) (3). The invasion of Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) on disturbed pinyon sites can create a fire disclimax community that inhibits shrub and subsequent tree establishment. Other shrubs that often establish from soil seed reserves or immigrate rapidly to disturbed sites include mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata var. vaseyana), basin big sagebrush (A. tridentata var. tridentata), Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata var. wyomingensis), low sagebrush (A. arbuscula), black sagebrush (A. nova), sulfur eriogonum (Eriogonum umbellatum), and antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata). Associated grasses include Sandberg blue grass (Poa sandbergii), bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), Nevada bluegrass (Poa nevadensis), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), bearded bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), Great Basin wildrye (Elymus cinereus), and needle-and-thread grass (Stipa comata) (24). All perennial understory species decline during stand development.",Associated Forest Cover,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,1,1
"Singleleaf pinyon grows under more xeric conditions than any other pine in the United States. Its climate is similar to that of pinyon (Pinus edulis), but during the growing season, relative humidity and precipitation are even lower and potential evapotranspiration is greater. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 200 mm. (8 in) to about 460 mm (18 in) but precipitation varies widely from year to year. Most of the precipitation occurs during the winter months (December to April), usually as snow. Mean annual temperature is about 10° C (50° F). The mean maximum temperature in July, the hottest month, is about 30° C (86° F). The mean minimum temperature in January, the coldest month, is about -6° C (21° F). Tree growth usually starts in April and usually ceases in September or October. During most of this time, the trees depend on soil moisture stored by winter precipitation.",Climate,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,2,1
"The wide geographic and elevational ranges of singleleaf pinyon suggest a great deal of genetic variation. Difference in growth form, foliage color, and cone production among trees growing on identical sites are commonly observed. Little research has been done, however, on the genetics of intraspecific variation of singleleaf pinyon. Singleleaf pinyon hybridizes with Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) in Utah and Arizona where the ranges of the two species overlap (12), and with Parry pinyon (P. quadrifolia) in southern California and Baja California (13).",Genetics,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,7,1
"Singleleaf pinyon is the predominant tree species in the Great Basin. It dominates extensive areas in the dry mountain ranges of Nevada, southern and eastern California, and western Utah. Some stands are in Baja California, northwestern Arizona, and southeastern Idaho. - The native range of singleleaf pinyon.",Native Range,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Singleleaf pinyon is monoecious and requires two seasons between flowering and seed ripening. Male and female strobili emerge from buds in late spring or early summer. The staminate cones usually begin to shed pollen by mid-June when the young ovulate cones are receptive to pollination. Growth and development of the cones are slow during the first growing season. By September the cones are about one-fourth their mature length. Fertilization occurs the following spring, about 1 year after pollination. The cones grow rapidly during the second growing season. Three to four cones may mature on each branchlet. As the cones mature in early September they turn from green to brown. Cone-opening may last from September to early November depending on environmental conditions and elevation. Mature cones range in length from 3.7 to 8.3 cm (1.5 to 3.3 in) and average 5.5 cm (2.2 in). The number of sound seeds per cone varies from 2 to 60 with an average of 20. The number of seeds per kilogram ranges from 1,200 to 3,400 (540 to 1,540 seeds/lb), with an average of 2,000 seeds per kilogram (900/lb). The viability of fresh seeds is high, but shelf life is short. The germination of some seed lots decreased from 90 percent before storage to 10 percent after 6 months of cold storage. Because the average moisture content of freshly collected seeds is 30 percent (wet weight basis), seeds should be dried before storing. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production by singleleaf pinyon is highly variable. It varies from tree to tree, from year to year, and from place to place. The interval between good seed crops in any particular area varies from 3 to 7 years, yet good seed crops occur somewhere in the Great Basin woodlands nearly every year. Generally, singleleaf pinyon trees do not begin bearing cones before they are 35 years old and do not begin producing good seed crops earlier than 100 years. A productive tree yields about 5 kg (11 lb) of seeds in a good year, but some trees never yield good crops. The heavy wingless seeds are not adapted to wind dispersal but tend to fall to the duff under the parent tree. The seeds are disseminated locally by rodents and over distances by birds. These animals consume most of the seed but leave some to germinate in place or in caches, especially when seed production is above average. Seedling Development- Pinyon depends upon a standing crop of seedlings for species perpetuation. Seedlings require a nurse crop; thus, most seedlings are found under shrubs in mid succession and under the tree crown in late succession (4). Germination is epigeal. Although pinyon seedlings germinate in the open, few survive without some degree of protection from direct solar radiation. Top growth during the seedling stage is extremely slow. Seedling height growth usually is less than 2.5 cm (1.0 in) per year and diameter growth usually is less than 0.3 mm (0.012 in) per year. Root growth, however, is quite rapid. The thick taproot can reach 15 cm (6 in) in 10 days after germination. Seedlings growing under low shrubs usually have greater diameter growth and less height growth than those under tree canopies. Seedlings maintain a more favorable water status and have greater drought avoidance than the shrub nurse plant (2). This phenomena facilitates seedling survival and tree encroachment into adjacent shrub communities. Vegetative Reproduction- Single leaf pinyon does not reproduce naturally by vegetative means.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Singleleaf pinyon is one of the slowest growing conifers. It usually requires about 60 years to attain a height of 2 m (6.6 ft). Average annual height growth of immature dominants is about 5 cm (2 in). Height growth rates vary considerably among individual trees, even among those on identical sites. Heights of mature dominants range from about 6 in to 12 m (20 to 40 ft), depending on site quality and genotype (17). One pinyon 14 m (46 ft) tall has been reported (19). Because singleleaf pinyon tends to have large branches or multiple stems at breast height, diameter and basal area measurements are taken more conveniently near ground level, usually at 15 cm (6 in) above the ground (stump height). Diameter growth rates are greatly influenced by competition for severely limited water supplies. Average annual diameter growth of dominant trees is 1 to 5 mm (0.04 to 0.20 in). The average dominant tree takes about 150 years to reach a stump height diameter of 30 cm (12 in). There is no definite age of culmination of diameter growth; pinyon trees in strongly dominant positions can maintain essentially constant diameter growth rates for more than 200 years. Reductions in diameter growth rates are caused by increasing competition as stands develop, rather than by tree age (17). Average annual basal area growth of fully stocked stands is about 0.25 m²/ha (1.1 ft²/acre) on typical sites, as low as 0.09 m²/ha (0.4 ft²/acre) on poor sites, and as high as 0.55 m²/ha (2.4 ft²/acre) on good sites. Average annual above-ground biomass accumulation rates of fully stocked stands varies from about 0.2 to about 2.2 t/ha (0.1 to 1.0 ton/acre), depending on site quality. On average sites it is about 0.9 t/ha (0.4 ton/acre) (17). Total above-ground biomass averages 150 t/ha (67 ton/acre) of which 60 percent is in the tree and 40 percent is in the forest floor. Singleleaf pinyon trees more than 300 years old are fairly common on poor sites but rare on good sites. It appears that all the better sites were either burned in the past 300 years or have been cut over in the past century or so. The poorer sites are virtually fireproof because their sparse vegetation will not carry fire, and these sites were not cut because of the small size and poor form of their trees. The maximum life-span of singleleaf pinyon is probably greater than 600 years. A healthy tree 433 years old and 100 cm (40 in) diameter at stump height was found in the Sweetwater Mountains in east-central California (18). Trees slightly older than 600 years have been reported in the Toiyabe Range in central Nevada and in the Egan Range in eastern Nevada. Rooting Habit- Little information is available on the rooting habit of pinyon. A few excavated trees indicate root systems are comprised of a short, stunted taproot, a fibrous ""feeder"" root system under the tree crown, and an extensive lateral root system that extends for at least three times tree height in all directions. Complete crown closure is rare in most stands, but where the stands are well developed the soils are usually completely occupied by tree roots resulting in suppression of the understory vegetation. Reaction to Competition- Although pinyon is intolerant of shade, water rather than light is usually the limiting factor in survival and growth. The competition for available soil moisture among trees is so intense that younger trees are usually suppressed and some eventually die. Although older trees usually survive, growth rates are greatly reduced. Suppressed trees may resume normal growth rates when released from severe moisture stress (17). Light competition does not appear to be a factor because overstory foliage is rarely dense enough to reduce light intensities below tolerance levels. Damaging Agents- Susceptibility to fire depends on the stage of development of the pinyon stand. In young stands, enough shrubby and herbaceous vegetation often exists to carry fire over extensive areas. As the stand develops, understory vegetation becomes too sparse to carry fire, and the trees generally are too widely spaced to carry a crown fire except with the aid of extremely high winds (1). Thus, fire is ordinarily confined to younger stands and to a few individual lightning-struck trees in older stands. Pinyon ips (Ips confusus) is endemic over the range of singleleaf pinyon. It occasionally attacks and kills trees weakened by other agents but usually causes little damage (8). Minor epidemics can occur in areas where uprooted trees or slash accumulation permit the population to build up and successfully attack healthy trees. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) attacks singleleaf pinyon on rare occasions. Pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus) weakens trees by repeated feeding, which makes them more vulnerable to attack by Ips confusus and may kill small trees directly. The pinyon sawfly (Neodiprion edulicolus), a defoliator, reduces tree vigor and renders small trees unfit as Christmas trees (15). Pinyon foliage also is attacked by a number of less damaging insects including an aphid (Pineus coloradensis), a beetle (Glyptoscelis aridis), a scale (Matsucoccus monophyllae), a stinkbug (Dendrocoris pini), and a sawfly (Zadiprion rohweri) (8). Singleleaf pinyon nut production is sporadic, varying considerably from place to place and from year to year. Weather variations are partially responsible, but cone insects probably reduce nut production substantially. The most damaging cone insects are two moth species (Eucosma bobana and Dioryctria albovittella) and the singleleaf pinyon cone beetle (Conophthorus monophyllae) (7,11). Although singleleaf pinyon is attacked by a number of diseases, only three are known to cause serious injury. Pinyon dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium divaricatum) is a widespread parasite found on both singleleaf and Colorado pinyon; it causes extensive damage (10). It rarely kills trees directly but renders them more susceptible to insect attack. Pinyon blister rust (Cronartium occidentale) occurs extensively on Ribes spp. in most western states but attacks singleleaf and Colorado pinyon only in localized areas (22). It occasionally kills small trees but rarely becomes epidemic. A root disease (Verticicladiella wageneri) kills singleleaf pinyon in a few localized areas, notably in the San Bernardino Mountains of California (20,25). It spreads by root contact and is confined to the xylem in the roots and lower trunk.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,14,1
"Singleleaf pinyon grows on pediments, slopes, and ridges. It grows best on coarse textured, well drained Mollisols and is rarely found on valley floors. Soils are both residual and alluvial and are derived from granite, rhyolite, andesite, limestone, and a variety of other parent materials. Soil depth and age are highly variable. Surface soil pH usually is between 6.0 and 8.0. Trees impact soils by changing soil nutrient distribution both laterally and vertically in the soil profile and concentrating nutrients under the crowns (5). The elevational range of singleleaf pinyon is usually between 1000 m (3,280 ft) and 2800 m (9,200 ft), depending on local conditions. In the high desert of the Great Basin, the lower limit is somewhat above the elevation of the adjacent valleys, varying from about 1520 m to 2130 m (5,000 to 7,000 ft). In Baja California and parts of California, singleleaf pinyon can be found below 1000 m (3,280 ft) (9). The upper elevational limit varies with local climate and presence of competing tree species. Singleleaf pinyon has been reported at 3050 m (10,000 ft) in the White Mountains of California (21).",Soils and Topography,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,15,1
"Because of its small size and lack of self-pruning, singleleaf pinyon is not suitable for lumber, but it is used extensively for firewood. Because most singleleaf pinyon above-ground biomass and nutrient capital is in the slash (less than 7.6 cm, -1 in, in dia.) nutrient loss from fuelwood removal is not a significant nutrient drain on the site (23). Pinyon makes a desirable Christmas tree because of its fragrance and strong branches. Pinyon nuts were a staple in the diet of the Indians before white settlement and are still harvested extensively. At present, the greatest values of the pinyon-juniper woodlands are the shelter and forage they provide numerous species of wildlife. As the demand for energy increases, the highest use will shift toward fuel production.",Special Uses,Singleleaf Pinyon,pinus,monophylla,conifer,16,1
"Sitka spruce is commonly associated with western hemlock throughout most of its range. Toward the south, other conifer associates include Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), western white pine (Pinus monticola), and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). Shore pine (P. contorta var. contorta) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata) are also associates that extend into southeast Alaska. Toward the north, conifer associates also include Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa)-trees that are usually found only at higher elevations toward the south. In central and northern British Columbia and Alaska, however, these species are found with Sitka spruce from sea level to timberline. White spruce (Picea glauca) is also associated with Sitka spruce in Alaska, and hybrids occur. The most important hardwood associates are red alder and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) in the south and red alder and Sitka alder toward the north. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) is an associate throughout the range. Stands stocked with at least 80 percent Sitka spruce are identified as the forest cover type Sitka Spruce (Society of American Foresters Type 223) (6).

Pure stands usually occur in early successional situations and as tidewater stands influenced by salt spray. The most extensive pure stands are found on the Kodiak-Afognak Archipelago at the extreme west extension of the range. Sitka spruce is the only conifer present on this group of islands. A relatively recent invader there, spruce is expanding its range to the southwest, invading a tundra complex at the rate of about 1.6 km (1 mi) per century (14). In Oregon and Washington, common understory species associated with Sitka spruce include swordfern (Polystichum munitum), Oregon oxalis (Oxalis oregana), false lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum dilatatum), western springbeauty (Montia sibirica), three-leaved coolwort (Tiarella trifoliata), evergreen violet (Viola sempervirens), stream violet (V. glabella), Smith fairybells (Disporum smithii), red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium), and rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea). On drier sites, salal (Gaultheria shallon), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), and evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum) are common. On wetter forest sites, the previously mentioned species are found, along with devilsclub (Oplopanax horridum), ladyfern (Athyrium filix-femina), deerfern (Blechnum spicant), mountain woodfern (Dryopteris austriaca), and Pacific red elder (Sambucus callicarpa) (11). In Alaska, the more common understory plants include devilsclub, skunkcabbage (Lysichitum americanum), ovalleaf huckleberry (Vaccinium ovalifolium), red huckleberry, Alaska blueberry (V. alaskaense), rustyleaf menziesia, salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis), five-leaf bramble (R. pedatus), thimbleberry (R. parviflorus), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), stink currant (Ribes bracteosum), and trailing black currant (R. laxiflorum) (32).

"In addition to the clinal latitudinal difference in growth rate, cone characteristics such as size, length-to-width ratio, angle of sterigma, and phylotaxy also vary with latitude (4). Variation in wood characteristics has been reported by provenance, region, site, and individual trees. Although no comprehensive heritability studies have been completed, Sitka spruce shows considerable variation in wood density, tracheid length, and grain angle. Improvement in these characteristics through breeding appears feasible. Selection for vigor tends to favor trees of lower-than-average specific gravity but has no effect on tracheid length (15). Provenance studies show that- at a given planting site- northern, inland, and high-elevation sources are the first and the most variable in breaking dormancy. Dormancy appears to be influenced by photoperiod, and northern provenances are the first to enter dormancy. Total seasonal height growth is positively correlated with the time interval between flushing and dormancy. When moved north, introduced southern sources make better height growth, but they may be subject to frost damage if moved too far or planted on exposed sites. Once dormant, Sitka spruce is able to endure very low temperatures without damage. Sitka spruce from northern provenances may be more resistant to freezing than those from southern provenances. Dormant leaves from a Bellingham, WA, source withstood temperatures to -30° C (-22° F), whereas a Juneau, AK, source withstood temperatures to -40° C (-40° F). Twigs of the two sources withstood temperatures to -40° C and -60° C (-40° F and -76° F), respectively (27). Only limited data are available on genetic variation between individual trees. Assessment of first-year characteristics of progeny from a diallel cross among six trees showed that characters affecting tree form were inherited in a predominantly additive fashion; characters reflecting tree vigor were under ""additive, dominance, and maternal control"" (28). Self-pollinated progeny showed growth depression caused by inbreeding (28).",Genetics,Sitka Spruce,picea,sitchensis,conifer,7,1

"Sitka spruce grows in a narrow strip along the north Pacific coast from latitude 61° N. in southcentral Alaska to 39° N. in northern California. The most extensive portion of the range in both width and elevation is in southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia, where the east-west range extends for about 210 km (130 mi) to include a narrow mainland strip and the many islands of the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska and the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia (24). North and west of southeast Alaska, along the Gulf of Alaska to Prince William Sound, the range is restricted by steep mountains and piedmont glaciers edging the sea. Within Prince William Sound, the range again widens to about 105 km (65 mi) to include many offshore islands. Westward, the range again narrows. It extends across Cook Inlet to Cape Kubugakli and across Shelikof Strait to the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago where the range continues to advance to the southwest. In southern British Columbia, the range includes a narrow mainland strip and offshore islands, but the best development occurs on the northern tip and west side of Vancouver Island. On the east side of Vancouver Island and on the mainland south to Washington, the range tends to be restricted to sea-facing slopes and valley bottoms. In Washington, the range includes a narrow mainland strip along the Strait of Georgia, around Puget Sound, up valleys to the east, and on the Olympic Peninsula. On the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, the range broadens to include the extensive coastal plain and seaward mountain slopes. It narrows southward along the Washington and Oregon coast but extends inland for several kilometers along the major rivers.

"Biochemical variation between populations of Sitka spruce from various parts of its natural range has been studied for polyphenols, isoenzymes, and terpenoids. Differences in polyphenol concentrations have been found between different origins, and a high degree of variation in monoterpene concentrations has been shown between trees in stands and by stand origin. Polyphenol, isoenzyme, and terpenoid analyses have been used in studying the introgression between Sitka spruce and white spruce (9). Variation is known to occur within the cell nucleus. The length of the haploid complement and the nuclear volume increase with latitude of seed origin. Seeds from northern sources have more DNA per cell than those from southern provenances. Super-numerary (B) chromosomes have been foundin seeds from eight provenances (15). Genetic tree improvement programs are progressing in Britain and in Denmark.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Individual Sitka spruce may occasionally produce cones before 20 years of age, but cone bearing in stands usually does not begin until ages 20 to 40 (24). Sitka spruce is monoecious; female strobili (cones) are usually produced at the ends of primary branches near tops of trees; male strobili are usually produced at the ends of secondary branches lower in trees. Both may be on the same branch. Reproductive buds are initiated in early summer of the year preceding pollination and seed ripening, and heavy cone crops have been explained in terms of early summer drought the preceding year. Cones ripen in the year they were pollinated. Pollen is shed from the last week in April in the southern portion of the natural range through early June in the extreme northwest part of the range. Time of flowering is mainly related to temperature. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds of Sitka spruce are small, averaging 463,000/kg (210,000/lb) (26). Seeds ripen in southeast Alaska during late August or early September, and dispersal usually begins in October. Cones open during dry weather, release seed, and reclose during wet weather. One study showed that 73 percent of the seed was released within 6 weeks of the first dispersal date, and the remainder was released over 1 year (15). Good crops occur at 3- to 5-year intervals in the southern part of the range and at 5- to 8-year intervals in Alaska. Cone and seed production in seed orchards can be increased by treating trees with gibberellin (31). Dispersal distance depends on several factors, including height and location of the seed source, local topography, and wind conditions. Reported dispersal distances range from 0.8 km (0.5 mi) when a seed source was on high ground, to 30 m (100 ft) when seed was released from the edge of a clearcut area (15). Seedling Development- Under natural conditions, seed germinates on almost any seedbed, but survival may be low. Germination is epigeal (26). A mineral soil or mixed mineral and organic soil seedbed is usually considered best for germination, especially under light shade, as long as drainage is adequate and the soil provides sufficient nutrients for tree growth. Fine-textured soils combined with a high water table are suitable for germination but may be unsuitable for seedling establishment because of frost heaving. Coarse-textured mineral soils in unshaded conditions may dry out excessively but may improve after invasion by hair mosses that bind the soil surface and provide shade. Organic seedbeds are suitable in shade but are unsuitable in the open if subject to severe moisture fluctuations. On alluvial sites having high water tables and subject to frequent flooding, where competition from brush is severe, rotten wood may be the only suitable seedbed. Vegetative Reproduction- Asexual reproduction by layering occurs under natural conditions and in plantations, but layering is most likely to occur on very moist sites at the edges of bogs or near timberline. Asexual propagation can be done by air-layering or rooting of stem cuttings. Clones differ in their ability to root or graft, and clones that graft easily do not necessarily root easily and vice versa. Cuttings from shoots of the current year root more easily than cuttings from older branches (15).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sitka Spruce,picea,sitchensis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Height growth is slow for the first few years but increases rapidly thereafter. On average sites in southeast Alaska, trees can be expected to reach about 27 m (90 ft) in height within 50 years after attaining breast height (7). Average site index at elevations near sea level varies inversely with latitude, declining from 48 m (158 ft) at base age 100 years in Lincoln County, OR, to 33 m (108 ft) in southeast Alaska, at the rate of about 1 m (3 ft) per degree of latitude (8). Observations within the natural range of spruce show that growth rate also declines with increasing elevation. Height growth of Sitka spruce and western hemlock are nearly equal during the period of most rapid growth, but spruce grows more rapidly in diameter. Consequently, thinning from below tends to favor spruce. Spruce continues to maintain height growth longer than hemlock and lives longer. Few hemlock live more than 500 years; Sitka spruce may live to 700 or 800 years. Very old spruces eventually assume a dominant position in old-growth hemlock-spruce stands. Sitka spruce trees often attain great size. In Alaska, mature trees near sea level may exceed 61 m (200 ft) in height and 3 m (10 ft) in d.b.h. In Oregon, a tree 87 m (286 ft) tall was reported (24). The largest tree on record is located near Seaside, OR. It is 5.1 m (16.7 ft) in d.b.h. and 65.8 m (216 ft) tall and has a crown spread of 28 m (93 ft) (17). Stands in which Sitka spruce is a major component tend to be dense, and yields are high (21,30). Stand volumes can be impressive. One plot in a 147-year-old hemlock-spruce stand in coastal Oregon contained, on an area basis, 188 spruce and 32 hemlock/ha (76 spruce and 13 hemlock/acre). Total volume was 2380 m³/ha (34,000 ft³/acre). Spruce averaged 64 m (210 ft) in height and 86 cm (34 in) in d.b.h., and hemlock averaged 44 m (144 ft) in height and 46 cm (18 in) in d.b.h (24). Rooting Habit- Roots will grow where moisture, fertility, aeration, and mechanical soil properties are favorable. Consequently, there is great variability in root form-from flat platelike roots to deep, narrow-spreading roots (12). Where soils are shallow, soil temperature and fertility low, and water tables high, shallow rooting is by far the most common form. Deeper rooting does occur, however, where soils have good drainage and depth to water table. Rooting to depths of 2 m (6 ft) has been reported (5). Sitka spruce commonly produces long lateral roots with few branches and rapid elongation (20). Annual elongation rates of 42 to 167 cm (16 to 66 in) have been reported (3). Lateral roots up to 23 m (75 ft) in length have been observed in Alaska (15). Root grafting occurs between roots of the same tree and between adjacent trees. It is fairly common to find living stumps sustained by root grafts from adjacent trees. Adventitious roots develop on trees growing along streams where alluvium is deposited by periodic flooding. Roots are vulnerable, however, to compaction and lack of aeration. Spruce are frequently killed by permanent flooding caused by beavers, and often valuable ornamental and roadside trees are killed when landfill is deposited around them. Containerized nursery stock has been successfully inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungi, Laccaria laccata and Cenococcum geophilum (29). Reaction to Competition- Sitka spruce is more tolerant of shade than Douglas-fir but less tolerant than hemlock. Depending on latitude, Sitka spruce has been described as being in the tolerant and intermediate shade-tolerant classes. Overall, it probably can most accurately be classed as tolerant of shade. Since reproduction under mixed stands is predominantly hemlock, there is a tendency for this more tolerant species to eventually dominate the site. Few climax stands proceed to pure hemlock, however; in time, small openings, usually caused by blowdowns, develop, allowing reproduction of spruce. The combination of greater stature, greater longevity, and occasional stand disturbance is enough to assure a scattering of spruce in the overstory of most climax hemlock-spruce stands. Sitka spruce is one of the few conifers that develop epicormic branches along the stem. Production of these sprouts is related to light intensity, and roadside trees often develop dense new foliage from base to crown. Thinning stimulates epicormic branching and could decrease the quality of the wood, although this is not a problem in production of pulp or dimension lumber. In deep shade, lower limbs soon die, decay, and break off, but the resinous branch stubs remain for many years. Damaging Agents- Blowdown is probably the most serious damaging agent of Sitka spruce, but the species is attacked by a number of pests-insects, disease organisms, and animals. In general, problems tend to be more severe toward the south. The white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi) is the most serious insect pest in Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia; weevil damage has been the most serious deterrent to management of Sitka spruce in the southern part of its range. Damage is most severe on young trees 3 to 6 in (10 to 20 ft) tall. The weevil is not a problem on the Queen Charlotte Islands or in Alaska, possibly because there is insufficient summer heat to allow its development (22). The spruce aphid (Elatobium abietinum) feeds on Sitka spruce from California to Alaska and is a pest of ornamental trees. Epidemics are sporadic and short lived. A root-collar weevil (Steremnius carinatus) girdles l- and 2-year-old seedlings, causing some losses. The spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) periodically damages stands throughout the range and is a major pest of spruce in British Columbia. In addition, damage from a number of defoliators and other insects is common (13). Sitka spruce is highly susceptible to decay when injured (18). In the past, most emphasis has been on studies of decay in old-growth stands, but currently interest is shifting to young, managed stands. Some of the organisms causing decay in old growth (for example, Heterobasidion annosum and Armillaria mellea) can also cause root rot in young stands. Heterobasidion annosum infects freshly cut stump surfaces, and in Europe the tendency for plantation-grown Sitka spruce to develop H. annosum butt rot is well known. Foliage and stem diseases are usually of minor importance. Several rusts cause occasional light to moderate defoliation, witches' brooms, or loss of cones. Seed and seedling diseases are probably most important in production of containerized seedlings in greenhouses. Sitka spruce is damaged at various locations by animals such as elk, bear, deer, porcupines, rabbits, hares, and squirrels. In general, these problems are more serious in the southern part of the range. Deer are generally more troublesome in the southern part, porcupines in the northern part (25). Spruce is often less damaged than its associates. Few growth abnormalities have been reported, although large tumorlike growths on stems have been reported in Washington, and they occur in Alaska as well. The causal agent is not known.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sitka Spruce,picea,sitchensis,conifer,14,1
"Sitka spruce grows on Entisols, Spodosols, Inceptisols, and Histosols, on soils derived from a wide variety of parent material. The species requires relatively high amounts of available calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, and grows best where soils are derived from rocks rich in calcium and magnesium (19). Best development is on deep, moist, well-aerated soils. Drainage is an important factor, and growth is poor on swampy sites. Sitka spruce commonly occupies alluvial soils along streams, sandy or coarse-textured soils, or soils having a thick accumulation of organic material. Soils are usually acidic, and pH values of 4.0 to 5.7 are typical. Spruce is an early pioneer on immature soils recently exposed by glacial retreat or uplift from the sea. It is more tolerant of ocean spray than are associated trees and often occupies a prominent position on exposed headlands and beaches along the outer coast (2). In Oregon and Washington, spruce follows lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in succession on coastal sand dunes as they become stabilized by vegetation. On highly disturbed sites, it frequently becomes established concurrently with red alder (Alnus rubra) or Sitka alder (A. sinuata), gradually succeeding the alder as stands are eventually overtopped. Sitka spruce grows from sea level to treeline in Alaska, at elevations ranging from 910 m (3,000 ft) in southeast Alaska to 300 m (1,000 ft) in Prince William Sound. High mountains of the coast ranges lie close to the sea, forming a barrier to moist, onshore winds and providing abundant moisture during the growing season. Spruce is limited in elevation by the short growing season at treeline. South of northern British Columbia, spruce is restricted to low elevations near the sea where moist maritime air and fog help provide moisture during summer. For the most part, high mountains that otherwise might offer suitable habitat lie farther inland where more continental conditions of summer drought and warmer temperatures are unsuitable for growth. Exceptions are on the Olympic Peninsula and in valleys in the Cascade Range off Puget Sound in Washington, and on isolated peaks in Oregon. On the Olympic Peninsula, Sitka spruce rarely grows above 610 rn (2,000 ft) in elevation (1).",Soils and Topography,Sitka Spruce,picea,sitchensis,conifer,15,1
"High strength-to-weight ratio and resonant qualities of clear lumber are attributes that have traditionally made Sitka spruce wood valuable for specialty uses, such as sounding boards for high-quality pianos; guitar faces; ladders; construction components of experimental light aircraft; oars, planking, masts, and spars for custom-made or traditional boats; and turbine blades for wind energy conversion systems.",Special Uses,Sitka Spruce,picea,sitchensis,conifer,16,1
"Slash pine is a major component of three forest cover types including Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 83), Slash Pine (Type 84), and Slash Pine-Hardwood (Type 85) (18).

"The climate within the natural range of slash pine is warm and humid with wet summers and drier falls and springs. Rainfall averages about 1270 mm (50 in) per year and summer rains of 13 mm (0.5 in) or more occur about four times per month. The mean annual temperature in the slash pine region is 17° C (63° F), with extremes of 41° C (106° F) and -18° C (0° F), and a growing season of 250 days. It has been suggested that the average minimum temperature may be the most critical factor limiting the distribution of slash pine; however, precipitation, fire, or competition may be important in specific areas (21).",Climate,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,2,1
"Slash pine crosses naturally with the South Florida variety where their ranges meet and introgression has occurred among trees in the transition zone to the degree that it is difficult to distinguish between the two varieties (52). In areas where the natural distribution of slash pine overlaps that of the other pines, natural hybridization is usually precluded by phenology. Sand pine (P. clausa) is the earliest flowering pine and is followed by slash, longleaf, loblolly, and shortleaf (P. echinata) pines, the latter of which tend to shed pollen when slash pine strobili are no longer receptive. Late flowering sand pine or early flowering longleaf pine may hybridize with slash pine. Successful artificial hybridization depends on the choice of the female parent species as well as the particular individual of the species. There has been more successful sound seed produced in the slash x longleaf cross than in the reciprocal and no sound seeds were obtained in the sand x slash pine cross. Slash pine has been artificially crossed with longleaf, loblolly, shortleaf, pitch (P. rigida), and Caribbean (P. caribaea) pines. None of the offspring show potential hybrid vigor. The longleaf x slash hybrid shows the most potential because height growth begins quickly; it grows almost as fast as slash pine, self prunes well, is fairly resistant to both brown-spot needle disease and fusiform rust, and resembles longleaf pine in form and branching habit. On swampy sites in Australia there is some indication the Caribbean x slash hybrid progeny show superior yield to either parent alone. Slash x shortleaf hybrids have up to 16 percent dwarfs with some polyploids and mixoploids.",Hybrids,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,9,1
"South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa Little & Dorman) is a variety of slash pine found on about 121 410 ha (300,000 acres) (48) in the southern half of the peninsula of Florida (21,32,35). It grows in pure stands on flatwood sites in the southern part of its range and on swampy or streamside sites in the northern part (32). Where its range overlaps with the typical slash pine, there is a transition zone where morphological traits show clinal variation between the two varieties (52). The range of South Florida slash pine also overlaps with that of longleaf pine(P. palustris) in transition zones between wet and dry sites, with longleaf more numerous on the drier sites (32). South Florida slash pine is characterized by long needles, although they are not as long as those of longleaf, in fascicles of two, rarely three (21); a thick needle hypodermus; 5 to 10 resin canals per needle (58); thick branches with needles appearing clumped at the end; hard wood; whitish bud scales; a high specific gravity of 0.894, due to wide summerwood rings; and cones 20 percent smaller than typical slash pine (27). The seedlings have a grass stage similar to longleaf pine and a thick taproot (21). Mature trees have an irregular crown (58). Even-aged management, accomplished by leaving 15 to 25 trees per hectare (6 to 10 trees/acre) after a cut of 62 to 99 shelterwood trees per hectare (25 to 40/acre), appears to be the most successful silvicultural system for South Florida slash pine (33,34). If a stand is clearcut, direct seeding in the fall will give the best stand (40). Intensive site preparation is highly beneficial in reducing competition and available ground fuel. Problems with uneven-aged stand management include a lack of full stocking, fire hazard, since ground fuel accumulates when prescribed burning is prohibited, and root rot. Heavy thinning will give more sawtimber quickly, while light thinnings will give more total growth for pulpwood (33). When wildfires occurred in young stands, one-third of the surviving grass stage seedlings were observed to sprout from the root collar, but sprouts on the leader died back (25). South Florida slash pine is more fire resistant than the typical variety in the seedling and sapling growth stages due to its thicker bark (6,34). Controlled burns are possible when the trees are 3.7 to 4.6 m (12 to 15 ft) tall (25). South Florida slash pine was found to be superior to other southern yellow pines for wood properties except elasticity and shear parallel to the grain. This makes it an excellent timber for construction purposes (42). In its natural range, direct seeded South Florida slash pine will survive and grow as well as the typical variety but will not have as good survival and growth if nursery stock is planted (6,40). For plantings, it is recommended that the typical variety be planted in the South Florida slash pine range using seed from Alachua County in northern Florida (16). Height growth is better if seedlings are planted on beds (21). Drought does not affect diameter growth of older trees, but excessive water will slow it down (31). Once height growth commences, South Florida slash pine has fewer insect and disease problems than the typical variety (6). Pitch canker does affect this variety (7), and as a grass stage seedling it is susceptible to brown spot (Scirrhia acicola). Site index curves and volume tables have been developed for South Florida slash pine (29,30). With a site index of 15.2 m (50 ft) at base age 50 years the average d.b.h. of 1,112 trees per hectare (450/acre) at 20 years was 15 cm (6 in) with growth of 4.6 m³/ha (65 ft³/acre) per year.",Hybrids,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,9,1
"Slash pine has the smallest native range of the four major southern pines. The range extends over 8° latitude and 10° longitude, and 45 percent of the present growing stock is in Georgia (53). Slash pine grows naturally from Georgetown County, SC, south to central Florida, and west to Tangipahoa Parish, LA. Its native range includes the lower Coastal Plain, part of the middle Coastal Plain, and the hills of south Georgia. The species has been established by planting as far north as Tennessee, in north central Georgia, and Alabama. It has also been planted and direct-seeded in Louisiana and eastern Texas where it now reproduces naturally. Within its natural range, the distribution of slash pine was initially determined by its susceptibility to fire injury during the seedling stage. Slash pine grew throughout the flatwoods of north Florida and south Georgia. It was also common along streams and the edges of swamps and bays (21). Within these areas either ample soil moisture or standing water protected young seedlings from frequent wildfires in young forests. With improved fire protection and heavy cutting of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), slash pine has spread to drier sites, replaced longleaf pine in mixed stands, and invaded abandoned fields. This increase in acreage was possible because of slash pine's frequent and abundant seed production, rapid early growth, and ability to withstand wildfires and rooting by hogs after the sapling stage. - The native range of slash pine.",Native Range,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,11,1
"Geographic variation among slash pine stands in different locations tends to be clinal due to a gradual change from a north temperate to a subtropical climate (15). The variation among stands is less in the north than in the south. Slash pine seeds from many sources have been grown in replicated provenance tests at several geographic locations (51,57). When north Florida- south Georgia seed sources were planted north or west of their natural range they did not survive planting or grow as well as trees from South Carolina or Louisiana (51). Trees from southern sources planted in the north do not grow or survive as well as those from northern sources (28). In a northeast Florida plantation, all the trees broke bud at the same time, but trees grown from northern seed sources attained most of their growth early in the season, while trees from southern sources grew the most in the latter part of the season. The southern trees were never able to attain the growth of the northern trees (3). Seed source plantings outside the natural range of slash pine in South Carolina, western Louisiana, and central Mississippi have shown that trees from the southern part of the range are not well adapted to the more extreme northern and western environmental stresses of cold, ice, and extreme drought (51,54). A provenance test in western Louisiana showed that trees from seed sources in northeast Florida and south Georgia did not survive or grow as well in Louisiana as those from the western part of the slash pine range (51). The most rapidly growing trees in east-to-west plantings came from seed sources in Georgia, western Florida, and southern Mississippi (22). Twelve morphological traits have been studied in cones, seeds, and foliage of five parent trees from each of 54 locations, and 13 traits have been studied in their seedlings (52). The coefficients of variation tended to be highest for seedlings within mother trees and lower among stands and among mother trees within stands. Genetic variation among mother trees within stands was usually not much greater than stand-to-stand variation, suggesting that genetic gains are feasible through selection among stands as well as among individuals within stands. The highest incidence of fusiform rust occurs among sources in southern Georgia, but no clear geographic patterns are apparent. There is also a strong interaction of seed source with site in the occurrence of fusiform rust (22).",Population Differences,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Slash pine is monoecious and wind pollinated. Flowering begins at a relatively early age for conifers, usually between 10 and 15 years, but occasionally as early as 3 years (2). Bisexual cones have been observed (41). Open-grown trees that are fertilized and irrigated tend to flower at an early age. Similar treatments in close-spaced plantings do not result in earlier flowering. Mature scions grafted to seedling rootstocks begin flowering after 2 to 3 years and flower normally by 8 years if planted at wide spacings. Early development of male strobili begins in June and continues for several weeks. Strobili become visible as small knobs near the base of vegetative buds in the fall. They usually occur in clusters of 12 or more, arranged spirally around the base of the current year's branches in the middle or lower crown. Further growth is delayed until midwinter. The staminate strobili are purple and 5 cm (2 in) long when pollen is shed in late January and February. Development of female strobili begins between late August and mid-September. The female strobili are visible by December or January; they occur singly or in clusters and are most abundant on primary and secondary branches in the upper crown. They continue to grow until fully developed, by February in Florida and March further north. Female strobili are about 2.5 cm (1 in) long and red to purple at the time of pollination. They are receptive to pollen for a few days; receptivity of all strobili on a single tree may span a 2-week period. Outcrossing is normal because pollen shed and receptivity of female strobili occur at different times on the same tree. Selfing can occur under natural conditions and in seed orchards, but both yield of viable seed and vigor of trees produced is low. Seed Production and Dissemination- Some seeds are produced each year, with good crops about every third year. In natural stands, cone production was increased by 50 to 100 percent after each of the following treatments: heavy thinning or crown release, stem injury, and fertilization applied before flower bud initiation. Wide initial spacing, fertilization, competition control, and irrigation are used to maintain a high level of production in seed orchards. Age, crown size, and genetic and environmental factors interact to influence seed production once a tree begins to bear cones. Slash pine cones mature during September, approximately 20 months after pollination. There is a wide variation in time of cone maturation among trees, regions, and years. The specific gravity of cones with mature seeds is about 0.9 and they float in SAE 20 motor oil. Cones begin to open when the specific gravity decreases to 0.7. Natural seedfall occurs primarily in October but may be hastened by dry weather or delayed by wet weather. A few seeds may fall until March. Seed viability is increased if collected cones are stored several weeks before seeds are extracted. There are 21,160 to 42,550 seeds per kilogram (9,600 to 19,300/lb) and the average is about 29,760/kg (13,500/lb) (55). More than 90 percent of the winged seeds usually fall within 46 m (150 ft) of the parent tree. A slash pine plantation 13 to 16 years old, 15.2 m (50 ft) tall, grown initially at a spacing of 5.8 by 5.8 m (19 by 19 ft) or 297 stems per hectare (120/acre), will produce seeds at an average of 30.3 kg/ha (27 lb/acre) per year. Seedling Development- Seed viability is usually good. Fresh seeds germinate rapidly, many within 2 weeks of natural seedfall if soil moisture is adequate. Those kept in cold storage for a year or more benefit from stratification (38). Germination is epigeal (55). Newly germinated seedlings have an average of 7.2 cotyledons, 30 mm (1.18 in) long. Hypocotyls average 37 mm (1.46 in) in length and 0.89 mm (0.035 in) in diameter. Seedlings in the cotyledon stage cannot be positively distinguished by external characteristics from those of loblolly (Pinus taeda) or Virginia (P. virginiana) pines (37). Seed size, which is quite variable, does not influence germination in the laboratory or nursery. Small seeds produce smaller seedlings than medium or large seeds, but field survival and average heights 1 to 2 years after field planting are similar for trees from seeds of all sizes. Root development of seedlings is influenced by soil texture and structure. In one field study, taproot length was similar for first-year seedlings in all soils, but number of laterals and total length of all roots were largest on a clay, intermediate on a loam, and least on a sandy soil (23). The presence of mycorrhizae has an important beneficial influence on survival and early growth of bare-root seedlings of all morphological grades (24). Juvenile trees past the seedling stage make from two to four height-growth flushes each year. The first begins when the winter bud elongates to become the spring shoot. Spring shoot growth begins slowly in February and gradually increases until it reaches a mean daily increment of about 7 mm (0.28 in) between mid-March and mid-April. Growth of this first shoot is completed by early June. First summer buds form in April, while the spring shoot is still growing, and second summer shoots are formed by the end of May. Winter buds are present in July and height growth is slow thereafter, although some growth may occur as late as October. The spring shoot makes up 62 percent and the summer shoots 38 percent of the annual height increment. Height growth patterns may be influenced by silvicultural practices, previous land use, and competing vegetation. Site index curves for plantations on recently abandoned fields that were cultivated and fertilized are different from those for stands on areas formerly in timber and having a dense ground cover of brush or other low vegetation when planted to trees. Radial growth begins in early February, about the same time as height growth, and continues throughout the summer and into October or November, as long as soil moisture is adequate. Root growth accelerates in early February, before terminal and radial activity begin. Root growth rates are fastest and the percentage of actively growing tips is highest in summer when soil moisture is optimum, but some root growth takes place during all seasons of the year. Survival and early growth of seedlings are frequently stimulated by intensive site preparation treatments such as flat disking, chopping, or bedding. Disking and chopping are effective on deep, dry, sandy soils where they control competing vegetation, incorporate organic matter into the topsoil, and may alter nutrient availability (9). On sites with a shallow water table, bedding provides increased rooting space, improves aeration, and may increase growth (39). Surface drainage may produce a similar response (26). On droughty sites, weed control and irrigation may be effective (1). Many slash pine sites are low in available phosphorus and nitrogen. In creased volume growth may result from fertilization with either element alone or a combination of both, depending on soil conditions (20,43). Combinations of mechanical site treatment and fertilization may be more effective than either treatment alone (1). Vegetative Reproduction- Vegetative reproduction of slash pine rarely occurs naturally, but several techniques have been developed to reproduce specific individuals for use in seed orchards, clone banks, and genetic studies. Scions from mature trees are grafted onto seedling rootstocks in seed orchards and this is probably the most widely used technique of vegetative reproduction. The ""cleft"" graft is used with either succulent or dormant material. Normally, dormant scions are grafted onto stock plants just beginning active growth in early spring. Air-layering (rooting undetached branches on young trees by girdling and treating them with a rooting hormone) has been more than 85 percent successful in some tests. Factors influencing results include age of the tree, concentration of the rooting hormone, season of treatment, and geographic location. Air layers usually develop a balanced root system and grow rapidly. Cuttings from branches are difficult to root, especially those from older trees. There is considerable variation in results among trees, seasons, chemical treatments, and environmental factors. Enhanced carbon dioxide and a heated rooting medium greatly increase rooting. Needle fascicles can also be rooted, but the results are as poor and inconsistent as those with branch cuttings. In addition, most of the fascicles that form roots never begin height growth.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Slash pine makes rapid volume growth at early ages and is adaptable to short rotations under intensive management. Yield tables have been available for natural stands since 1929 (4,45,47,56) and for plantations since 1955 (13,21). Stand basal area density has a strong influence on merchantable yield at any age (table 1). Also, almost three-fourths of the 50-year yield is produced by age 30, regardless of stand basal area. Current merchantable volume increment in thinned stands reaches a maximum rate before 20 years and declines thereafter (table 2). The instantaneous volume growth rate culminates at a high density in young stands and at progressively lower densities as age increases. Heavy thinning reduces periodic growth in young stands, but any density above 23 m²/ha (100 ft²/acre) at 20 to 30 years, or above 17 m²/ha (75 ft²/acre) at age 40, results in near-maximum volume growth. Plantation yields are influenced by previous land use and interspecies competition, so there is wide variation in estimated wood production (table 3). Early yields are usually highest on recently abandoned fields where the young trees apparently benefit from the residual effects of tillage or fertilizer and the nearly complete lack of vegetative competition. Plantations established after the harvest of natural stands and without any site treatment other than burning generally have lower survival and, consequently, lower basal area and volume than stands on old fields (13). Yields in plantations established after timber harvest and intensive site preparation such as disking or bedding are usually intermediate (10). Below age 30, maximum cubic volume yields are usually produced in unthinned plantations, so landowners seeking maximum yields on a short rotation will seldom find commercial thinning beneficial. Where sawtimber is the objective, commercial thinnings provide early returns while improving the growth and quality of the sawtimber and maintaining the stands in a vigorous and healthy condition (11). Rooting Habit- Slash pine develops an extensive lateral root system and a moderate taproot. Maximum length of the lateral roots was more than double the tree height in three out of four site preparation treatments at 5 years. Taproots may be deformed as a result of poor planting technique, a restricting soil horizon, or a high water table (46). Reaction to Competition- Slash pine is relatively intolerant of competition and is classed as intolerant of shade. Stands protected from fires are invaded and replaced by more tolerant hardwood species. Unreleased seedlings established by direct seeding under a hardwood overstory seldom exceed 15 cm (6 in) in height the first year, while those freed from competition may reach 41 cm (16 in) (38). Increased survival and growth of young trees on intensively prepared sites is attributed largely to the control of competing vegetation. Because of this intolerance, even-aged management is usually recommended for slash pine (21,33). Either the seed-tree or shelterwood system of natural regeneration may be used (34). Exposed mineral soil is of primary importance in establishing natural regeneration. Overstory seed trees should be removed promptly after the new seedlings are well established. Failure to do so may retard growth in height, diameter, and merchantable volume of the next crop (19). An alternative to natural regeneration is to clearcut and establish a new stand by planting or direct seeding. Damaging Agents- The most serious disease of slash pine is fusiform rust caused by the fungus Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme. Most of the southern oaks serve as alternate hosts but the fungus damages only pines. Many trees are killed and others may become too deformed for high value products. Site treatments such as fertilization or vegetation control increase susceptibility to the disease. Resistance to the fungus is inherited, and attempts are being made to breed resistant strains. Annosus root rot, caused by the fungus Heterobasidion annosum, is another serious disease of slash pine. It is most damaging on soils with good surface and internal drainage and is not a problem in flatwoods or shallow soils with heavy clay within 30 cm (12 in) of the surface. Infections begin when spores germinate on a fresh stump surface; the fungus then spreads to adjacent trees through root contacts. Diseased or dead and dying trees are usually found in groups. Pitch canker, caused by the fungus Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans, causes heavy damage to slash pines in nurseries, seed orchards, and plantations. Cankers high in the crown may kill only the leader and a few laterals; the tree survives with a stem deformity and reduced growth. Cankers below the crown may eventually girdle the trunk and kill the tree (8). The pales weevil (Hylobius pales) invades logging areas, feeds on the bark of seedlings, and may girdle the stem, causing wilting and eventual death. Small trees may be defoliated by the pine webworm (Tetralopha robustella), blackheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion excitans), redheaded pine sawfly (N. lecontei), and Texas leafcutting ant (Atta texana). The black turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus terebrans) and engraver beetles (Ips spp.) can become problems. Slash pine is not particularly susceptible to injury by the southern pine beetle (D. frontalis) except where it is growing under environmental stress. Other agents generally cause little damage, but some cause considerable losses under certain conditions. Senna seymeria (Seymeria cassioides) is one of a number of native root parasites that attack slash pine. Damage of economic importance is well documented but rare. Root rots may be a problem in tree nurseries or overmature stands. Red heart (Phellinus pini) is usually associated with mature or overmature timber and is not a problem in well-managed stands. Southern cone rust (Cronartium strobilinum) may destroy a cone crop and is particularly damaging in seed orchards as are several seed and cone insects (17). Young slash pines are susceptible to injury by wildfires until they are 3.0 to 4.6 m (10 to 15 ft) tall and the bark has thickened. Up to 50 percent of the needles may be scorched, but not consumed, with little mortality or growth loss. Slash pine may suffer severe damage from glaze, particularly heavily thinned stands. It is subject to windthrow on shallow soils and wherever it does not develop a strong root system (14).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,14,1
"Soils within the range of slash pine are mostly Spodosols, Ultisols, and Entisols. Spodosols and Entisols are common along the coasts of Florida while the Ultisols are in the northern part of the range. The most frequently found suborders are Udults, Aquults, Psamments, and Aquods. Topography varies little throughout the southeastern Coastal Plain, but small changes in elevation frequently coincide with abrupt changes in soil and site conditions. Although slash pine is adaptable to a variety of site and topographic conditions, it grows best on pond margins and in drainages where soil moisture is ample but not excessive and the soil is well aerated. Growth is unsatisfactory on deep, well drained sands (sandhills) and on poorly drained savanna soils with high water tables (crawfish flats). Growth is intermediate on inadequately drained soils. Specific factors related to height growth, and hence to productivity, vary somewhat, but the most influential are those related to the amount of water or space available to tree roots. Height growth of slash pine plantations in Florida was estimated from three soil factors: depth to a fine textured horizon, depth to a mottled horizon, and silt plus clay content of the finest textured horizon in the soil profile. The first two alone explained 89 percent of the variation in height at a given age and gave height estimates adequate for field use (21). Where internal drainage was adequate, the height of slash pine increased directly with the amount of silt and clay in the subsoil (12). Average site index (base age 50 years) ranged from 22.9 m (75 ft) for sands and loamy sands to 27.4 m (90 ft) for silty clays and other fine textured soils. In the Carolina sandhills, slash pine heights increased with thickness of the A, soil horizon and decreased with depth to fine textured horizons (44). In southeastern Louisiana, site index increased with depth of the least permeable layer, sand content of the subsoil, and degree of internal drainage. Site index decreased where the least permeable layer was too deep, the topsoil was too sandy, or the soil was excessively drained internally (36). Mean total height of dominants and codominants was related to seasonal rainfall, slope, and potential available moisture storage of the subsoil in 87 test plantings throughout Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Optimum conditions within the range of data were 610 mm (24 in) of rain from April through September, 790 mm (31 in) of rain from October through March, 5 percent slope, and 7 percent available moisture storage capacity in the subsoil. Dominant and codominant trees average 19.6 m (64.3 ft) tall at 20 years under these conditions (49).",Soils and Topography,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,15,1
"Slash pine is worked for naval stores. This industry, one of the oldest in the United States, has supplied a large portion of the resin and turpentine used throughout the world since colonial times. In many early forests, gum was the primary and sometimes the only product harvested. Chipping the trees for oleoresin increases bark thickness and reduces volume growth inside the bark 20 to 25 percent. A strain of inherently high-gum-yielding slash pine has been selected, and seedlings are commercially available in Florida and Georgia. Cattle frequently graze the slash pine forests. Moderate grazing does little damage to trees past the seedling stage and may be indirectly beneficial by preventing the buildup of a dense and highly flammable understory. Slash pine seeds are eaten by a variety of birds and small mammals. The dense foliage provides protective cover for many wildlife species during inclement weather. Slash pine may be planted to stabilize the soil on eroding slopes and strip mine spoil banks, where its rapid early growth is an advantage over slower growing species.",Special Uses,Slash Pine,pinus,elliottii,conifer,16,1
"Slippery elm grows over such a wide range of climatic, soil, and topographic conditions that its associates include more than 60 deciduous tree species. It is a common associate in the forest cover types Black Oak-American Elm-Red Maple (Society of American Foresters Type 39), Hawthorn (Type 109), White Oak-Black Oak- Northern Red Oak (Type 52), and River Birch-Sycamore (Type 61) (5). It probably also appears in Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62) and as an occasional tree in several other cover types. Common associates in uplands include bur, chinkapin, white, black, and northern red oaks (Quercus macrocarpa, Q. muehlenbergii, Q. alba, Q. velutina, and Q. rubra); shagbark, bitternut, mockernut, and pignut hickories (Carya ovata, C. cordiformis, C. tomentosa, and C. glabra); sugar, red, and silver maples (Acer saccharum, A. rubrum, and A. saccharinum); boxelder (A. negundo); white ash (Fraxinus americana); American elm (Ulmus americana); blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica); basswood (Tilia americana); black cherry; black walnut (Juglans nigra); hackberry (Celtis occidentalis); and honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos). On periodically flooded lowlands slippery elm commonly occurs with silver and red maple, American elm, eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), hackberry, blackgum, and honeylocust. Common understory species of slippery elm stands include blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis); black raspberry (R. occidentalis); prickly, hairystem, and Missouri gooseberries (Ribes cynosbati, R. hirtellum, and R. missouriense); roundleaf, alternate-leaf, redosier, gray, and flowering dogwoods (Cornus rugosa, C. alternifolia, C. stolonifera, C. racemosa, and C. florida); beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta); American hazelnut (C. americana); Atlantic leatherwood (Dirca palustris); ninebark (Physocarpus spp.); climbing bittersweet (Celastrus scandens); Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia); grape (Vitis spp.); American and redberry elders (Sambucus canadensis and S. pubens); nannyberry (Viburnum lentago); blackhaw (V. prunifolium); witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana); poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans); American bladdernut (Staphylea trifolia); coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus); wild hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens); eastern burningbush (Euonymus atropurpureus); and trailing wahoo (E. obovatus) (4,11).",Associated Forest Cover,Slippery Elm,ulmus,rubra,hardwood,1,0
"Annual precipitation generally increases from northwest to southeast across the range of slippery elm (11).

"Morphological observations that the Ulmus genera is composed of two distinct groups were confirmed with analyses of leaf flavonoids (13). Slippery and American elm, the unwinged species, produce kaempferol and quercetin, while the winged species produce myrictein. No studies of genetic diversity have been reported for slippery elm. Because this species is so widely distributed, ecotypes and races probably exist. Like those of most elm species, vegetative cells of naturally growing slippery elm contain 28 chromosomes (14 pairs) and there are no genetic barriers to gene exchange among diploid elm species (10). Slippery elm is commonly crossed with Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila). The F, hybrids tend to have morphological characteristics intermediate between parents and grow faster than Siberian elm but the susceptibility of these hybrids, as well as three species combined with Japanese elm (U. japonica), to Dutch elm disease is a function of the proportion of slippery elm genes present (7). Pollination of Chinese elm (U. parvifolia) and September elm (U.serotina) with slippery elm pollen have produced hybrid seedlings. Natural hybrids of rock elm and slippery elm have been observed in Sawyer County, WI, and along streets in Columbia, MO. Ecological isolation probably accounts for the limited occurrence of natural hybrids of these two species (11). A triploid elm has been reported that was determined to be an F, seedling of Siberian elm x slippery elm.",Genetics,Slippery Elm,ulmus,rubra,hardwood,7,0
"Slippery elm extends from southwestern Maine west to New York, extreme southern Quebec, southern Ontario, northern Michigan, central Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota; south to eastern South Dakota, central Nebraska, southwestern Oklahoma, and central Texas; then east to northwestern Florida and Georgia. Slippery elm is uncommon in that part of its range lying south to Kentucky and is most abundant in the southern part of the Lake States and in the cornbelt of the Midwest (8). -The native range of slippery elm.",Native Range,Slippery Elm,ulmus,rubra,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Slippery elm has inconspicuous, perfect flowers that appear in the spring before the leaves, from February to May, depending on weather and location. Seeds ripen from April to June and are dispersed by wind as soon as they are ripe. Large crops are borne every 2 to 4 years, beginning after age 15 (2). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seeds of slippery elm are larger than many of the native elms. They range from 77,200 to 119,000/kg (35,000 to 54,000/lb) and average 90,400/kg (41,000/lb). Dispersal is by gravity and wind (2). Seedling Development- Seeds sometimes show dormancy and seedlings are susceptible to damping off. Germination is epigeal (2). Seedlings become established under a wide variety of conditions. Mineral soil seedbeds are best but seeds germinate and survive in forest litter or among grasses and other herbaceous plants. In southeastern Minnesota woodlots the species reproduces more successfully than any other except aspen (Populus spp.) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera). In Ogle County, IL, it was the third most important tree species on abandoned pastureland. On gravel bars along the Jacks Fork and Current Rivers in Missouri, slippery elm does not become an important stand component until the bars have already been invaded by pioneer species such as water-willow (Justica spp.), Coastal Plain willow (Salix caroliniana), and eastern cottonwood. Juvenile growth of slippery elm is rapid in the open or under light shade and slightly exceeds that of American elm. In southeastern Minnesota, trees 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter were 7 to 18 years old, depending on severity of competition. Vegetative Reproduction- Slippery elm sprouts readily from stumps. During its seedling stage it produces sprouts from rhizomes that sometimes form reproduction less than 0.6 m (2 ft) tall in patches 9.1 rn (30 ft) or more in diameter. Roots can be formed in 1 year by layering. Rootstocks of slippery elm are often used to propagate hybrid elms.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Slippery Elm,ulmus,rubra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The height growth of slippery elm is most rapid in trees 20 cm. (8 in) or less in d.b.h. In a streamside forest in Illinois, slippery elm increased 10 cm (0.4 in) in d.b.h. from 25 cm (9.7 in) to 26 cm (10.1 in) in 11 years. In a stand in Polk County, WI, suppressed and intermediate trees grew 11 mm (0.43 in) while codominant and dominant trees grew 2.9 cm (1.14 in) in 8 years. On average sites, slippery elm reaches 18.3 to 21.3 m (60 to 70 ft) in height and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. On the best sites individuals may reach 41.1 m (135 ft) in height and 122 cm (48 in) in d.b.h. The largest living specimen, located in Perry County, PA, is 27.4 rn (90 ft) tall and 193 cm (76 in) in d.b.h. Reaction to Competition- On sites to which it is well adapted, slippery elm is one of the more shade-tolerant species. It is much more tolerant than quaking aspen but slightly less tolerant than sugar maple. Reproduction is erratic under fully stocked stands. In a river terrace forest in east-central Illinois, slippery elm was present in most size classes but there were no seedlings, whereas a nearby upland coppice stand contained numerous slippery elm seedlings. It is most frequently a component of the subcanopy. Overall, it is classed as tolerant of shade. Damaging Agents- Excluding insect species that feed only on American elm, more than 125 insect species feed on trees in the elm genus (1). Bark beetles and wood borers generally cause little damage to vigorous trees although some can ultimately kill weakened or diseased trees. They also introduce stain and rot organisms into dead trees and manufactured products. The spread of Dutch elm disease is the most detrimental effect of bark beetle feeding. The smaller European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatus) is the primary vector of this disease in the United States, but the native elm bark beetle (Hylurgopinus rufipes, Scolytus mali, and Xylosandrus germanus) are also able to transmit it. Only a few defoliators feed exclusively on elms and even fewer feed exclusively on slippery elm. The elm calligrapha (Calligrapha scalaris), the elm leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta luteola), the larger elm leaf beetle (Monocesta coryli), Canarsia ulmiarrosorella, an elm casebearer (Coleophora u1mifoliella), Nerice bidentata, and one species of the genus Macroxyela usually feed only on elms. Slippery elm is especially favored by the larger elm leaf beetle. Elms are preferred hosts for Dasychira basiflava, fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), spring cankerworm (Paleacrita vernata), whitemarked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), the yellownecked caterpillar (Datana ministra), and the elm sawfly (Cimbex americana). Although larvae of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) will feed on leaves of slippery elm, it is not a preferred host. Sucking insects that feed exclusively on elm or prefer elm to most other species include elm cockscombgall aphid (Colopha ulmicola), Tetraneura u1mi, European elm scale (Gossyparia spuria), elm scurfy scale (Chionaspis americana), elm leaf aphid (Tinocallis ulmifolii), woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum), and woolly elm bark aphid (E. rileyi). The gall aphid (Kaltenbachiella u1mifusa) is limited to slippery elm. The whitebanded elm leafhopper (Scaphoideus luteolus) is the principal vector of elm phloem necrosis. Slippery elm has many of the same diseases as American elm (6). It is attacked and killed by Dutch elm disease caused by the fungus Ceratocystis ulmi. It is also killed by elm yellows or elm phloem necrosis (a mycoplasma-like organism) throughout much of its range. These two diseases are so virulent and widespread that slippery elm seldom reaches commercial size and volume as a forest tree and it is being replaced as a street tree in many localities. A dieback caused by Dothiorella ulmi is widespread from New England to Mississippi and has often been confused with Dutch elm disease. A leaf spot caused by Gnomonia ulmea, brown wood rot caused by Pleurotus ulmarius, white flakey rot caused by P. ostreatus, ustulina butt rot caused by Ustulina vulgaris, slimeflux and wetwood caused by Erwinia nimipressuralis, and nectria canker caused by Nectria galligena all attack slippery elm. In a survey in Davidson County, TN, infestations of mistletoe (Phoradendron flavescens) were more numerous on slippery elm than on any other species except American elm and white ash. Slippery elm is also damaged by several other agents. In mixed hardwood stands, bark stripping by deer is more frequent on slippery elm than on other species. Bark stripping occurred most frequently on stems of saplings and on roots of pole-sized trees(9). Slippery elm also suffers crown breakage following severe ice storms in Wisconsin (3).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Slippery Elm,ulmus,rubra,hardwood,14,0
"Slippery elm grows in soils common to the orders Mollisols and Alfisols. It grows best on moist, rich soils of lower slopes, streambanks, river terraces, and bottom land but it is often found on much drier sites, particularly those of limestone origin (11). Examples of sites on which it is, or has been, an important species are flood plains, terraces, and welldrained uplands in east-central Illinois; the northern Mississippi River flood plain; alluvial terraces in western Pennsylvania; and bottom land, lower ravine slopes, and upland in central New York. Slippery elm, along with black cherry (Prunus serotina) and red maple (Acer rubrum) are frequent invaders of tree plantings following surface-mining (12). Slippery elm can persist on poorly drained soils that are occasionally flooded for periods of 2 or 3 months but it does not reproduce or grow well if flooding is frequent or prolonged. In Illinois, on the flood plain of the Embarrass River, which is usually flooded at least once each year but not for more than 5 days at a time, slippery elm is most abundant along the river levee and at the edge of the flood plain where there is least chance of prolonged flooding. In another strearnside forest, slippery elm was classified as an important subdominant in parts that were not flooded more than 1 percent of the time. In one prairie grove remnant, slippery elm was most important in terms of size and abundance on soils of the Argiudoll group, somewhat less important on Hapludalfs, and least important on Haplaquolls. On the northern Mississippi flood plain, slippery elm is found on the better drained sites; in the upland forest of southern Wisconsin, it is found on the moister sites.",Soils and Topography,Slippery Elm,ulmus,rubra,hardwood,15,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Sourwood is among the latest of the flowering shrubs and trees to bloom, The white, bell-shaped perfect flowers appear from late June to August in copious masses on one-sided racemes clustered in an open particle. The flowers are insect pollinated and are an important honey source in some areas (14). Seed Production and Dissemination- The fruit is a capsule 6 to 13 min (0.25 to 0.5 in) in length. It ripens in September and October, and the tiny seeds are dispersed gradually throughout the winter by the dehiscing capsule. The number of seeds in clean lots range from 4 080 000 to 12 125 000 seeds per kilogram (1,850,000 to 5,500,000/lb) (14). Seedling Development- Seedbed requirements are not known for natural regeneration. In the Piedmont, however, sourwood seedlings and saplings are found in all stages of succession from young pine stands to the oak-hickory climax (10). This indicates that seed germination and establishment may occur on litter and under partially shaded conditions. Techniques have been described for sourwood seed collection, storage, and germination (2,5,14). Acid sandy peat is recommended as a seedbed for sourwood. Germination is epigeal. Vegetative Reproduction- Sourwood sprouts prolifically and persistently from the stump and often must be treated with herbicides to release more desirable species in second growth and in cutover areas (7,9,12,15). Sourwood is difficult to propagate from cuttings. A single report found softwood cuttings (short side shoots), made with a heel and taken in late July with a 90 ppm IBA soak, rooted 80 percent when placed in a sand:peat (equal volumes) mix under mist (5).

"Growth and Yield- The maximum size for sourwood is 24 in (80 ft) in height and 61 cm (24 in) in diameter. It is typically much smaller, reaching 6 to 15 in (20 to 50 ft) in height and 20 to 30 cm (8 to 1 in) in diameter (11). Sourwood usually remains in the forest understory from seedling to maturity. It occasionally enters the overstory in Piedmont lowland pine stands, but on upland sites it attains the upper canopy only if some disturbance removes the overtopping vegetation (10) Sourwood develops a slender trunk and small crown in dense stands. In more open situations it forms a short, often leaning trunk dividing into several stout, ascending limbs. Growth is slow in established stands, but the initial growth of sprout in cutover areas is rapid enough to hinder establishment of more desirable species (7,12). Per-acre volume estimates are not available for this specie because it usually grows in mixture with other species rather than in pure stands. Rooting Habit- No information is currently available on the rooting habit of sourwood. Reaction to Competition- Sourwood is classed as tolerant of shade and can grow and reproduce in the understory of climax (oak-hickory) forest (3,10,11). Its response to release is not definitely known but is thought to be poor. Damaging Agents- Several insects attack sour wood but normally do no serious harm (1). The dog. wood-twig borer, Oberea tripunctata, and the twig girdler, Oncideres cingulata, attack the twigs; the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (7), and the hickory horned devil (the larva of the regal moth), Citheronia regalis, attack the foliage.

Sourwood grows throughout the Piedmont uplands. It is also found along Piedmont streams on well-drained lowland areas not subject to ordinary flooding (10). Where it enters the Coastal Plain it is found on the gently rolling areas of the upper portion; toward the coast it is restricted to old dunes and well-drained slopes and ridges above streams and swamp borders.

It is most prevalent in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (12,14). -The native range of southern magnolia.",Native Range,Southern Magnolia,magnolia,grandiflora,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The large, white, fragrant flowers are perfect (19) and appear from April to June. The fleshy conelike fruit matures from September through the late fall. When the fruit matures and opens, seeds 6 to 13 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in) long emerge and hang temporarily suspended by slender, silken threads before dropping (2). Seed Production and Dissemination- The seeds are drupelike, with a soft, fleshy outer seedcoat and an inner stony portion. Southern magnolia is a prolific seed producer and good seed crops normally occur every year (14). Trees as young as 10 years old can produce seed, but optimum seed production under forest conditions usually does not occur until age 25. Cleaned seeds range in number from 12,800 to 15,000/kg (5,800 to 6,800/lb) and average 14,200/kg (6,450/lb) (19). Seed viability averages about 50 percent. The relatively heavy seeds are disseminated mostly by birds and mammals, but some may be spread by heavy rains. Seedling Development- Seeds usually germinate the first or second spring following seedfall Germination is epigeal (19). The best natural seedbed is a rich, moist soil protected by litter. Even though viable, seeds rarely germinate under the parent tree because of reported inhibitory effects (3). Seedlings are very susceptible to frost damage, and even a light freeze can cause mortality. Partial shade is beneficial for the first 2 years of seedling growth. Under favorable conditions growth is quite rapid. In nurseries, seedlings usually grow 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) the first year (2). Vegetative Reproduction- Mature southern magnolia commonly develops root and stump sprouts (3). Portions of lower limbs of saplings often become imbedded in the forest floor where they develop roots, eventually producing separate trees. Air-layering, stem cuttings, and grafts have all been used to propagate the species for ornamental plantings.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Southern Magnolia,magnolia,grandiflora,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- On good sites, southern magnolia trees average 18 to 24 in (60 to 80 ft) tall and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. in 80 to 120 years. Heights of 30 to 38 in (100 to 125 ft) have been reported in Florida (2). Annual diameter growth for large mature trees in an east Texas stand was .24 cm (.09 in) (8). In unmanaged natural stands in the Florida panhandle, trees without overtopping competition will average .76 cm (.3 in) of diameter growth and 0.46 m (1.5 ft) of height growth per year through age 50. Under natural conditions, many trees spend 10 to 20 years in the understory before they reach the upper canopy. Annual diameter growth for these trees is .51 cm (.2 in) and average height growth is .31 m (1.0 ft) to age 50 years. Rooting Habit- Southern Magnolia is a deep-rooted species, except on sites with a high water table. Seedlings quickly develop one major taproot. As trees grow the root structure changes. Trees of sapling stage and beyond have a rather extensive heart root system (i.e. several to many sunken roots grow down from the root collar of the tree trunk). Older trees may develop a fluted base with the ridges corresponding to the attachment of major lateral roots. Reaction to Competition- Overall, southern magnolia is tolerant of shade. It can endure considerable shade in early life (8), but needs more light as it becomes older (2). It will invade existing stands and is able to reproduce under a closed canopy (3,8). Once established, it can maintain or increase its presence in stands by sprout and seedling production that grows up through openings, which occur sporadically in the canopy. Southern magnolia is considered to be one of the major species of the potential climax forest of the southeastern Coastal Plains (3,6,15,16,20). In the past, regular burning restricted the species to the wetter sites, as seedlings are easily killed by fire. Older trees, however, due to bark characteristics, are quite fire resistant (3,10) and even if the tops are killed, they sprout vigorously. Since the advent of improved fire control, southern magnolia has been migrating onto mesic upland sites and establishing itself, along with associated hardwoods, as part of the climax forest. Damaging Agents- Young southern magnolia are susceptible to fire-caused injury and mortality Winter droughts can cause extensive dieback and mortality. A number of fungi, including species of Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Glomerella, Phyllosticta, and Septoria cause leaf spots but these seldom result in any significant damage (2). A leaf spot caused by Mycosphaerella milleri can be a problem on nursery seedlings. A number of Fomes and Polyporus fungi can cause heartrot in southern magnolia. Heavy infestations of magnolia scale (Neolecanium cornuparyum) can kill branches or entire trees (18). Oleander pit scale (Asterolecanium pustulans) and tuliptree scale (Toumeyella liriodendri) attack and injure southern magnolia, but rarely cause mortality (1). A variety of other pests including tuliptree aphid (Illinoia liriodendri) striped mealybug (Ferrisia virgata), leaf weevil (0dontopus calceatus), magnolia leafminer (Phyllocnistis magnoliella), and spider mite (Tetranychus magnoliae) feed on this species (18). Euzophera magnolialis, a wood borer, can injure or kill nursery seedlings.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Southern Magnolia,magnolia,grandiflora,hardwood,14,0
"Southern magnolia grows best on rich, loamy, moist soils along streams and near swamps in the Coastal Plain (2,14). It also grows on mesic upland sites where fire is rare. Although primarily a bottomland species it cannot withstand prolonged inundation. Thus, it does not appear in the first bottoms but grows mostly on the oldest alluvium and outwash sites. Southern magnolia is found on a number of different soils including those in the orders Spodosols, Alfisols, Vertisols, and Ultisols. Along the coast it grows primarily on soils of the Leon, Bladen, Coxville, Portsmouth, Lake Charles, and Crowley series. Farther inland in central Florida, Georgia, and States to the west, it is found on the Norfolk, Ruston, Greenville, Memphis, Grenada, Caddo, and Beauregard soils. No part of its natural range is higher than 150 m (500 ft) in elevation and most of it is less than 60 m (200 ft). Coastal areas within its range are all less than 30 m (100 ft) above sea level. In the northern parts of the range in Georgia and Mississippi, it is found at elevations of 90 to 120 m (300 to 400 ft).",Soils and Topography,Southern Magnolia,magnolia,grandiflora,hardwood,15,0
"Because of its showy flowers and lustrous evergreen foliage, southern magnolia is a valuable and extensively planted ornamental. In many urban areas where other species do poorly, this magnolia can grow because of its resistance to damage by sulfur dioxide. The seeds are eaten by squirrels, opossums, quail, and turkey (9). The leaves, fruits, bark and wood yield a variety of extracts with potential applications as pharmaceuticals (4,5).",Special Uses,Southern Magnolia,magnolia,grandiflora,hardwood,16,0
"Southern red oak- Is found in nine forest cover types (5). It is a major component of Virginia Pine-Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 78) and Shortleaf Pine-Oak (Type 76). It is a minor component of Virginia Pine (Type 79), Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80), Loblolly Pine (Type 81 1), and Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82). Occasionally it is found with Longleaf Pine (Type 70), Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91), and Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40). Throughout most of its range, southern red oak is usually found as individual trees in mixed stands. It is commonly associated with white oak Quercus alba), black oak (Q. velutina), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q.stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica) sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and hickory (Carya spp.). Along the foothills of the Appalachians, Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), pitch pine (P. rigida), and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) are common associates. Other associates are shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) in the Piedmont, loblolly pine (P. taeda) in the Coastal Plain, and both shortleaf and loblolly pine in eastern Texas, southern Arkansas, and Louisiana. Occasionally associated with southern red oak are swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), cherrybark oak (Q. falcata var. pagodifolia), white ash (Fraxinus americana), slash pine (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pine (P. palustris), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer rubrum), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and persimmon (Diospyros virginiana).",Associated Forest Cover,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,1,0
"The main forest cover type that includes cherrybark oak is Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 91) (14). Typically the composition varies widely, and cherrybark oak and swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii) are often only indicator trees, although they may be the most abundant of the oaks present. Other prominent tree species are white ash (Fraxinus americana), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), mockernut hickory (C. tomentosa), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). Less numerous are blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), white oak (Q. alba), Delta post oak (Q. stellata var. paludosa), and Shumard oak (Q. shumardii). On first bottom ridges sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) may be important. Minor associates include southern red oak (Q. falcata var. falcata), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), willow oak (Q. phellos), water oak (Q. nigra), post oak (Q. stellata), American elm (Ulmus americana), winged elm (U. alata), water hickory (C. aquatica), nutmeg hickory (C. myristiciformis), and occasionally loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and spruce pine (P. glabra). This cover type is widely distributed over the alluvial flood plains of the major rivers, occurring on all ridges in the terraces and on the best, most mature, fine sandy loam soils on the highest first bottom ridges. It extends on first bottom ridges to a few well-drained soils other than sandy loam. These sites are seldom covered with standing water, although, if there are hummocks, the sites between them may be wet. White oak is the predominant tree in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak on the most mature terrace soils. In very limited situations cherrybark oak is found with loblolly pine on terraces, and with spruce pine on terraces and stream fronts and ridges in the first bottoms of small streams of the Coastal Plain east of the Mississippi River. It is found with yellow-poplar and beech only in the second bottoms of small secondary streams and in the Brown Loam Bluffs. Cherrybark oak may be an associated tree on better drained areas in the cover type Willow OakWater Oak-Diamondleaf Oak (Type 88) and on moist sites in Loblolly Pine (Type 81) and Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82).

"Flowering and Fruiting- Southern red oak is monoecious; unisexual flowers of both sexes are borne on the same tree. Flowering occurs during April and May throughout most of the range. The staminate flowers are borne in naked aments (catkins) and the pistillate flowers solitary, or in two- to many-flowered spikes. The fruit is solitary or paired; the nut is enclosed one-third or less in a thin, shallow cup. The fruit ripens in September and October, the second season after flowering, and seedfall occurs during these months. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production usually begins when a tree is about 25 years of age, but maximum production is usually between the ages of 50 and 75 years. Cleaned seeds average 1,190/kg (540/lb). Fall seeding of oaks is preferred to spring seeding in the nursery (17). To obtain the highest first-year survival, it is recommended the acorns be planted not less than 1/2 inch deep and at seedbed densities of 12 to 15 evenly spaced sound seed per square foot (13). Fall beds should be mulched with leaves or straw held in place by hardware cloth covers or other effective materials. The covering also serves as a protection against rodents. It is usually not necessary to produce seedlings older than 1-0 for field planting, but 2-0 seedlings are planted occasionally to obtain larger, vigorous stock with more extensive root systems. In natural stands, dissemination of acorns by gravity is important on steep slopes. The hoarding habit of squirrels is also important in the dispersal of seed of oaks. Seedling Development- The seed of southern red oak germinate under natural conditions in the spring following seedfall. Cool, moist stratification is required for best results. Germination is hypogeal (17). Vegetative Reproduction- Southern red oak sprouts vigorously from the stump when the top has been killed or cut back (6,16). Sprouting is most prevalent on young stems 25.4 cm (10 in) or less in diameter. With well established root systems, growth of sprout-origin stands is rapid, regardless of site quality, for about 20 years (18). Equations have been developed using sprout height at age 5 which predict the diameter growth and competition success of coppice-regeneration at ages 12 and 30 (11). Clones of southern red oak can be propagated from cuttings of rooted stump sprouts and mature branches (4). Cuttings from branches root better than cuttings from stump sprouts. Root initiation is increased when cuttings are treated with the growth hormone IBA and the fungicide folpet, and when cuttings 6.4 mm (0.25 in) or larger are taken from the first flush after it hardens off and just before second flush bud break. Survival after rooting is also increased when larger cuttings are used.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,13,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Cherrybark oak is monoecious; staminate and pistillate catkins are borne separately on the same tree, with the staminate catkins clustered and the pistillate flowers in a solitary position or several together. They are borne on stalks from leaf axils of the current growth. The flowers appear from February to May, depending on latitude. The acorn is about 13 mm (0.5 in) long, globular or hemispheric, with up to one-third of its length enclosed in a shallow thin cap. Seeds per kilogram range from 440 to 1,650 (200 to 750/lb). Acorns mature from August to November of the second year. In central Mississippi, acorns in their second year grew at a steady rate from June through August. Maximum acorn size was reached in September as storage food content increased rapidly and moisture content dropped from 60 to 40 percent. At full physiological maturity, in late October or early November, acorns had attained maximum dry weight and were dark brown, easily separated from their cups, 15 to 20 percent crude fat, 25 percent carbohydrate, and 35 to 40 percent moisture (7). The best method of determining germinability of cherrybark oak acorns is by flotation combined with visual inspection. Both floaters and those with weevil blemishes on the shell or dark, dull cup scars are considered nonviable (8). Moisture content of cherrybark oak acorns is a critical factor. Acorns stratified over winter and then air-dried for more than 4 days did not germinate. Therefore, fall-collected acorns should either be sowed immediately or promptly placed in moist cold storage (23). Cherrybark oak acorns may be stored for up to 18 months at temperatures slightly above freezing if the seeds, at 45 to 50 percent moisture content, are kept in polyethylene bags of at least 0.01 cm (4 mils) thickness, although some will sprout during storage (6). One study showed that the germination percentage of cherrybark oak acorns is significantly reduced by submersion in water for 34 days (27). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seedbearing begins when the trees are about 25 years old, and optimum production is reached when they are between 50 and 75 years of age. Good crops are frequent, occurring at 1- or 2-year intervals, with light crops in intervening years. A freeze in April 1955, after the flower buds opened, resulted in a complete crop failure over much of the tree's range in 1956. Dissemination largely depends on hoarding activity of animals, especially squirrels. In certain situations (first bottoms) dissemination by flooding is possible. Gravity is a minor means of dissemination on the steeper terrace margins (27). Seedling Development- Cherrybark oak regenerates naturally on areas protected from fire and grazing. Being intolerant of shade, it requires full light for development, which in turn induces heavy competition from annual weeds, vines, briars, and brush. It often makes its best development in old fields on well-drained loamy soils (27). Typically, seeds remain dormant after falling and do not germinate until the following spring. Germination is hypogeal. Several studies have involved direct seeding of cherrybark oak acorns. Repellents (arasan, endrin, and anthraquinone) were found to reduce germination (4). One recommendation was to sow 4,940 acorns per hectare (2,000/acre) to obtain 1,230 established seedlings per hectare (500/acre), although elimination of weeviled acorns would reduce seed requirements (21). In South Carolina, direct seeded acorns averaged 30 percent survival, with seedlings 51 cm (20 in) tall after 3 years on sandy loam soils associated with first and second bottoms of small coastal streams. Height growth, which was greater in the open than in the shade, was indicative of natural regeneration development (27). In an Arkansas trial, only 2 percent of cherrybark oak acorns seeded under a deadened low-quality gum and oak stand resulted in established seedlings. High germination over a 3-month period was negated by grass competition, heavy grazing, and severe drought (11). Success of direct seeding in starting stands, therefore, is dependent on favorable climatic and soil conditions together with limited plant and animal competition. Cherrybark oak seedling development has been studied in nurseries and outplantings. The highest percentage of plantable seedlings per unit weight of seeds came from the lowest seedbed density, where densities varied from 43 to 108 seedlings per square meter (4 to 10/ft²) (3). Survival of cherrybark oak seedlings decreased as severity of root and top pruning increased (40). Seedlings started in kraft paper tubes had less growth and survival than bare rooted seedlings when outplanted. The container seedlings were smaller and the tubes restricted root growth (22). In another test of seedlings planted in containers, it was found that after 3 years, those seedlings planted with bare roots or in milk cartons had a better survival rate than those that had been planted in cardboard tubes (33). Pot planting studies of first-year seedlings rated cherrybark oak intolerant of flooding and saturated soils. Seedlings did not develop adventitious roots, as did tolerant species, and leaf mortality was related to moisture deficits (18,19,20). A 1-percent solution of gibberellic acid in lanolin applied to new shoot growth of 1-year-old seedlings significantly increased height growth over a 41-day observation period (31). Growth of planted cherrybark oak seedlings in minor bottoms has been variable, but best growth is usually obtained where vegetative competition is controlled by cultivation. In an Arkansas planting, trees disked annually averaged 4.3 m (14 ft) in 5 years, with 75 percent survival (24). Trees planted in Louisiana were 2.4 in (8 ft) tall after 6 years, and 4.9 in (16 ft) tall after 9 years, with 93 percent survival (1). A Carolina coastal plain planting of cherrybark oak averaged 1.4 m (4.6 ft) and 46 percent survival after 5 years (36). In a test where site preparation consisted of deadening residuals, planted cherrybark oaks were smaller and fewer in number than the natural regeneration after 11 years (13). Amount of cherrybark oak reproduction is mainly determined by seed supply but is also influenced by microclimate, soil factors, and stand variables. Seedling development is related to overhead release, with large openings needed (17). Restricted understory development beneath cherrybark oak trees is apparently caused by leaching of salicylic acid, an inhibitor, from the oak crowns by rain. Reduced germination and growth of seedlings was also shown in greenhouse studies using soil obtained from under cherrybark oak trees (12). Vegetative Reproduction- The tree is reported to sprout from the stump when the shoot has been killed or cut back (27). However, sprouting is not considered a dependable means for obtaining desirable natural regeneration. Seedlings and smaller trees (advance reproduction) sprout more than larger trees, and more sprouting occurs on lower quality sites. Like most oaks, this species is difficult to propagate by cuttings, although in Mississippi air layering has succeeded in April and June (5). Greenwood apical cuttings from 1- to 4-month-old cherrybark oak seedlings have been rooted in 4 weeks under mist after treatment with indolebutyric acid (15).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- At maturity, southern red oak is a medium-size tree, usually from 20 to 25 m (70 to 80 ft) in height and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 36 in) in d.b.h. In forest stands it develops a long, straight trunk and upward-reaching limbs that form a high, rounded crown (16). Natural pruning is excellent in well-stocked stands (19). Maximum age attained is about 150 years. Equations are available for predicting green weights, dry weights, and green volume of sapling, pole-size and sawtimber southern red oak trees, using d.b.h. and total height classes (3,12). Seventy percent of the average tree's green weight is in stem material to a 10-cm (4-in) top, and 30 percent is in crown material. Total-tree wood has an average specific gravity of 0.604, average moisture content of 74 percent, and average green weight of 1057 kg/cm³ (66 lb/ft³) . The weight of wood and bark averages 1297 kg/cm³ (81 lb/ft³) for the entire above-ground portion of the tree. Growth and yield data are not available for stands of southern red oak. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Southern red oak is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance (2) or as intolerant (16), when compared with its associates. Epicormic branching is profuse on southern red oak, especially on recently released crop trees. This reduces the quality of the timber and suggests that good quality occurs only in dense stands. The shelterwood method is recommended for regeneration (7). Early removal of the overstory following stand establishment eliminates suppression from residual seed trees and prevents degrade from epicormic branching. Damaging Agents- Southern red oak is susceptible to injury by fire because of its thin bark. As a result of fire scars and other injuries, this species often is subject to heart rots (16). Cankers and rot caused by Polyporus hispidus are common. Other common rot fungi affecting this species include Hydnum erinaceus, Polyporus sulphureus, P. obtusus, and Fomes everhartii. While southern red oak is highly susceptible to oak wilt caused by Ceratocystis fagacearum, this disease is virtually unknown south of the 35th parallel (9). Several species of Hypoxylon have been found to colonize the trunk sapwood of wilting trees, producing a yellow decay (14). Apparently Ceratocystis fagacearum is unable to compete with the Hypoxylon spp. Drought has been identified as a cause of southern red oak decline and death along the South Carolina coast (15). Hypoxylon atropunctatum was also partially responsible for these losses. Leaf blister caused by Taphrina caerulescens and leaf spots caused by Actinopelte dryina or Elsinoe quercus-falcatae can severely mar the foliage of southern red oak (9). The seedlings are damaged and often killed by the hickory spiral borer, Agrilus arcuatus torquatus, and the oak stem borer, Aneflormorpha subpubescens (16). As in many of the oaks, the acorn is subject to damage by acorn weevils, such as Curculio longidens, C. pardalis, and Conotrachelus posticatus, and the filbertworm, Melissopus latiferreanus. Southern red oak is readily susceptible to borers and bark scarrers when trees are wounded or growing on poor sites. Wood-boring insects attacking this tree are Agrilus bilineatus, Corthylus columbianus, and Cossula magnifica. The defoliators Anisota senatoria and A. stigma also do considerable damage.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,14,0
"Growth and Yield- Cherrybark oaks (fig. 3) often attain heights and diameters of 30.5 to 39.6 m and 91 to 152 cm (100 to 130 ft and 36 to 60 in), respectively, which classes them with the largest of the southern red oaks. It is one of the hardiest and fastest growing oaks and grows well on more sites than any other bottom-land oak except the willow and water oaks. Diameter growth rates range from 7 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) in 10 years (27). As a guide, the maximum gross cubic volume growth per year has been estimated to range from 13 to 19 m³/ha (188 to 275 ft³/acre) on good sites (site indexes from 32 to 40 m (105 to 130 ft) at base age 50). Only one-half to two-thirds of these yields could be expected from good extensive management practices (32). Rooting Habit- Cherrybark oak is classified as having poor windfirmness (30). In the root system of most oaks, the taproot dies back and sinker roots arising from the laterals take over the vertical root function. React on to Competition- Cherrybark oak is often found as individual trees in mixed stands but is sometimes found in groups, and occasionally, with Shumard oak, it dominates a stand. It cannot live under complete shade, however, and is usually found in a dominant or codominant position. It is classed as intolerant of shade and probably becomes established only in openings (27). This oak usually has a relatively branch-free merchantable bole in contrast with other bottom-land red oaks such as pin and willow oak. Often it is conspicuous for this reason, and because of its good form and quality it is regarded as one of the best red oaks (27). Following release or injury this oak produces epicormic sprouts but to no greater degree than many other oaks. Damaging Agents- Wood-boring insects often cause much damage in fire-scarred cherrybark oaks and in overmature trees. Moreover, on poorly drained clay flats or other poor sites, the mature trees are often infested with borers or the wood is mineral streaked. Fires and hurricane winds seem to be instrumental in introducing the borers and mineral streaks (27). Trunk boring insects found in cherrybark oak are the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), oak clearwing borer (Paranthrene simulans), and the living-beech borer (Goes pulverulentus) (34,35). Oak twig galls (multiple species) are a common occurrence in the loessial hills and coastal plain sites. Insects identified as attacking southern red oak probably also attack cherrybark oak; these are the defoliating Anisota oakworms (Anisota spp.), the twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus), Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus), and pecan carpenterworm (Cossula magnifica). Other probable cherrybark oak insects are the hickory spiral borer (Agrilus arcuatus var. torquatus) and the oak-stem borer (Aneflormorpha subpubescens) (27). Hispidus canker (Polyporus hispidus) is common on cherrybark oak. Rot fungi attacking southern red oak and possibly cherrybark oak are Hericium erinaceus, Laetiporus sulphureus, and Daedalea quercina. Leaf blister caused by Taphrina caerulescens occurs frequently. Cherrybark oak is susceptible to oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) (27,28,29,39). Heart rot in standing cherrybark oak trees generally is greater on poor sites than on good sites (37). As in most of the oaks, the acorn is subject to damage by nut or acorn weevils, such as Curculio baculi, C. longidens, C. pardalis, and Conotrachelus posticatus, and the filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus) (27).

"Southern red oak is characteristically an upland tree, growing on dry, sandy, clay soils (1). It is also found widely on sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and silty clay loam soils. Occasionally it grows along streams in fertile bottoms and here reaches its largest size. Overall, southern red oak is most commonly found growing on soils in the orders Utilsols and Alfisols, Throughout its range, southern red oak is most frequently found at elevations up to 610 m (12,000 It) above sea level in both the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions (16). It usually grows on dry ridgetops and upper slopes facing south and west, rather than on moist lower slopes and bottom lands, or north and east aspects (16).",Soils and Topography,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,15,0
"Cherrybark oak is widely distributed on the best loamy sites on first bottom ridges and on welldrained terraces and colluvial sites (27). These sites occur along both large and small streams of the Southeastern Coastal Plain and the Mississippi Valley north into Missouri and Illinois, although the tree is rare in the lower Mississippi Delta. Cherrybark oak develops best on a loamy welldrained soil. Although uncommon on clay soils, it is generally of good form and quality on such soils if the drainage is good but very inferior where drainage is poor. Cherrybark oak is found mostly where surface soil pH is acid to medium acid (10). It is a lowland tree but is seldom numerous on wet or swampy soils. Cherrybark oak also grows in Coastal Plain hummocks. These localized areas, which may be raised above surrounding terrain, are not necessarily associated with any stream but are usually well drained and have a deep soil of good texture. The species is also found on certain upland sites. Included are areas of loessial soil such as the Brown Loam Bluffs bordering the eastern edge of the Mississippi River alluvial plain from Louisiana north. Other favorable sites are found in the rolling hills of the lower Piedmont and certain uplands of the upper Coastal Plain. Here the species grows well in branch heads, coves, and slopes with deep surface soils (27). Overall, cherrybark oak grows most commonly on soils of the order Alfisols and Inceptisols. A site index predictive model for cherrybark oak based on measurable soil variables accounted for less than half the variation in site index. Most significant soil variables were depth to mottling, depth of topsoil, and presence or absence of fragipan (9). A combined objective and subjective approach to site evaluation for cherrybark oak plantations has been developed that is based on soil physical conditions, nutrient availability, moisture availability during the growing season, and aeration. Site index values obtained should be within 1.5 in (5 ft) of measured values 95 percent of the time (2).",Soils and Topography,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,15,0
"The uses of oak include almost everything that mankind has ever derived from trees-timber, food for man and animals, fuel, watershed protection, shade and beauty, tannin, and extractives (17).",Special Uses,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,16,0
"Within the range of this oak, animals and birds include acorns as a substantial part (10 percent or more) of their diets. Among these the heaviest eaters are the gray squirrel, wild turkey, and blue jay, followed by the wood duck, red-bellied woodpecker, redheaded woodpecker, white-breasted nuthatch, common grackle, raccoon, white-tailed deer, and eastern fox squirrel (27).",Special Uses,Southern Red Oak,quercus,falcata,hardwood,16,0
"Southern redcedar is the predominant species in the forest cover type Southern Redcedar (Society of American Foresters Type 73), in which it occupies a plurality (20 to 50 percent) of the basal area (4). Common overstory associates in this type are live oak (Quercus uirginiana), sand live oak (Q. uirginiana var. germinata), cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), slash pine (Pinus elliottii), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), laurel oak Quercus laurifolia), redbay (Persea borbonia), and American holly (Ilex opaca). Common understory species are yaupon (I. vomitoria), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), devilwood (Osmanthus americanus), Carolina laurelcherry (Prunus caroliniana), beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), bumelia (Bumelia spp.), tree sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), and greenbriers (Smilax spp.). Southern redcedar was virtually eliminated as an overstory species during the 19th century by harvesting, primarily for the manufacture of pencils. Live oaks and other associated trees were not cut at that time, and their competition presumably has retarded the reestablishment of cedar-dominated stands. Consequently, Southern Redcedar (Type 73) is quite similar to Cabbage Palmetto (Type 74). Both of these types are variants of a general maritime forest. Inland from this maritime forest, the Southern Redcedar type sometimes intergrades with Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Type 104). Southern redcedar is listed as a minor species in Slash Pine (Type 84), and it has been found in Loblolly Pine (Type 81). In these pine types, redcedars seldom reach the overstory, possibly because of competition from the pines and associated hardwoods.",Associated Forest Cover,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,1,1
"Two climatic types, humid and moist subhumid, are present within the range of southern redcedar. Normal precipitation increases from about 1200 mm (48 in) per year in the Carolinas to more than 1600 mm (63 in) along the central Gulf Coast, then decreases to about 1000 mm (40 in) in eastern Texas. Length of growing season varies from about 240 days in North Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas to more than 330 days along both coasts of central peninsular Florida. Southern redcedar is found from slightly north to slightly south of U.S. Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone 9, which is defined by a range in average minimum temperatures from -7° to -1° C (20° to 30° F).",Climate,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,2,1
Southern redcedar apparently hybridizes freely with eastern redcedar (18). The literature contains nothing else on the genetics of southern redcedar.,Genetics,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,7,1
"The native range of southern redcedar extends from coastal North Carolina through northern Florida and across the Gulf Coast to eastern Texas. Except in the center of the Florida peninsula and in outliers in Louisiana and Texas, the species is found within 50 km (30 mi) of saltwater. On the range map, the inland boundary of the species should not be considered exact because it touches or overlaps the southern boundary of eastern redcedar, which so resembles southern redcedar that the two often are confused. - The native range of southern redcedar.",Native Range,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Southern redcedar is dioecious. The male cones shed pollen in January to February, and the berrylike female cones, dark blue and covered with a glaucous bloom, mature in October to November of the first year (11). Seeds often have dormant embryos, and germination may not occur until the second or third spring after seed maturation (2). Cold stratification, however, hastens germination, and so might stratification of the seed by passage through the digestive system of an animal. Germination is epigeal. Southern redcedar should be sown in fall or cold-stratified and sown in either fall or spring (13). Seed Production and Dissemination- There is considerably more information on the reproduction of eastern redcedar than on southern redcedar. Eastern redcedar produces some seeds nearly every year with irregular heavy seed crops. Its seeds are dispersed in the fall, usually by birds. Seeds may be stored as dried fruits or after extraction with a macerator. Cleaned seeds range from 81 600 to 121 300/kg (37,000 to 55,000/lb). A citric acid soak preceding cold stratification increases germination more than cold stratification alone (13). Seedling Development- Stratified seeds of eastern redcedar sown in the spring should be in the ground early enough to ensure complete germination before air temperatures exceed 21° C (70° F), and complete germination requires 4 to 5 weeks. Juniper seeds are usually drilled into rows 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) apart and covered with about 0.6 cm (0.25 in) of firmed soil. The beds should be mulched with straw, sawdust, burlap, or plastic film, and the mulch removed as soon as germination starts. Light shade should be provided during the first growing season. Eastern redcedar is planted as 2-0, 3-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, or 2-2 stock. Potting or balling for field planting increases survival over bare-root planting during dry years (13). Vegetative Reproduction- Southern redcedar can be propagated by cuttings of nearly ripened wood (2). The closely related species, eastern redcedar, can be propagated by rooted cuttings, but there is much variability among varieties within the species as to ease of rooting. Rooting success has been increased by treatments with indolebutyric acid, naphthalene acetic acid, and Phygon XL talc. Because of the difficulties and inconsistencies in rooting juniper cuttings, grafting has long been the standard method of propagating clonal material of eastern redcedar (18).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Little is known about the growth of this species. It has been reported to be moderate in growth rate (1) or to be long lived and slow growing (17). Mature height has been reported to be about 8 m (25 ft) (1,2,19) or about 15 m (50 ft) (9,12). The largest southern redcedar recorded by the American Forestry Association was 21 m (70 ft) tall and 145 cm (57 in) in d.b.h. in 1976 (10). Some of the virgin timber along Apalachee Bay in Florida may have been more than 30 m (100 ft) tall (3,4). Perhaps the second-growth timber of this long-lived species has not yet reached its mature height on its best sites. Rooting Habit- The species has been reported to have a shallow root system (17). Reaction to Competition- Brief statements in the literature, plus observations, indicate that southern redcedar can become established and will grow in sun or partial shade. Competition, however, may retard reestablishment of cedar-dominated maritime forests because of the dense shade cast by live oaks and associated hardwoods. Southern redcedar, like eastern redcedar, is classed as intolerant to very intolerant of shade. The fact that southern redcedar often grows on the margins of tidal marshes indicates that it is fairly tolerant of salt spray, wind, and flooding (1,12,17). Damaging Agents- Fire is deleterious to this thin-barked species, but the forest cover type Southern Redcedar, which is generally found on sea islands or immediately inland from salt marshes of the mainland, rarely experiences fire. Farther inland, where southern redcedar occurs as a minor species and fires are more frequent, it suffers damage and mortality. Fire damage may be less prevalent now than in the past. Control of wildfires has allowed eastern redcedar to come back to sites within its natural range where it has not existed for a long time (18), and conditions are similar for southern redcedar within its natural range. Cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) attacks southern redcedar (6), and bagworms (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) have been observed feeding on its foliage. Other agents that damage eastern redcedar, such as cedar blight (Phomopsis juniperovora) and various wood rots (15), probably damage southern redcedar also.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,14,1
"Southern redcedar is mostly restricted to the nearly flat outer Coastal Plain, so its establishment and growth in relation to topographic factors are not well understood. Along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, southern redcedar is associated with limestone outcroppings and Indian shell middens bordering tidal marshes, and on sea islands on the leeward side of dunes, where salt spray is minimal. On the Gulf Coast, the species often is found in a narrow zone between the tidal marsh and the pine flatwoods (7). Also along the Gulf Coast, it often colonizes dredge spoil islands (3). Inland from the coast, scattered individuals of the species can be found from the broad, flat ridges between streams to the flood plains of these streams. In areas of abandoned rice fields in South Carolina, the species is found more frequently on the tops and sides of the old dikes than in the poorly drained flats between them. The natural range of southern redcedar includes soils belonging to the orders of Alfisols, Entisols, Inceptisols, Spodosols, and Ultisols (14). Redcedars usually are found on soils that are moist or wet, but not saturated. In general, the species appears to prefer sites of high base saturation, as indicated by its presence near sources of limestone or on Alfisols.",Soils and Topography,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,15,1
"Southern redcedar lumber is used in the manufacture of chests, wardrobes, closet linings, flooring, and scientific instruments. Because the heartwood of redcedar is very resistant to decay, it is used for fence posts (16). Young southern redcedars are sold as Christmas trees (2). Junipers, including southern redcedar, furnish fruit, browse, and protective and nesting cover for many species of wildlife (8). In landscaping, southern redcedar is used as a background, windbreak, or hedge in parks and along roadsides or around homes (1,2). Although usually found on moist soil, it will grow in dry, sandy, or rocky land, and this hardiness, plus its salt tolerance, makes it desirable for ocean bluffs and seaside plantings.",Special Uses,Southern Redcedar,juniperus,silicicola,conifer,16,1
"Spruce pine is not commonly found in pure stands. More often it is established in the shade of hardwoods such as magnolia (Magnolia spp.), gum (Nyssa spp.), hickory (Carya spp.), beech (Fagus spp.), and oak (Quercus spp.), where it may eventually overtop them. The forest cover types in which spruce pine is included (5) are Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 80), Loblolly Pine (Type 81), Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82), Slash Pine (Type 84), and Slash Pine-Hardwood (Type 85). Other trees with which it is associated include pine (Pinus spp.), elm (Ulmus spp.), holly (Ilex spp.), cherry (Prunus spp.), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), fringetree (Chionanthus virginicus), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), red maple (Acer rubrum), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), pondcypress (Taxodium distichum var. nutans), loblolly-bay (Gordonia lasianthus), southern redcedar (Juniperus silicicola), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), redbay (Persea borbonia), and sweetleaf (Symplocos tinctoria).

"In the Southeastern United States where spruce pine grows, the climate is characterized by long, hot, humid summers and mild winters. Annual rainfall is about 1270 mm (50 in), which is normally distributed about evenly throughout the year. Fall tends to be the driest season but summer droughts can occur.

Wood specific gravity showed no trends in any of the four compass directions over the range. A few trees on plots near the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts had higher specific gravities (0.44 to 0.50) than did those inland (0.40 to 0.46) (20). Spruce pine has been successfully crossed with shortleaf pine but only when the latter was the female parent (1). No natural hybrids have been reported.,Genetics,Spruce Pine,pinus,glabra,conifer,7,1
"Although spruce pine is considered a minor southern yellow pine species, it grows in a wide band across the South. It can be found on the low coastal areas from the valley of the lower Santee River in eastern South Carolina, south to the middle of northwest Florida, and west to the valley of Pearl River in eastern Louisiana (14). The natural range lies between latitudes 29° to 33° N. and longitudes 78° to 91° W. (2). - The native range of spruce pine.",Native Range,Spruce Pine,pinus,glabra,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Spruce pine trees generally begin producing cones by age 10. They are most prolific between the ages of 20 to 40 years (14). The trees are monoecious, with pollen cones on weaker branches below the seed cones. First-year seed conelets appear in March in the northern parts of its distribution in Mississippi and somewhat earlier farther south. Seed Production and Dissemination- Second-year cones mature during September and October and seeds are disseminated during November. When ripe, cones are green and have a specific gravity of 0.88. Test results show seeds are mature and germinable when the cones float in SAE 20-weight motor oil. Filled seeds sink in absolute ethanol, and empty or partially filled seeds float. Cleaned seeds are small, ranging from 88,180 to 114,640/kg (40,000 to 52,000/lb) and average 101,410/kg (46,000/lb). Seeds at a moisture content of between 5 and 10 percent have been stored for as long as 10 years at -17.8° to -15.0° C (0° to 5° F) and remained viable (16). Seedling Development- Seeds are not highly viable if the trees are isolated and poorly pollinated. Stratification improves seed germination (11). Sixty percent germination can usually be attained after only 7 days of stratification at 4° C (39° F) (3); however, the recommended cold stratification regime is 0.6° to 5.0° C (33° to 41° F) for 28 days (16). Germination is epigeal (16). Seedlings develop well in shade of hardwoods and other pines, forming a wide-spreading, lateral taproot near the surface before penetrating deep into the soil (14). When it invades old or cleared fields it may become established in the shade of loblolly and shortleaf pines (10). Natural inoculation with mycorrhizae is highly beneficial to seedling establishment (3). Vegetative Reproduction- There is no published information on spruce pine vegetative reproduction. The species has been used experimentally as a rootstock for loblolly pine scions. Seed cone reproduction was greater when spruce pine was the rootstock than when loblolly pine was the rootstock (15).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Spruce Pine,pinus,glabra,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Spruce pine is one of the larger eastern North American pines, reaching a maximum of 38.1 m (125 ft) in height and 122 cm. (48 in) in d.b.h. They are full grown at 60 to 75 years, and as a scattered tree, often grow to a height of 27.4 to 30.5 m (90 to 100 ft) with a d.b.h. of 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) (8). The largest living spruce pine presently recorded measures 128 cm (50.3 in) in d.b.h. and 37.5 m (123 ft) in height. In a stand environment, spruce pine self-prunes to a height of 15.2 to 18.3 m (50 to 60 ft) (14). Its greatest commercial importance is in Louisiana, south Alabama, and Mississippi, where 80 percent of the standing volume is found (18). Although it is not of great importance regionally, it can support a small, local forest industry. Some spruce pine has been planted on a small scale in South Carolina (4). The volume of growing stock on commercial forest land is estimated at 13 131 000 m³ (464 million ft³) and the volume of sawtimber at 56 600 000 m³ (2 billion ft³). Little growth and yield data are available, but estimates of different growth rates have been made on 12 trees in fast growth sites and 12 trees in slow ones within the natural range (table 1) (8). Rooting Habit- Spruce pine has a moderately deep taproot augmented by numerous moderately deep lateral roots. Reaction to Competition- Little is known about spruce pine's ability to compete for minerals and water. Although it is classed as very shade tolerant, it is a slow grower under heavy competition. When planted with sweetgum and Shumard oak (Q. shumardii) on a bottom land site near Charleston, SC, spruce pine did not perform as well as sweetgum but grew slightly better than the Shumard oak. Seedling survival following the first growing season was similar for all three species (more than 90 percent), but by the end of five growing seasons, herbaceous vine and brush competition effects were reflected in overall survival and growth. Sweetgum had a 91 percent survival and grew best (4.1 m, 13.4 ft) on this site, while Shumard oak demonstrated higher survival than did spruce pine (72 percent vs. 48 percent) but did not grow as well (1.68 m vs. 2.38 m, 5.5 ft vs. 7.8 ft) (19). Because of its shade tolerance, spruce pine may be able to compete successfully on cutover lands where other southern pines are unsuccessful (9). Damaging Agents- Because spruce pine is usually found dispersed, it is less susceptible to insect and disease damage than are the other southern pines. It is immune to infection by Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme (13) and is only known to be susceptible to Cronartium comandrae when planted outside its native range. Similarly, the Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana), can cause severe damage to spruce pine planted outside its range but is not considered a problem within its range (17). A gall mite (Trisetacus floridanus), attacks terminal shoots and causes the formation of galls and shortening of the shoot. No control is known for this insect. Spruce pine at any age is highly susceptible to fire because of its thin bark (6.4 to 9.7 mm; 0.25 to 0.38 in). In the crown the bark is smooth and light gray, becoming darker with slightly irregular, shallow fissures with flat connecting ridges on mature boles. The ridges develop into small, closely appressed, light reddish brown scales. This finely furrowed bark is not at all plated like other southern pines but more closely resembles that of southern red oak.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Spruce Pine,pinus,glabra,conifer,14,1
"Spruce pine grows on acidic sandy loam soils high in organic matter, intermediate between dry sandy soils and alluvial bottom land (3). It grows well on poorly drained areas, often having a high water table, that are intermittently waterlogged, and may be found along stream banks or on rich moist hummocks (6). These soils are most commonly found in the orders Spodosols and Entisols.",Soils and Topography,Spruce Pine,pinus,glabra,conifer,15,1
"Wood of this species is brittle and close-grained, has few resin canals, and is not durable (14). The average shear strength parallel to the grain exceeds that of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and loblolly pine. Other structural features are similar to white fir (Abies concolor). It is low in strength, with a specific gravity of 0.443 (20). The average fiber length is two-thirds of that of other southern pines but pulping characteristics are similar. It can be used as it occurs naturally for pulping operations, although use in large quantities for papermaking might require some operational changes to meet strength requirements (9). Spruce pine responds to treatment with paraquat by producing lightwood, that is, wood soaked with oleoresin. Its response is similar to that of slash pine, and the increase in turpentine produced is proportionately greater than the increase in resin acids (12). Spruce pine is planted to some extent for use as a Christmas tree. Productivity is about half that of the more popular Virginia pine, and two shearings per growing season are a necessity in southeastern Louisiana (7). As a member of mixed pine-hardwood communities it provides some habitat and food for wildlife.",Special Uses,Spruce Pine,pinus,glabra,conifer,16,1
"In the Rocky Mountains, subalpine fir is most typically found in mixture with Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and forms the relatively stable Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206) forest cover type. It is also found in varying degrees in 16 other cover types (56): Differences in elevation and latitude affect temperature and precipitation, influencing the composition of the forests where subalpine fir grows (16). In Alaska and the Coast Range of British Columbia south through the Coast Range of Washington and Oregon, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) is its common associate. In Alaska and northern British Columbia, Alaska-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) mixes with it; and where it approaches sea level, it mingles with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). From southern British Columbia southward through much of the Cascades, Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are the most common associates under closed forest conditions. Major timberline associates are mountain hemlock and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). Engelmann spruce is not a constant associate of subalpine fir except on the east slopes of the northern Cascades, and on exceptionally moist, cool habitats scattered throughout the southern and western Cascades. Engelmann spruce is a major associate of subalpine fir in the mountains of eastern Washington and Oregon. Less common associates in the Pacific Northwest include western hemlock, noble fir (Abies procera), grand fir (Abies grandis), western white pine (Pinus monticola), western larch (Larix occidentalis), and alpine larch (Larix Iyallii) (2,9). From the mountains and interior plateaus of central British Columbia southward through the Rocky Mountain system, where subalpine fir frequently extends to timberline, its most constant associate is Engelmann spruce. Less common associates include: in British Columbia and western Alberta, white spruce (Picea glauca), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), and aspen (Populus tremuloides); in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho at its lower limits, western white pine, interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western larch, grand fir, and western redcedar (Thuja plicata); and at higher elevations, lodgepole pine, alpine larch, mountain hemlock, and whitebark pine. In the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, near its lower limits, associates are lodgepole pine, interior Douglas-fir, aspen, and blue spruce (Picea pungens); and at higher elevations, whitebark pine, limber pine (Pinus flexilis), and bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata); and in the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges of New Mexico and Arizona, near its lower limits, white fir (Abies concolor), interior Douglas-fir, blue spruce, and aspen; and at higher elevations, corkbark fir. Subalpine fir frequently extends to timberline in the Rocky Mountains. Other species that accompany it to timberline are whitebark pine, mountain hemlock, and occasionally Engelmann spruce in the Rocky Mountains north of Utah and Wyoming; Engelmann spruce in the Rocky Mountains north of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado; and Engelmann spruce and corkbark fir in the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges south of Wyoming and Utah (2,9). At timberline in the Rocky Mountains, subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce form a wind Krummholz I to 2 m (3 to 7 ft) high. On gentle slopes below timberline, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and occasionally lodgepole pine grow in north-south strips 10 to 50 m (33 to 164 ft) wide and several hundred meters long approximately at right angles to the direction of prevailing winds. These strips are separated by moist subalpine meadows 25 to 75 m (82 to 246 ft) wide where deep snow drifts accumulate (14). Undergrowth vegetation is more variable than tree associates. In the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges north of Utah and Wyoming, common undergrowth species include: Labrador tea (Ledum glandulosum), Cascades azalea (Rhododendron albiflorum), rusty skunkbrush (Menziesia ferruginea), woodrush (Luzula hitchcockii), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), dwarf huckleberry (Vaccinium caespitosum) and blue huckleberry (V. globulare) (cool, moist sites); queens cup (Clintonia uniflora), twistedstalk (Streptopus amplexiflolius), and sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum) (warm, moist sites); grouse whortleberry (V. scoparium), fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), mountain gooseberry (Ribes montigenum), heartleaf arnica (Arnica cordifolia), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), boxleaf myrtle (Pachystima myrsinites), elksedge (Carex geyeri), and pine grass (Calamagrostis rubescens (cool, dry sites); creeping juniper (Juniperus communis), white spirea (Spiraea betulaefolia), Oregongrape (Berberis repens), a mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), and big whortleberry (V. membranaceum) (warm, dry sites); and marsh-marigold (Caltha biflora), devilsclub (Oplopanax horrida), and bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) (wet sites) (6,22).

Temperatures range from below -45° C (-50° F) in the winter to more than 32.2° C (90° F) in the summer. Although widely distributed, subalpine fir grows within a narrow range of mean temperatures. Mean annual temperatures vary from -3.9° C (25° F) to 4.4° C (40° F), with a July mean of 7.2° C to 15.6° C (45° F to 60° F), and a January mean of -15.0° C to -3.9° C (5° F to 25° F) (10,26,47) (table 1).

More than half the precipitation occurs from late fall to late winter in the Pacific Northwest and west of the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains north of Utah and Wyoming. East of the Divide, in the Rocky Mountains north of New Mexico and Arizona, the heaviest precipitation comes in late winter and early spring. In the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges in Arizona and New Mexico, most precipitation comes during late summer and early fall (5,10,58). However, cool summers, cold winters, and deep winter snowpacks are more important than total precipitation in differentiating where subalpine fir grows in relation to other species.",Climate,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,2,1

Like many species with wide distribution, it has probably developed unknown races and hybrids, and there is some evidence that natural introgressive hybridization between subalpine and balsam fir occurs where they grow together in Canada. Horticultural and ornamental cultures have been recognized (45). These include: 1. Abies lasiocarpa cv beissneri a dwarf tree bearing distorted branches and twisted needles. 2. A. 1. cv coerulescens a beautiful tree with specially intensive bluish needles. 3. A. 1. cv compacta. A dwarf tree of compact habit.",Hybrids,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,9,1
"Subalpine fir is a widely distributed North American fir. Its range extends from 32° N. latitude in Arizona and New Mexico to 64° 30 N. in Yukon Territory, Canada. Along the Pacific coast, the range extends from southeastern Alaska, south of the Copper River Valley (lat. 62° N.), the northwestern limit; east to central Yukon Territory (lat. 64° 30' N.), the northern limit; south through British Columbia along the east slopes of the Coast Range to the Olympic Mountains of Washington, and along both slopes of the Cascades to southern Oregon. It is not found on the west slopes of the Coast Range in southern British Columbia or along the Coast Range in Washington and Oregon, but it does occur on Vancouver Island (219). It is also found locally in northeastern Nevada and northwestern California (43). Except where noted above, subalpine fir is a major component of high elevation Pacific Northwest forests. In the Rocky Mountain region, subalpine fir extends from the interior valleys of British Columbia west of the Continental Divide and south of the Peace River (lat. 55° N.), south along the high elevations of the Rocky Mountain system to southern New Mexico and Arizona. In the north, its range extends from the high mountains of central British Columbia, western Alberta, northeastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, Idaho, Montana, to the Wind River Mountains of western Wyoming. In Utah, it commonly occurs in the Uinta and Wasatch Mountains, but is less abundant on the southern plateaus. The range extends from southern Wyoming, through the high mountains of Colorado and northern New Mexico, and westward through northeastern Arizona to the San Francisco Mountains (2,9). Subalpine fir is a major component of the high-elevation forests of the Rocky Mountains. Corkbark fir is found mixed with subalpine fir on scattered mountains in southwestern Colorado; northern, western, and southwestern New Mexico; and in the high mountains of Arizona (44). - The native range of subalpine fir.",Native Range,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,11,1
"Information on subalpine fir population differences is virtually nonexistent. Undoubtedly, any species with the range in elevation and latitude of subalpine fir will exhibit differences in growth, phenology, dormancy, resistance to heat and cold, etc, among different populations.",Population Differences,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Subalpine fir flowers are monoecious. Male flowers, usually abundant, are borne in pendulous clusters from the axils of the needles on the lower branchlets. Female flowers are fewer, borne erect and singly on the uppermost branchlets of the crown. Male flowers ripen, and pollen is wind-disseminated, during late spring and early summer. Cones are indigo blue when they open in mid-August to mid-October. Seed ripens from mid-September to late-October (45,60). Seed Production and Dissemination- Subalpine fir may begin to produce cones when trees are 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) tall and 20 years old, but under closed-forest conditions, seed production is not significant until trees are older and taller. Corkbark fir does not begin to bear cones until about 50 years old. Maximum seed production for subalpine and corkbark fir occurs in dominant trees 150 to 200 years old (9,60). Subalpine fir is a good seed producer in the Pacific Northwest and in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and Montana, with good to heavy crops borne every 3 years, and light crops or failures in between (24,42). It is as good a seed producer as most associated true firs, but not as good as the hemlocks and Engelmann spruce. In one 11-year study at four locations in the Cascades, subalpine fir cone crops, based on the following criteria, were rated medium to very heavy in 6 years and very light to failure in the other 5 (24). In the Rocky Mountains south of Idaho and Montana, seed production of subalpine and corkbark fir has generally been poor, with more failures than good seed years. In one study in Colorado covering 42 area-seed-crop years, subalpine fir was an infrequent seed producer. Some seed was produced in only 8 of the years, while the other 34 were complete failures (50). Similar results have been obtained from other seed-production studies in Colorado. However, because these studies were designed to sample seed production in spruce-fir stands and because Engelmann spruce made up 90 percent or more of the dominant stand basal area, these results only indicate subalpine fir seed production in spruce-fir stands, not of individual dominant fir trees (9). A number of cone and seed insects of subalpine fir have been identified but their relative importance, frequency of occurrence, and the magnitude of losses are not known (39). Some seed is lost from cutting and storing of cones by pine squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus fremonti), and, after seed is shed, small mammals, such as deer mice (Clethrionomys gapperi), mountain voles (Microtus montanus), and western chipmunks (Eutamias minimus), consume some seeds (5). However, the amount of seed lost to mammals, birds, and other causes are not known. Cones disintegrate when they are ripe. Scales fall away with the large, winged seeds, leaving only a central, spikelike axis. Dissemination beginning in September usually is completed by the end of October in the Rocky Mountains. In the Pacific Northwest, seed dissemination begins in October and usually continues into November, but pitched-up cones may extend dissemination into December. Nearly all seed is dispersed by the wind (21,60). Subalpine fir seeds are fairly large, averaging 76,720/kg (34,800/lb). Little information is available on seed dispersal distances. Studies designed to measure Engelmann spruce seed dispersal show similar dispersal patterns for subalpine fir. Prevailing winds influence the dispersal pattern, with about half the seeds falling into openings within 30 m (100 ft) of the windward timber edge. Seedfall continues to diminish until about two-thirds the way across the opening, and then levels off before slightly increasing about 15 m (50 ft) from the leeward timber edge (50). Thermal upslope winds are important in seed dispersal in mountainous terrain at mid- to lower-elevations (54). Subalpine fir seed viability is only fair: average germinative capacity is 34 percent and vitality transient (60). Observations and limited studies in the Rocky Mountains indicate that germinative capacity is often less than 30 percent (55). Some lots of stored seeds exhibit embryo dormancy, which can be broken by stratification in moist sand or peat at 5° C (41° F) for 60 days (9,60). Seedling Development- Under natural conditions, fir seeds lie dormant under the snow and germinate the following spring. Although germination and early survival of subalpine fir are generally best on exposed mineral soil and moist humus, the species is less exacting in its seedbed requirements than most of its common associates. Subalpine fir has been observed to germinate and survive on a wide variety of other seedbed types including the undisturbed forest floor, undecomposed duff and litter, and decaying wood (9,15,19). Subalpine fir also invades and establishes on severe sites such as recent bums, lava flows, talus slopes, avalanche tracks, and climatically severe regions near timberline (22). Subalpine fir succeeds on these open sites because of its ability to establish a root system under conditions too severe for its less hardy associates, and its ability to reproduce by layering. Although subalpine fir grows under nearly all light intensities found in nature, establishment and early survival are usually favored by shade. In the absence of Pacific silver fir, grand fir, and mountain hemlock, subalpine fir will survive under closed-forest conditions with less light than Engelmann spruce, noble fir, and white spruce (22). When grown with Pacific silver and grand fir, and/or mountain hemlock, subalpine fir does not compete successfully under closed-forest conditions. It does not compete well with the spruces, lodgepole pine, or interior Douglas-fir when light intensity exceeds 50 percent of full shade (9). Subalpine fir is restricted to cold, humid habitats because of low tolerance to high temperatures. Newly germinated subalpine fir seedlings tolerate high solar radiation, but they are susceptible to heat girdling and drought. Seedlings are also killed or damaged by spring frosts, competing vegetation, frost heaving, damping off, snowmold, birds, rodents, and trampling and browsing by large animals, but losses are not different than for any common associate (5). The number of seeds required to produce a first-year seedling, and an established seedling (at least 3 years old), and the number of first-year seedlings that produce an established seedling vary considerably, depending upon seed production, distance from source, seedbed, and other environmental conditions. In one study in Colorado, covering the period 1961 to 1975 and a wide variety of conditions, an average of 150 seeds (range 35 to 290) was required to produce a first-year seedling. An average of 755 seeds (range 483 to 1,016) was required to produce a 4- to 13-year-old established seedling. For every established 4- to 13-year-old seedling, an average of 10 first-year seedlings were required, with a range of as few as 4 to as many as 14 (50). Early root growth of subalpine fir is very slow. The root length of first-year seedlings in one study in British Columbia averaged only 6.8 cm (2.7 in) (20). No comparable data are available in the United States, but first-year penetration of corkbark fir in Arizona averaged 8.6 cm (3.4 in) (32). Shoot growth is equally slow at high elevations. Many first-year seedlings are less than 2.5 cm (I in) tall. Annual height growth of seedlings during the first 10-15 years usually averages less than 2.5 cm (1 in). In one study, seedlings 15 years old averaged only 28 cm (11 in) in height on burned-over slopes, 25 cm (10 in) on cutover, dry slopes, and 15 cm (6 in) on cutover, wet flats (30). In another study, seedlings grown on mineral soil averaged only 58.8 cm (24 in) after 21 years (28). Trees reach 1.2 to 1.5 m (4 to 5 ft) in height in 20 to 40 years under favorable environmental conditions. However, trees less than 13 cm (5 in) in diameter are often 100 or more years old at higher elevations, and trees 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft) high and 35 to 50 years old are common under closed-forest conditions (40,51). At lower elevations, seedling shoot growth has been better. In one study in the Intermountain West, average annual height growth of subalpine fir seedlings for the first 10 years after release was 11.4 cm (4.5 in) on clearcuts and 8.1 cm (3.2 in) on partial cuts (48). Vegetative Reproduction- Subalpine fir frequently reproduces by layering where the species is a pioneer in developing forest cover on severe sites such as lava flows and talus slopes or near timberline (22). Under closed-forest conditions, reproduction by layering is of minor importance.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- On exposed sites near timberline, subalpine fir is often reduced to a prostrate shrub, but under closed-forest conditions it attains diameters of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) and heights of 14 to 30 m (45 to 100 ft), depending upon site quality and stand density. Trees larger than 76 cm (30 in) in diameter and 39.6 m (130 ft) in height are exceptional (57). Growth is not rapid; trees 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in) in diameter are often 150 to 200 years old under closed-forest conditions. Trees older than 250 years are not uncommon. But, because the species suffers severely from heartrot, many trees either die or are complete culls at an early age. Few data are available on the yields of subalpine fir in natural stands. It usually grows in mixed stands and comprises only a minor part of the volume. In the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, where it grows in association with Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir usually makes up only 10 to 20 percent of the saw log volume, which may range from less than 12,350 to more than 98,800 fbm/ha (5,000 to 40,000 fbm/acre) (30,49). In the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains, where subalpine fir grows with other true firs and/or mountain hemlock, few trees reach minimum merchantable size before being crowded out of the stand (22). Subalpine fir in the Rocky Mountains grows in pure stands most often on sites so severe that it has little commercial value. In the Pacific Northwest, pure stands on commercial sites typically occur on southerly slopes and are usually less than 150 years old. These stands are not extensive but are distinctive (21).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,14,1
"Information on soils where subalpine fir grows is limited. In the Pacific Coast region, soil parent materials are mixed and varied. Zonal soils in the subalpine fir zone are Cryorthods (Podzolic soils), or Haplorthods (Brown Podzolic soils) with well developed but ultimately thin humus layers. Haploxerults and Haplohumults (Reddish-Brown Lateritic soils), developed from volcanic lava; Xerochrepts (Regosolic soils), developed from shallow residual material; and Lithic (Lithosolic soils) are also common in some localities. Dystrandepts (Bog soils) and Haplaquepts (Humic Gley soils) occur on poorly drained sites. Soils are more acid than in lower elevation forests, with pH typically ranging from 4.5 to 5.9 (22,61). In the central and southern Rocky Mountains subalpine zone, soil materials vary according to the character of the bedrock from which they originated. Crystalline granite rock predominates, but conglomerates, shales, sandstones, basalts, and andesites commonly occur. Glacial deposits and stream alluvial fans are also common along valley bottoms. Of the great soils group, Cryorthods (Podzolic Soils) and Haplorthods (Brown Podzolic Soils) occur extensively on all aspects. Cryochrepts (Sols Bruns Acides) occur extensively on the drier aspects. Aquods (Ground-Water Podzolic Soils) are found in the more poorly drained areas. Cryoboralfs (Gray-Wooded Soils) have fine-textured parent material and support low-density timber stands. Haploboralls (Brown Forest Soils) occur mostly in the lower subalpine zone along stream terraces and side slopes. Lithics (Lithosolic Soils) occur whenever bedrock is near the surface. Aquepts (Bog Soils) and Haplaquepts (Humic Gley Soils) occur extensively in poorly drained upper stream valleys (31,61). Regardless of the great soils groups that occur in the subalpine zone of the west, subalpine fir is not exacting in its soil requirements. It is frequently found growing on soils that are too wet or too dry for its common associates. Good growth is made on lower slopes, alluvial floodplains, and glacial moraines; and at high elevations on well drained, fine- to medium-textured sand and silt loams that developed primarily from basalt, andesite, and shale. Growth is poor on shallow and coarse-textured soils developed from granitic and schistic rock, conglomerates, and coarse sandstones, and on saturated soils, but subalpine fir establishes on severe sites, such as lava beds, tallus slopes, and avalanche tracks, before any of its common associates. Under these conditions it may pioneer the site for other species or it may exclude the establishment of other species (9,23). Subalpine fir grows near sea level at the northern limit of its range, and as high as 3658 m (12,000 ft) in the south. In the Coast Range of southeastern Alaska, it is found from sea level to 1067 m (3,500 ft); in the Coast Range and interior plateaus of Yukon Territory and British Columbia, at 610 to 1524 m (2,000 to 5,000 ft); and in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, generally at 1219 to 1829 m (4,000 to 6,000 ft), but as low as 610 m (2,000 ft) along cold stream bottoms and on lava flows, and as high as 2438 m (8,000 ft) on sheltered slopes (9,57). In the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta south of the Peace River, subalpine fir grows at 914 to 2134 m (3,000 to 7,000 ft), but it is more abundant above 1524 m (5,000 ft); in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho and associated ranges in eastern Washington and Oregon, at 610 to 3353 m (2,000 to 11,000 ft), but it is more common at 1524 to 2743 m (5,000 to 9,000 ft) (40,41); in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, usually at 2743 to 3353 m (9,000 to 11,000 ft), but it may be found as low as 2438 m (8,000 ft) and to timberline at 3505 m (11,500 ft); and in the Rocky Mountains and associated ranges of New Mexico and Arizona, at 2438 to 3658 m (8,000 to 12,000 ft), but usually on north slopes at 2896 to 3353 m (9,500 to 11,000 ft) (9,12,46,52).",Soils and Topography,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,15,1
"Throughout much of the Rocky Mountains, subalpine fir has no special or unique properties. In the high Cascades and in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and Montana, it is a forest pioneer on severe and disturbed sites. By providing cover, subalpine fir assists in protecting watersheds and rehabilitating the landscape. Forests in which subalpine fir grows occupy the highest water yield areas in much of the West. The species also provides habitat for various game and nongame animals, forage for livestock, recreational opportunities, and scenic beauty. However, these properties are indigenous to the sites where subalpine fir grows rather than to any special properties associated with the species (1,5). Fir is used as lumber in building construction, boxes, crates, planing mill products, sashes, doors, frames, and food containers. It has not been widely used for pulpwood because of inaccessibility, but it can be pulped readily by the sulfate, sulfite, or groundwood processes (59).",Special Uses,Subalpine Fir,abies,lasiocarpa,conifer,16,1

"Sugar maple is a genetically variable tree. Some botanists recognize from three to six varieties or forma that differ in morphological characteristics, but others consider them to be subspecies. Extensive research indicates a ""flow of characteristics"" over the wide geographic distribution and variation in habitat conditions (30,64). Kriebel indicated that sugar maples could be grouped into three major geographic races or ecotypes, each containing a parallel clinal variation (30). Provenance tests in his study indicate differences in drought endurance, resistance to leaf injury from high insolation, and phenological behavior. Most of the genetic work in sugar maple is currently confined to improving maple syrup (27) and developing ornamental trees (49,62,119). Nurserymen rely mostly on budding and some grafting for vegetative propagation. Bird's-eye grain trees have been grafted since the early 1960's but results are not available for propagation of this characteristic (63). The USDA Forest Service, in recent work, has selected 228 superior sugar maple trees and established three plantations with 126 families (43). Hybrids have been reported between sugar maple and black and red maples (30). Hybrid seedlings have been obtained by pollinating sugar maple with another maple (presumably Acer macrophyllum) (30).",Genetics,Sugar Maple,acer,saccharum,hardwood,7,0
"The northern limit of sugar maple nearly parallels the 35th mean annual isotherm extending eastward from the extreme southeast corner of Manitoba, through central Ontario, the southern third of Quebec and all of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Within the United States the species is found throughout New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and the middle Atlantic States, extending southwestward through central New Jersey to the Appalachian Mountains, then southward through the western edge of North Carolina to the southern border of Tennessee. The western limit extends through Missouri into a small area of Kansas, the eastern one-third of Iowa, and the eastern two-thirds of Minnesota. A few outlier communities are found in northern Kansas, Georgia, and the Carolinas. - The native range of sugar maple. Sugar maple is restricted to regions with cool, moist climates. In northern areas, January temperatures average about -18° C (0° F) and July temperatures about 16° C (60° F). In the southern portions of the range, January temperatures average about 10° C (50° F) and July temperatures approach 27° C (80°F), although moisture and aspect influence these extremes. In the sugar maple region, typical ranges in temperatures are from -40° C (-40° F) in the north to 38° C (100° F) in the southwestern areas. Occasional extremes may be more than 11 C (20° F) lower or higher than these. Precipitation averages range from about 510 mm (20 in) annually near the western edge of the range to 2030 mm (80 in) in the southern Appalachians. Much of the northeastern region receives about 1270 mm (50 in) per year where substantial commercial volumes of sugar maple are located. In general, the growing season precipitation is well distributed and averages 380 mm (15 in) in the western areas and 1020 mm (40 in) in the East. Snowfall often exceeds 2540 mm (100 in) in the northern portion of the range. In the broad geographic area covered by sugar maple, the growing season ranges from 80 to 260 days. The last killing frost usually occurs from March 20 to June 15 and the first killing frost occurs between September 1 and November 10. In mountainous areas of the Northeast, climatic factors largely determine the upper elevation limits of the species(97). Sugar maple grows on a wide variety of sites ranging from a site index of about 12 m (40 ft) to nearly 24 m (80 ft) at age 50 (12,17,21,25,46,91). Typical good quality second-growth stands usually fall between site index 17 and 20 m (55 and 65 ft) for sugar maple at base age 50 years. Height growth is slower after age 50 in the eastern regions. Except on the best sites, the depth of the soil and type of parent material has a marked influence on site index (69). Sugar maple grows on sands, loamy sands, sandy loams, loams, and silt loams but it does best on well-drained loams (30). It does not grow well on dry, shallow soils and is rarely, if ever, found in swamps (30). Sugar maple is soil-site specific in southerly regions but abundant on a wide variety of soils in the northern Lake States. It is mostly found on Spodosols, Alfisols, and Mollisols among the soil orders. In New Hampshire, sugar maple is associated with sites that have abundant organic matter (69), and in West Virginia it is most abundant on areas with high oak site indices (107). Sugar maple grows on soils ranging from strongly acid (pH 3.7) to slightly alkaline (pH 7.3), but it most commonly grows on soils with a pH of from 5.5 to 7.3 (30). The heavy leaf litter typical of sugar maple tends to modify the pH and nutrient status of the soil. The leaves contain about 1.81 percent calcium, 0.24 percent magnesium, 0.75 percent potassium, 0.11 percent phosphorus, 0.67 percent nitrogen, and 11.85 percent ash, based on dry weight. The pH of leaves ranges from 4.0 to 4.9. The calcium content remains relatively uniform in trees growing with a pH range of 4.5 to 7.0 but drops as the soils become more acid (5). In the Lake States, sugar maple is found at elevations up to 490 m (1,600 ft)-most commonly on ridges between poorly drained areas and on soil with at least 1 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft) to the water table. In northern New England and New York State it grows at elevations up to 760 m (2,500 ft). In the Green Mountains of Vermont and the White Mountains of New Hampshire, especially, the upper limit lies in a sharp horizontal band with a narrow transitional zone into the Boreal forest types. In the southern Appalachians the upper elevation ranges from 910 m (3,000 ft) to 1680 m (5,500 ft), with the lower levels generally restricted to the cooler north slopes. In the southern and southwestern parts of its range, sugar maple more typically grows on moist flats and along ravines at intermediate elevations in the rolling topography.",Habitat,Sugar Maple,acer,saccharum,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Sugar maple trees seldom flower until they are at least 22 years old; flowering is heavier at later ages. The flower buds usually begin to swell at or slightly before the leaf buds show activity and reach full bloom 1 to 2 weeks before leaves emerge. Flowers appear between late March and mid-May, depending on the geographic location (85). Flowering in sugar maple is polygamous, occurring over the entire crown. The long-pedicelled, apetalous yellow flowers, about 6.4 cm (2.5 in) long, seem to be perfect, but usually only one sex is functional within each flower. Both sexes are typically produced in the upper part of the crown but only males form in the lower part (26). In some trees, certain major limbs produce only male and others only female flowers. The flowers of sugar maple were thought to be bee-pollinated (30,64), but a recent study showed that pollination occurs freely in sugar maple without the aid of insects (28). The fruit, a double samara, ripens in about 16 weeks. Usually only one of the paired samaras is filled with a single seed, typically averaging 7 to 9 mm (0.3 to 0.4 in) in length, but occasionally both samaras will contain seed or both will be empty. Some trees produce triple samaras and others produce samaras with double wings. Samaras collected from trees having the bird's-eye wood grain characteristic showed a consistency of overlapping of the wings, a strong union between samaras, and lighter colored wings after drying but these characteristics have not been confirmed as being an attribute associated with bird's-eye (32). Seeds are mature when the samaras turn yellowish green and have a moisture content less than 145 percent (11,124). The samaras begin falling about 2 weeks after they ripen, usually just before the leaves fall. Seed Production and Dissemination- The fruit of sugar maple is intermediate in size among species within the genus. Samaras average about 15,400/kg (7,000/lb), but range from 7.060 20,070/kg (3,200 to 9,100/lb) (85). The large papery wings, typically 20 to 27 mm (0.8 to 1.1 in) in length and 7 to 11 mm (0.3 to 0.4 in) wide, permit the samara to be carried at least 100 m (330 ft) by the wind. During a good seed year in northern Michigan, 173,000 samaras per hectare (70,000/acre) fell in the center of a 4-ha (10-acre) clearcut (31). Samaras containing seed can be readily separated from empty samaras by immersion in N-pentane. Immersion up to 1 hour may delay germination but has no effect on seed viability (124). Light fruit crops are produced by 40- to 60-year-old trees with 20 cm (8 in) d.b.h., and moderate crops by 70- to 100-year-old trees with 25- to 36-cm (10- to14-in) d.b.h. Saw-log-size trees produce vast numbers of samaras. During an excellent fruiting year in northern Michigan, a series of traps caught 22 million/ha (8.56 million/acre) sugar maple samaras in a virgin stand and 11 million/ha (4.3 million/acre) in a selectively cut stand (30). Based on 32 years of observation in northcentral Wisconsin, good or better fruit crops occurred about 44 percent of the years, the lowest percentage among the major hardwood species of the area (37;40). Good or better fruit crops occurred as often as 4 successive years, but successive poor crops did not extend longer than 2 years. The period between good or better crops ranges from 1 to 4 years in north-central Wisconsin, from 2 to 5 years in other portions of the United States, and from 3 to 7 years in Canada(30,47; 115). To germinate, sugar maple seeds require moist stratification at temperatures slightly above freezing for 35 to 90 days. Each sugar maple seed seems to have its own stratification-period threshold, short of which the epigeal germination process ceases (126). Both moisture content and temperature affect how long seeds can be stored. Under proper conditions seeds have been stored for at least 5 years without loss of viability (10). In natural stands, few if any seeds remain viable on the forest floor beyond the first year (73). Sugar maple seed has an extremely high germination capacity, with averages of 95 percent or more (126). The optimum temperature for germination is about 1° C (34° F), the lowest of any known forest species (39,108). Germination drops rapidly as temperatures increase, and little if any germination occurs above 10° C (50° F). Rapid warming of the surface soil in the spring of 1978 in northern Wisconsin, for example, prevented germination from the bumper seed crop of 1977, except in a few remaining snowbanks along the roads (38). Under natural conditions the cotyledon leaves are out and growing before the snow is gone in the northern regions. This unique characteristic of germination at low temperatures probably accounts for the abundance of sugar maple regeneration under most stand conditions in the north. Another major characteristic of the germinating sugar maple seed is its vigorous development of a strong radicle that has the strength and length to penetrate heavy leaf litter and reach mineral soil during the moist period. Seedling Development- Seedlings of sugar maple are very shade tolerant and can survive long periods of suppression. In a study of seedling height for 5 years after germination under low lath shade in central Ontario, the tallest seedlings were found under about 65 percent shade, averaging about 127 cm (50 in) tall (34,71). Heights were greater than 102 cm (40 in) from about 35 to 90 percent of full sunlight, with average heights decreasing at more open and heavier shading. A significant finding in this study was that supplemental watering was necessary for survival at more than 55 percent of full sunlight. Dry weight and root development were little affected by the level of light. A Vermont study of shade levels showed no significant difference in seedlings grown under 0, 30, and 60 percent shade but found a marked decrease in development under 90 percent shade. Seedlings grown under the different shade treatments showed no difference, however, in either height or diameter growth 4 years after field planting (125). Sugar maple roots release an exudate that can inhibit the growth of yellow birch when the root growth periods coincide, thus gaining a growth advantage over one of its associated species (110). Other tree species may be similarly affected. Aster and goldenrod exert an allelopathic effect on sugar maple by reducing germination and early growth of seedlings (24). The growth of understory seedlings begins before the overstory leafs out, generally about mid-May in Upper Michigan. About 90 percent of the seasonal height growth occurs within 18 days under dense stands and 24 days in the open (50). The major growth of other species studied extended about three times longer. Seedling numbers greater than 370,500/ha (150,000/acre) are common, although as many as 50 percent of the new seedlings may not survive the first year. Seedlings in the understory of young, dense stands may not survive for more than 5 years but many of the seedlings under stands averaging 25 cm (10 in) d.b.h. or more will persist, although they will have little annual height growth until released. In a study of reproduction in old growth stands cut to various basal area densities, number of seedlings per hectare did not differ significantly at either 2 or 5 years after cutting. After 10 years, seedlings under the lightest overstories (6.9 m²/ha or 30 ft²/acre) grew most rapidly although seedlings were abundant under all overstory densities (109). In the drier Lake States region, natural seedlings must have overstory shade for survival until they reach 0.6 to 1.2 m (2 to 4 ft) in height, at which time their root systems have developed from the litter-mineral soil interface into mineral soil. The entire overstory can then be removed with high seedling survival and full stocking (42). Removing the over-story before seedlings are established usually results in semipermanent wildlife openings in the Lake States (112). In partially cut stands, the tallest seedlings usually develop and constitute the trees of the new stand as the overstory is gradually removed(78). Planting or other special regenerative measures are rarely needed for sugar maple in New England or the Lake States where the tree grows naturally. In other regions, sugar maple is less aggressive and planting is a desirable practice. Nursery stock used in planting is usually fall sown at a depth of about 6 mm (0.25 in) and covered with about 6 mm (0.25 in) of sawdust. The nursery bed is covered by about 50 percent lath shade. Sowing density should yield about 130 to 160 seedlings per square meter (12 to 15 seedlings/ft²) and seedlings should be vertically root pruned before lifting, usually as 2-0 stock (101,121,124). On more difficult sites 3-0 stock is preferred with tops averaging about 25 cm (10 in) or about twice the height of 2-0 seedlings (101). Open field plantings with sugar maple have a high survival rate, but seedlings grow poorly because of their inability to compete for moisture and nutrients with herbaceous vegetation. Generally, open field plantings require good stock and several years of site maintenance to assure success (114,127). Time of planting is important. Survival and growth can be vastly improved by planting very early in the spring compared to planting late in the spring. The increase is attributed to the greater root regeneration capabilities during that time (118). Fall plantings have been highly successful in Vermont (127). Sugar maple must be planted at relatively close spacings in order to correct the forking problems that result from the frequent loss of the terminal bud in this opposite-branched species (78,89). Vegetative Reproduction-Sugar maple reproduces by stump sprouts and will occasionally layer (22). Root suckering is rare. Seedlings broken during logging readily sprout from dormant buds on the lower bole and quickly regain the height of undamaged seedlings (52). Initial deformities, primarily crook, and stem losses from deer browsing are rapidly overgrown and corrected without development of internal rot (51). In older stands, the percentage of stumps sprouting decreases with increase in tree size, stand density, and years since cutting. Two years after a cutting in northern Michigan, the most sprouting occurred on 15-cm (6-in) trees and the least sprouting on 76-cm (30-in) trees. The percent of stumps sprouting averaged 94 and 38, respectively. Five years after cutting, the percent of sprouting dropped to about 58 and 6, respectively. The number of sprouts per stump also declined with years since cutting (30). Sugar maple is a prolific sprouter in the North, but it sprouts less than other hardwood species in the southern part of its range (9,86,88,99). Cuttings of sugar maple can be rooted but may later fail due to poor overwintering survival. Cuttings can be successfully overwintered by forcing the cutting to break bud and produce a flush of new growth immediately after it roots with the use of gibberellic acid (128). Rooting response varies greatly between clones-differences range from 0 to 100 percent, and rooting response tends to be consistent from year to year. Timing the collection of cuttings is critical; those taken in mid-June generally give the best results. A rooting medium consisting of a 1 to 1 mixture of perlite and sphagnum moss, with intermittent misting, has worked well with sugar maple cuttings. The reliability of cuttings to propagate trees with figured wood, such as curly grain and bird's-eye, has not been verified (30). Sugar maple trees with desirable genetic characteristics can be reproduced by grafting. Success with this method can be highly variable depending to a large degree on grafting techniques, that is, when and under what conditions the scions were collected and handled, treatment of the rootstock, and experience of the grafters (129). Of the various methods available, bud grafting is used most commonly and with a high degree of success by commercial nurserymen (64). Air-layering, a method of propagation that stimulates root development on branches still attached to the parent tree, is another method that has been successfully used (16). A major disadvantage of this procedure is that branches on some trees selected for propagation may not be readily accessible.",Life History,Sugar Maple,acer,saccharum,hardwood,10,0
"Growth and Yield- Early growth of sugar maple is slow, partly because it regenerates under heavy shade. In natural stands, the younger seedlings are sensitive to surface moisture conditions because they have a shallow, fibrous root system that lies between the litter-mineral soil interface of typical podzols. With a gradual increase in light, the root systems penetrate deeper into the mineral soil and height growth increases. Growth during the pole stage is slower than for most associated hardwood species. Height and radial growth begins at about the same time as the buds leaf out. Height growth is completed in about 15 weeks and radial growth in from 14 to 17 weeks, depending on the season and locality (30). In some areas, height growth is about 85 percent complete within 5 weeks and cambial growth is about 80 percent complete in 8 weeks (30). In the Lake States, older sugar maple trees (fig. 3) in a mature stand grew 2.5 cm (1 in) d.b.h. in 10 years (30). Maximum diameter growth rates of individual trees in mature stands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were about 7.6 cm (3 in) per decade for 46-cm (18-in) trees, 8.9 cm (3.5 in) for 30-cm (12-in) trees, and 10.2 cm (4 in) for 15-cm (6-in) trees (15). Growth in second-growth stands, however, generally exceeds 5.1 cm (2 in) in 10 years for saw-log-size trees (18) and a maximum rate in excess of 10.2 cm (4 in) has been reported (106). For the first 30 to 40 years, sugar maples average about 30 cm (12 in) a year in height growth. Mature trees and stands of sugar maple reach 300 to 400 years of age, 27 to 37 m (90 to 120 ft) in height, and 76- to 91-cm (30- to 36-in) in d.b.h. (30). Following repeated cutting under the uneven-aged system, age and diameter show strong linear relation with the older ages, seldom exceeding 250 years (68,111). Height growth usually ceases or becomes negligible at about 140 to 150 years (30). Diameter growth continues at a decreasing rate with age and size. The largest reported sugar maple tree, growing near Kitzmiller, MD, has a d.b.h. of 209 cm (82.1 in), is 23.8 m (78 ft) tall, and has a crown spread of 20.1 m (66 ft) (1). Yields of mixed hardwood stands, but predominantly sugar maple, range up to a maximum of 216 m3/ha (14,000 gross board feet/acre) (30,70). Yields for northern hardwood stands in the Lake States are available from estimates of average stand age and average stand diameter (table 1). Both parameters are based on overstory trees. Basal-area stocking of stands commonly ranges from 27.6 to 36.8 m²/ha (120 to 160 ft²/acre). A few older stands exceed 45.9 m²/ha (200 ft²/acre). Even-age and uneven-age silvicultural systems are available for managing stands in which sugar maple is a principal component and a desired species. Periodic annual growth averaging about 4.2 mi/ha (350 fbm/acre) and annual basal-area growth of up to 0.7 m²/ha (3 ft²/acre) is typical of young stands on good sites in the Lake States but varies with total basal-area stocking, distribution of trees by size class, and site (18). Improvement in grade and tree size should be the guiding principle in stand management because this factor contributes more to value increase than diameter growth under most conditions (41,75,105). Table-Yields from average, well-stocked stands of northern hardwoods in the Lake States dominated by sugar maple (adapted from 20) ¹Age determined from overstory trees. ²Cubic volumes determined from sound trees 13cm (5in) and larger in d.b.h. to a top diameter inside bark of 10cm (4in), exclusive of bark. ³The Scribner log rule was used for trees 23 cm (9in) and larger in d.b.h. to a variable top diameter, with a minimum of 20cm (8in) inside bark. Deductions were made for cull. Rooting Habit- The root system of sugar maple has strong, oblique laterals with extensive branching. Roots on the upper side of the laterals grow upward into the humus layers and those on the lower side grow downward. Most of the fine feeder roots remain within the general area of origin (23,103). Intraspecific root grafting is common. Although some root growth may continue throughout the year if the soil does not freeze, the bulk of the new root regeneration depends on growth factors exported from physiologically nondormant buds. In northern races of sugar maple, about 2,500 hours of continuous chilling are required to break bud dormancy (64). Sugar maple roots are extremely sensitive to flooding during the growing season. The roots of maple form both endotrophic and ectotrophic mycorrhizae. Reaction to Competition- Sugar maple is rated as very tolerant of shade, exceeded among hardwoods only by a few smaller, shorter lived species. In large trees, only American beech (Fagus grandifolia) equals it in tolerance under forest conditions (30). Maximum photosynthetic activity generally occurs under about 25 percent of full sunlight. The species can survive for long periods under heavy shade and still show a strong response to release (30). Release is seldom justifiable for young sugar maple stands subjected to suppression from scattered dominant trees or pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) because the sugar maple will overcome suppression under those conditions (30). Release is needed, however, when sugar maple competes with striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), black cherry (Prunus serotina), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and the oaks (Quercus spp.), because growth is retarded and survival is reduced by such competition (107). One sapling stand study showed that unreleased, dominant trees of good vigor averaged 23 mm (0.9 in) in diameter growth and heavily released trees averaged 46 mm (1.8 in) in diameter growth per year during a 7-year period; unreleased, codominant trees of good vigor averaged 18 mm (0.7 in) in diameter growth and heavily released trees 38 mm (1.5 in). Pole-size trees also respond well to release (31,102). If released too much, sugar maple readily develops epicormic sprouts from dormant buds (14,31,33, 36,78). Gradual release and good crown development provide adequate control over epicormic sprouting and also enhance natural pruning of epicormic branches on the lower bole. Consequently, proper thinning at scheduled intervals is necessary to encourage quality improvement as well as diameter growth. Damaging Agents- Early studies in old-growth sugar maple indicated that after two or possibly three cyclic cuts had been made, few damaging agents would affect trees or stands. Current work in second-growth, however, shows some major agents, particularly in even-aged stands (77,122). At least two species of bud miners, Proteoteras moffatiana and Obrussa ochrefasciella, overwinter in the terminal bud of sugar maple and kill it. This causes repeated forking, which reduces merchantable log length and adds to the risk of crown loss from splitting. Other bud-damaging insects that may also cause forks are Choristoneura rosaceana, Cenopis pettitana, Phyllobius oblongus, and Platycerus virescens (65,66,7798,123). Forking at the terminal bud occurs in trees of all ages but is especially pronounced in overstory trees. Side crowding and overhead shading help correct lower forking (32). But early or heavy thinning sets the fork and causes shorter merchantable lengths. As fork members increase in size and weight, fork breakage also increases. Except for bud losses, sugar maple is not highly susceptible to insect injury and serious outbreaks are not common (62). The most common insects to attack sugar maple are defoliators and these include the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), linden looper (Erannis tiliaria), fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), spring cankerworm (Paleacrita vernata), green-striped mapleworm (Anisota rubicunda), Bruce span-worm (Operophtera bruceata), maple leaf-cutter (Paraclemensia acerifoliella), maple trumpet skeletonizer (Epinotia aceriella), and saddled prominent (Heterocampa guttivitta). One insect of the genus Phytobia occasionally causes pith flecks that seriously degrade veneer logs. This insect tunnels the full length of the cambium layer and exits near the root collar (117). Borers that attack sugar maple include the carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), sugar maple borer (Glycobius speciosus), maple callus borer (Synanthedon acerni), and occasionally horntajls (Xiphydria abdominalis and X. maculata) (95). Sucking insects that affect sugar maple include the woolly alder aphid (Prociphilus tesselatus) and other aphid species (Neoprociphilus aceris and Periphyllus lyropictus) which injure leaves and reduce growth. Of the scale insects, the maple phenacoccus (Phenacoccus acericola), is the most important to sugar maple. The maple leaf scale (Pulvinaria acericola) and the gloomy scale (Melanaspis tenebricosa) also frequently attack sugar maple. Many sugar maple trees died in a small area of Wisconsin and Michigan in 1957 (113). Certain insects-the leaf rollers (Sparganothis acerivorana and Acleris chalybeana) and the maple webworm (Tetralopha asperatel1a)combined with disease and climatic factors were thought to be the cause of this mortality (44,48,61,120). The decline has abated but appears to have recurred with less severity on a portion of the same area in the late 1970's. Diseases of sugar maple generally deform, discolor, or decrease volume but seldom kill the tree (80). The two most important diseases in managed second-growth are probably Eutypella (Eutypella parasitica) and Nectria (Nectria galligena) cankers. In the Lake States these cankers each affect from about 1 to 4 percent of the trees (77) but in Ontario they occur more frequently (60,87). Nectria canker is more prevalent following shelterwood cuttings, probably because conditions favorable for infection are established (2). Two other cankers (Schizoxylon micro sporum and Hypoxylon lilakei) occur rarely on sugar maple. In a few instances cankers may kill a tree but generally only predispose it to breakage. Some common fungi-causing heart rots in sugar maple are Armillaria mellea, primarily a root-rotting fungus; Hydnum septentrionale, which causes a soft, spongy, white heart rot; Inonotus glomeratus, which causes white to light brown spongy heart rot; and Ustulina vulgaris, which causes a butt rot (30). The amount of defect in sugar maple trees in virgin and unmanaged stands is usually high-commonly from 35 to 50 percent (30). Defect resulting from logging damage usually is minor in small wounds for as long as 10 years, but 20-cm (8-in) scars all were infected within 20 years and value losses were significant (47,81). Logging injuries to the stems of residual trees and to reproduction frequently result in the entrance of decay and eventually serious volume loss (6,79). In a study in Upper Michigan at least 30 percent of the logging scars on the main stem of older trees resulted in serious defects within 15 to 20 years (30). Larger limbs broken in logging also usually result in serious defects (93,94). In Upper Michigan after a 20-year period about 8 percent cull resulted from decay and stain that had entered through scars on limbs 10 cm (4 in) and larger (30). Smaller limb breakage exposing only sapwood, however, generally results in little volume loss (4,30). Two wilts occasionally attack and kill sugar maple. Sapstreak, caused by Ceratocystis coerulenscens, enters through root injuries from logging and has been reported in several localities (56,57,80). Verticillium wilt, caused by Verticillium albo-atrum, is usually found only in shade trees. This wilt also invades the trees through the roots. When stored for more than a year, a saprophytic fungus, Cryptostroma corticale, sometimes develops on the bark of sugar maple. The spores from this fungus are released during processing and have caused bronchial asthma and severe allergenic lung disorders to millworkers (83,84). Physical and climatic injuries often occur on sugar maple. Much damage from glaze storms occurred in New York in 1942. The injured trees showed a slight tendency to sprout and renew growth. Many of the smaller trees that had 85 percent or more of their crown broken away developed saprot (30). Winter sunscald frequently occurs in even-aged sugar maple stands. Trees are damaged from late winter heating of the bole above the snowline on bright sunny days followed by rapid freezing that ruptures the cells. Most injury occurs when the stems are 2.5 to 7.6 cm (1 to 3 in) in d.b.h., and certain topographic positions are affected more than others (55). Healing in dense stands is slow, if at all, and later stages often appear to be a simple frost crack. Various fungi may be present but may or may not prevent closure (59). Part of the lack of closure may be due to shrinkage and swelling of the bole associated with changes in air temperature (35). In some areas the lower portion of sugar maple boles contains many vertical cracks from 2.5 to 7.6 cm (1 to 3 in) long. Although these cracks have been termed annual maple cankers, the causal agent does not seem to be a fungus. These cankers slowly disappear and new ones recur at short intervals (32). In Pennsylvania they were most common on slowly permeable soils (116) but no specific cause has been identified (3,58). Sugar maple can be severely damaged from deicing road salt (96). In an industrial area the number of overstory sugar maples was markedly reduced from exposure to sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, chlorides, and fluorides. Sugar maple remained an abundant species in the understory because of a lower exposure level (72). Numerous animals feed on or injure sugar maple without serious effect except in local and limited situations. Deer browsing is probably the most common wildlife factor. Winter browsing in the Lake States causes little damage or reduced growth (51,100). In the central Adirondacks, however, continual browsing of sugar maple allows American beech, which the deer avoid, to dominate northern hardwood understories (54). Red, grey, and flying squirrels sometimes gnaw or feed on the seed, buds, foliage, and twigs of sugar maple. In rare instances, they have girdled and killed larger branches and tree tops (30,100). Porcupines may feed on the bark and kill the top by girdling the upper stem (8,30). Sapsuckers frequently peck and cause degrade in some sugar maple trees but rarely, if ever, kill the tree (19,82,90,92). On heavily pecked trees in the spring a fungus develops on the sap and causes the bark to turn black (82). Such trees probably should be retained in the stand to prevent other trees from being attacked.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sugar Maple,acer,saccharum,hardwood,14,0
"The sugar maple tree is the principal source of maple sugar. The trees are tapped early in the spring for the first flow of sap, which usually has the highest sugar content. The sap is collected and boiled or evaporated to a syrup. Further concentration by evaporation produces the maple sugar. Sugar maple sap averages about 2.5 percent sugar; about 129 liters (34 gal) of sap are required to make 3.8 liters (1 gal) of syrup or 3.6 kg (8 lb) of sugar. Guides have been printed for developing a sugar bush from natural stands (67). Breeding experiments have determined that sugar content is high for certain families and that sugar content in individual trees is consistent over a period of years (64,104). A sugar content of 7.4 percent has been attained by crossing two selected parents of slightly lower content (64). The sugar content is also correlated with the volume yield of sap (7,74).",Special Uses,Sugar Maple,acer,saccharum,hardwood,16,0
"Sugar pine is a major timber species at middle elevations in the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains, Cascade, Sierra Nevada, Transverse, and Peninsula Ranges. Rarely forming pure stands, it grows singly or in small groups of trees. It is the main component in the forest cover type Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Society of American Foresters Type 243) (10) generally comprising 5 to 25 percent of the stocking. It is a minor component in 10 other types: 207 Red Fir 211 White Fir 229 Pacific Douglas-Fir 231 Port-Orford-Cedar 232 Redwood 234 Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone 244 Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir 246 California Black Oak 247 Jeffrey Pine 249 Canyon Live Oak In the northern part of its range, sugar pine is commonly associated with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), grand fir (Abies grandis), incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), and Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii). In the central part it is associated with ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine (Pin us jeffreyi), white fir (Abies concolor), incense-cedar, California red fir (A. magnifica), giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii). Farther south, the usual associates are Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), incense-cedar, white fir, and bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa). At upper elevations Jeffrey pine, western white pine (Pinus monticola), California red fir, and lodgepole pine (P. contorta) grow with sugar pine. In the Sierra San Pedro Martir, Jeffrey pine and white fir are the main associates. Common brush species beneath sugar pine include greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), deerbrush (Ceanothus integerrimus), snowbrush (C. velutinus), mountain whitethorn (C. cordulatus), squawcarpet (C. prostratus), bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), bush chinkapin (Castanopsis sempervirens), bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata), salal (Gaultheria shallon), coast rhododendron (Rhododendron californicum), and gooseberries and currants in the genus Ribes (11). From a silvicultural standpoint, Ribes spp. are especially important because they are alternate hosts to the white pine blister rust fungus (Cronartium ribicola). At least 19 different species grow in the Mixed Conifer Type, of which the Sierra gooseberry (Ribes roezlii) is most prevalent on more xeric, upland sites, and the Sierra currant (R. nevadense) on more mesic sites (35).",Associated Forest Cover,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,1,1
"Temperature and precipitation vary widely throughout the range of sugar pine. For equivalent latitudes, temperature decreases and precipitation increases with elevation, and for equivalent elevations, temperature increases and precipitation decreases from north to south. Patterns unifying this variability are relatively warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Precipitation during July and August is usually less than 25 mm (1 in) per month, and summertime relative humidities are low. Although water stored in snowpacks and soils delays the onset and shortens the duration of summer drought, evaporative stress often becomes great enough to arrest growth in the middle of the season (15). Most precipitation occurs between November and April, as much as two-thirds of it in the form of snow at middle and upper elevations (26). Within its natural range, precipitation varies from about 840 to 1750 mm (33 to 69 in). Because winter temperatures are relatively mild and seldom below freezing during the day, considerable photosynthesis and assimilation are possible during the dormant season, at least partially offsetting the effects of summer drought (15).",Climate,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,2,1
"Sugar pine is one of the more genetically variable members of the genus. Average heterozygosity of specific genes coding for seed proteins (isozymes) was 26 percent, a value near the upper range (0 to 36 percent) of pines studied so far (6). How adaptive variation is distributed over the range of environments encountered in over 14° of latitude and 2000 m (6,560 ft) of elevation is largely unknown, however, because of a lack of field data from provenance or progeny tests. In a 3-year nursery trial, pronounced differences in height and diameter growth were found among seedlings of five seed sources sampled along an elevational transect on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada (18). The fastest growing seedlings were from the lower-middle elevation (1100 m or 3,595 ft) and were twice the height of those from the highest elevation (2195 m or 7,200 ft). Except for the source from the lowest elevation (770 m or 2,525 ft), which ranked second, growth varied inversely with elevation. Elevation of the seed source accounted for 52 percent of the total variance among seedlings, and the component of variance for families within stands was a substantial 16 percent. More comprehensive nursery trials, of families from seed parents ranging from southern California to southern Oregon, showed similar trends (27). Greatest growth was expressed in seedlings from intermediate elevations in the central Sierra Nevada, a result consistent with observations in natural stands. Thus, genetic adaptation to climatic variables associated with elevation is clearly evident in sugar pine, requiring a close match between seed source and planting site in artificial regeneration. The degree of variability expressed among progenies of different seed parents within seed collection zones indicates that selection for rapid early growth should be effective. Resistance to white pine blister rust is strongly inherited, and three different kinds have been recognized (29). A rapid, hypersensitive reaction to invading mycelium is conditioned by a dominant gene. This gene, which occurs at variable but relatively low frequencies throughout the range of sugar pine, is highly effective against most sources of inoculum. A race of blister rust capable of overcoming this gene was discovered in a plantation in the Klamath Mountains (30), but evidently had not spread from this site 10 years after it was found (31). In certain families, another kind of resistance is expressed by slower rates of infection and mortality, fewer infections per tree, and by a higher rate of abortion of incipient infections. This ""slow rusting"" is apparently inherited quantitatively and, while less dramatic than single gene resistance, may be more stable to variation in the pathogen in the long term. Probably two or more generations of selection and breeding will be necessary to accumulate enough genes in parental stock to make this kind of resistance usable in commercial silviculture. A third kind of resistance is age-dependent. In common garden tests, infection among grafted clones from mature trees ranged from 0 to 100 percent, yet offspring from the apparently resistant clones were fully susceptible. Although not understood, the mechanisms and inheritance of mature tree resistance are very strong and could play a significant role in stabilizing resistance over a rotation. Since all three kinds of resistance are inherited independently, there is a real promise for an enduring and well-buffered genetic control of this most destructive disease.",Genetics,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,7,1
"Barriers to crossing with other white pines are very strong in sugar pine (7). No natural hybrids are known and repeated attempts to cross sugar pine with other North American white pines have failed. Small numbers of F1 hybrids were made with two Asiatic white pines, however: Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) and Armand pine (P. armandii). These species are of silvicultural interest because of their relative resistance to blister rust. Mass production of F1 seed is probably impractical because of low seed set, but backcrosses of P. lambertiana x armandii to sugar pine have yielded abundant sound seed. In limited field tests, the backcross progenies were more resistant than intraspecific crosses of the same sugar pine parents. By using a broader genetic base of P. armandii, resistance in the backcross could be improved.",Hybrids,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,9,1
"Sugar pine extends from the west slope of the Cascade Range in north central Oregon to the Sierra San Pedro Martir in Baja California (approximate latitude 30° 30' to 45° 10' N.). Its distribution is almost continuous through the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains and on west slopes of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada, but smaller and more disjunct populations are found in the Coast Ranges of southern Oregon and California, Transverse and Peninsula Ranges of southern California, and east of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada crests. Its southern extremity is an isolated population high on a plateau in the Sierra San Pedro Martir in Baja California. Over 80 percent of the growing stock is in California (49) where the most extensive and dense populations are found in mixed conifer forests on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada. In elevation, sugar pine ranges from near sea level in the Coast Ranges to more than 3000 m (10,000 ft) in the Transverse Range.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Sugar pine is monoecious. Reproductive buds are set in July and August but are not discernible until late in the next spring. Time of pollination ranges from late May to early August, depending on elevation, and to a lesser extent on latitude. Female strobili are 2.5 to 5.0 cm (1 to 2 in) long at time of pollination and double in size by the end of the growing season. Fertilization of eggs by male gametes takes place late the following spring, about 12 months after pollination. By this time, the seed is at its final size with a fully developed coat. Conelet elongation continues during the second season until maturation in late summer. Mature sugar pine cones are among the largest of all conifers, averaging 30 cm (12 in) and ranging up to 56 cm (22 in) long. Dates of cone opening range from mid-August at low elevations to early October at high elevations (12,19,32). Cone production starts later and is less prolific in sugar pine than in its associates. During a 16-year study in the central Sierra, fewer than 5 percent of sugar pines less than 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h., and 50 percent less than 31 cm (12 in) in d.b.h., produced cones. Of trees 51 cm (20 in) or more, 80 percent produced cones, and dominant trees produced 98 percent of the total. Intervals between heavy cone crops averaged 4 years and ranged from 2 to 7 (12). Loss of sugar pine cones is heavy; the probability of a pollinated conelet developing to maturity is only 40 to 50 percent. Predation by the sugar pine cone beetle (Conophthorus lambertianae) can cause up to 93 percent loss. Douglas squirrels and white-headed woodpeckers also take a heavy toll (7,11,17). Spontaneous abortion of first-year conelets is high. Observations of control-pollinated trees in the Klamath Mountains showed that 19 percent of female strobili were lost 5 to 12 weeks after bagging, with no obvious signs of insect or pathogen-caused damage (41). The amount of abortion varied from 15 to 85 percent among trees, for both bagged and unbagged strobili. Since this pattern was consistent in successive years, a genetic cause was suggested. Seed Production and Dissemination- Mature trees produce large amounts of sound seeds. In a study of 210 trees in 13 stands in the central and northern Sierra Nevada, the average number of sound seeds per cone was 150, with individual trees ranging from 34 to 257. Higher numbers of seeds per cone (209 to 219) have been reported, but whether the count was based on sound or total seeds was not specified. In good crop years, the proportion of sound seeds is usually high (67 to 99 percent) but in light crop years can fall as low as 28 percent (7,12). Cones are ripe and start to open when their color turns light brown and specific gravity (fresh weight basis) drops to about 0.62. Seed shed may begin in late August at low elevations and at higher elevations is usually complete by the end of October (11). Seeds are large and heavy, averaging 4,630 seeds per kilogram (2,100/lb). Since their wings are relatively small for their size, seeds are not often dispersed great distances by wind, and 80 percent fall within 30 m (100 ft) of the parent tree. Birds and small mammals may be an important secondary mechanism of dispersal, even though they consume most of the seeds they cache. In good seed years, large amounts of seed fall, with estimates ranging from 86,500 to more than 444,800/ha (35,000 to 180,000/acre) in central Sierra Nevada stands (11,32). Seedling Development- Sugar pine seeds show dormancy, which can be readily broken by stratification for 60 to 90 days or by removal of the seed coat and inner papery membrane surrounding the seed. Germination of fresh seed is uniformly rapid and high, exceeding 90 percent if adequately ripened, cleaned, and stratified. Viability may decline rapidly with time in storage at temperatures above freezing, but deep-frozen seed maintains viability much longer (1,32,47). On unprepared seed beds, seed-to-seedling ratios are high (244 to 483). Soil scarification reduced the ratio to 70 in one case, and scarification with rodent poisoning dropped it to 38 in another (12). Seedling losses are continual and only 20 to 25 percent of the initial germinants may survive as long as 10 years. Drought may kill up to half of the first-year seedlings. Cutworms and rodents, which eat seeds still attached to seedling cotyledons, also take their toll (11,12). Seedlings infected by blister rust rarely survive more than a few years. Germination is epigeal (32). Seedlings rapidly grow a deep taproot when seeds germinate on bare mineral soil. In one comparison, taproots penetrated to an average depth of 43 cm (17 in) on a bare sandy soil, but only half as deep when the soil was overlain with duff (11). Lateral roots develop near and parallel to the soil surface, often growing downward some distance from the stem. In heavier, more shallow soils, laterals are often larger than taproots. During the second season, laterals commonly originate on the lower taproot and occupy a cone of soil which has its base at the tip of the taproot. After 2 years on three different soil types in Oregon, the taproots of natural sugar pine seedlings ranged from 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 in), were significantly deeper than those of Douglas-fir and grand fir, but shorter than those of ponderosa pine and incense-cedar. Lengths of main lateral roots showed the same species differences. Top-to-root ratios for sugar pine ranged from 0.17 to 0.28 (length) and from 1.33 to 1.60 (dry weight) (46). Seasonal shoot growth starts later and terminates earlier in sugar pine than in its usual conifer associates, except white fir. At middle elevations in the central Sierra Nevada, shoot elongation begins in late May, about 2 weeks after ponderosa pine and a month before white fir, and lasts about 7 weeks. Radial growth begins about 6 weeks earlier than shoot growth and extends throughout the summer (11). Planting of sugar pine has not been so easy or successful as for some of the yellow pines. Although reasons for the many recorded failures are often complex, lower drought tolerance may be one of the factors. During natural regeneration, the ability of sugar pine seedlings to avoid summer drought by rapidly growing a deep taproot largely compensates for the relative intolerance of tissues to moisture stress (38). To survive the first summer after planting, seedlings must have the capacity to regenerate vigorous new root systems. For other western conifers, root growth capacity is conditioned by particular combinations of nursery environment and time in cold storage after lifting; these requirements are species and seed-source specific (22,24,38). Although patterns of root growth capacity have not been worked out for sugar pine, it is clear that amounts of root growth are substantially less for sugar pine than for its associates (23). Early top growth of sugar pine is not so rapid as that of western yellow pines, and 1-year stock is too small for planting when seed is sown in May, for years the tradition in California nurseries. Root diseases, to which young sugar pines are unusually vulnerable, can compound the problem by weakening seedlings that survive, thus reducing their chances of establishment on the site. Sowing stratified seed in February or March extended the growing season and produced healthy seedlings of plantable size in one season (23). A more expensive alternative to bareroot stock that holds some promise is containerized seedlings grown under accelerated growth regimes (28). Vegetative Reproduction- Sugar pine does not sprout, but young trees can be rooted from cuttings. The degree of success is apparently under strong genetic control. In one trial the proportion of cuttings that rooted from different ortets from 3 to 6 years old ranged from 0 to 100 percent (27). As for most conifers, rootability diminishes rapidly with age of donor tree. Grafts, however, can be made from donors of all ages, with success rates from 70 to 80 percent common. Problems of incompatibility, frequent in some species such as Douglas-fir, are rare in sugar pine.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Veteran sugar pines often reach great size. Large trees have commonly scaled 114 to 142 m³ (20,000 to 25,000 fbm, Scribner log rule), with a record of 232 m³ (40,710 fbm). A ""champion,"" located on the North Fork of the Stanislaus River in California, measured 65.8 m (216 ft) tall and 310 cm (122 in) in d.b.h., but trees up to 76 m (250 ft) tall have been reported (11,36). These and previous champions of this century are dwarfed by the first sugar pine measured by David Douglas and described in his diary (37): ""Three feet from the ground, 57 feet 9 inches in circumference; 134 feet from the ground, 17 feet 5 inches; extreme length 215 feet."" Early growth of sugar pine is slow compared with ponderosa pine, but growth rates accelerate in the pole stage and are sustained for longer periods than those of common associates. Consequently, sugar pines are usually the largest trees, except for giant sequoia, in mature and old-growth stands. On better sites annual growth increments in basal area of 2.5 percent and more can be sustained up to stem diameters of 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in) or for 100 to 150 years (11). Growth of sugar pine is best between 1370 and 1830 m (4,500 and 6,000 ft) in the central Sierra Nevada, between the American and San Joaquin Rivers. In young mixed conifer stands, sugar pine often constitutes a relatively small proportion of the total basal area but contributes disproportionately to growth increment. On the El Dorado National Forest in the western Sierra Nevada, in stands ranging in age from 50 to 247 years, the sugar pine component was only 6 to 7 percent (range: 3 to 14 percent) of the average basal area, but its average annual basal area growth was 11.3 percent (range: 2 to 35 percent) of the stand total. A similar relationship was found on the Plumas National Forest in the northern Sierra Nevada: in stands from 58 to 95 years old, average basal area of sugar pine was 7 percent (3 to 16), but 10-year growth was more than 12 percent (6 to 19). Ten-year volume increment in mixed conifer stands from 40 to 80 years old was greater for sugar pine than for Douglas-fir, white fir, ponderosa pine, and incense-cedar in each of five basal area categories (9). Mean increment for sugar pine was 4.1 percent, compared to 3.1 percent for all others. Yields of sugar pine are difficult to predict, because it grows in mixes of varying proportion with other species. In the old-growth forest, the board foot volume of sugar pine was 40 percent of total in stands dominated by ponderosa pine and sugar pine. In exceptional cases on very small areas, yields were 2688 m³/ha (192,000 fbm/acre) (11). Yield tables for young growth are based on averages for all commercial conifers and assume full stocking (8). The data base is limited, so the tables are at best a rough guide. Realistically, yields may reach 644 m³/ha (46,000 fbm/acre) in 120 years on medium sites, and Up to 1190 m³/ha (85,000 fbm/acre) in 100 years on the best sites, with intensive management (11). Rooting Habit- Sugar pine develops a deep taproot at an early age. Reaction to Competition- Sugar pine tolerates shade better than ponderosa pine but is slightly less tolerant than incense-cedar and Douglas-fir and much less so than white fir (14). A seral species, it becomes less tolerant with age, and overtopped trees decline unless released (11). Thus, dominant sugar pines in old-growth stands were probably dominant from the start, or released by natural causes early in life. White fir would usually be the climax species in mixed conifer forests in the absence of any natural disturbance; however, fire, insects, disease, and other agents are natural and pervasive features of these forests. Such disturbances frequently cause gaps, in which the relatively tolerant sugar pine is adapted to grow (14). For these reasons, sugar pine is often adapted to regenerate in a shelterwood silvicultural system (33). Competition from brush severely retards seedling establishment and growth. Only 18 percent of seedlings starting under brush survived over a period of 18 to 24 years, and after 10 years the tallest seedlings measured were only 29 cm (11.4 in). Given an even start with brush, however, seedlings can compete successfully (11). Light shelterwoods can protect seedlings of sugar pine and white fir against frost, which seldom affects ponderosa and Jeffrey pines, and provide them with a competitive advantage because of their greater tolerance to shade (13,43,44). On the other hand, young sugar pines stagnate beneath an overstory and in competition with root systems of established trees or brush. But because they respond well to release, the basal area increment of sugar pines is often double that of companion species after heavy thinnings (33). Thus, skill in the amount and timing of overstory removal is a key factor in successful silvicultural management of sugar pine. Sugar pine does not self-prune early, even in dense stands, and mechanical pruning is necessary to ensure clear lumber of high quality. Damaging Agents- The pathology of sugar pine is dominated by white pine blister rust, caused by Cronartium ribicola, a disease serious enough to severely limit natural regeneration in areas of high hazard, and thereby alter successional trends. Among commercially important North American white pines, sugar pine is the most susceptible. Infected seedlings and young trees are inevitably killed by cankers girdling the main stem. Blister rust was introduced into western North America shortly after the turn of the century at a single point on Vancouver Island and has since spread eastward throughout the Inland Empire and south through the Cascade, Klamath, North Coast, and Sierra Nevada Ranges. It has not yet been found in the Transverse or Peninsular Ranges of southern California, even though alternate host species are abundant there. Within the range of sugar pine, conditions for infection are not nearly so uniform as for western white pine in the Inland Empire. Incidence and intensity of infection on sugar pine are highest in Oregon and northern California and become progressively less to the south, as climate becomes warmer and drier. Within any area, however, hazard varies widely and depends on local site conditions. These are complex, but two of the most important factors are the duration of moisture retention on foliage following rain, fog, or dew, and the distribution and density of the alternate hosts, currant and gooseberry bushes (Ribes spp.). Thus, cool north slopes are more hazardous than warm south slopes, and relatively humid stream bottoms and lakesides are more hazardous than upland sites. In the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada of northern California, infection averaged two to three times higher near stream bottoms than on adjacent slopes (4). Attempts to control blister rust by chemical therapy or eradicating alternate hosts have been abandoned as impractical and ineffective. Except on highly hazardous sites, sugar pine in natural stands can be effectively managed by judiciously selecting leave trees with cankers relatively far from the bole and by pruning cankers in the lower crown (4). Plantations are a much more serious problem. The microenvironmental changes on a site following clearcutting-including dew formation on foliage and the rapid regeneration of alternate host Ribes spp.greatly augment the probability of rust intensification and spread on both hosts. Uniform age and stocking make sugar pine plantations vulnerable to nearly total destruction for 20 years or longer. Genetically resistant sugar pines in mixture with other conifers offer the most promising solution. Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium californicum) may seriously damage infected trees by reducing growth in height, diameter, and crown size, and predisposing weakened trees to attack by bark beetles. Extending throughout the range of sugar pine, except for isolated stands in Nevada, the south Coast Ranges of California, and Baja California, this mistletoe was found in only 22 percent of the stands examined and on only 10 percent of the trees in those stands. Spread is slow and can be controlled by sanitation cutting (20,42). A needle cast caused by Lophodermella arcuata is occasionally and locally damaging. Root diseases caused by Armillaria mellea, Heterobasidion annosum, and Verticicladiella wageneri are capable of killing trees of all ages and sizes but, though widespread, are usually at endemic levels. Several trunk and butt rots attack sugar pine but are usually confined to mature and overmature trees (2,21). Several root and damping-off pathogens cause severe damage to sugar pine in nurseries, with annual losses up to 50 percent (45). In approximate order of importance, these are Fusarium oxysporum, Macrophomina phaseoli, and species of Pythium, Phytophthora, and Rhizoctonia. In addition to causing direct losses in the nursery, these diseases may reduce field survival of planted seedlings in more stressful environments by causing stunting and chlorosis. Nursery fumigation controls most of the organisms involved but is least effective on Fusarium. A simple and promising alternative control method is early sowing of stratified seed. Soil temperatures in late winter and early spring permit seed germination and root development but are still cool enough to inhibit fungal growth. Sugar pine hosts many different insects, but the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is of overwhelming importance. This insect can cause widespread mortality, often killing large groups of trees (48). Several other bark-feeding insects contribute directly or indirectly to mortality in sugar pines, particularly after periods of drought. Death results from predisposing trees to mountain pine beetle. The red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) is usually restricted to small areas near the root crown but during drought may extend two or more meters up the bole, destroying the entire cambium. The California flatheaded borer (Melanophila californica) usually attacks decadent and unhealthy trees, but trees under heavy moisture stress are also vulnerable. The California fivespined ips (Ips paraconfusus) is only capable of penetrating thin bark in sugar pine. Small trees are often killed, but large trees only top-killed (16). The sugar pine cone beetle (Conophthorus lambertianae) can be extremely destructive to developing second-year cones, destroying up to 75 percent of the crop in some years. Since stunted cones are apparent by mid-June, the extent of the crop loss can be assessed well before cone collection. The sugar pine scale (Matsucoccus paucicicatrices) occasionally kills foliage and branches, predisposing trees to bark beetle attack. The dead ""flags"" resulting from heavy attack mimic advanced symptoms of white pine blister rust. Occasionally, the black pineleaf scale (Nuculaspis californica) defoliates sugar pine at midcrown, weakening the tree. These scale attacks are often associated with industrial air pollution or heavy dust deposits on foliage (16). Among its coniferous associates, sugar pine is the most tolerant to oxidant air pollution (34), while intermediate in fire tolerance (39) and frost tolerance (43,44). It is less tolerant of drought than most companion species with which it has been critically compared, including knobcone (Pinus attenuata) and Coulter pines (50,51), ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, incense-cedar, and grand fir (40).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,14,1
"Sugar pine grows naturally over a wide range of soil conditions typically associated with conifer-hardwood forests. Soil parent materials include rocks of volcanic, granitic, and sedimentary origin and their metamorphic equivalents and are usually not of critical importance. Soils formed on ultrabasic intrusive igneous rocks such as peridotite and serpentinite, however, have low calcium-to-magnesium ratios and usually support open conifer stands of inferior growth and quality. Nevertheless, sugar pine is often the dominant conifer on the more mesic of these sites (39,40). Because site productivity is a function of several environmental variables-edaphic, climatic, and biotic-it is difficult to relate parent material groups or particular soil series with specific productivity classes, especially when they span wide ranges of elevation and latitude. Other factors being equal, the main edaphic influences on conifer growth are soil depth and texture, permeability, chemical characteristics, and drainage and runoff properties (5). The most extensive soils supporting sugar pine are well drained, moderately to rapidly permeable, and acid in reaction. Soils derived from ultrabasic rocks are very slightly acid to neutral (pH 7.0). In general, acidity increases with soil depth. Several edaphic properties are influenced by the degree of soil profile development. Soil porosity, permeability, and infiltration rate decrease with more developed profiles, while water-holding capacity, rate of run-off, and vulnerability to compaction increase. Sugar pine reaches its best development and highest density on mesic soils of medium textures (sandy loam to clay loams) but ranges into the lower reaches of frigid soils when other climatic variables are suitable. These soils are found most commonly in the order Ultisols and Alfisols. The best stands in the Sierra Nevada grow on deep, sandy loam soils developed from granitic rock. In the southern Cascade Range the best stands are on deep clay loams developed on basalt and rhyolite. In the Coast Range and Siskiyou Mountains in California and Oregon, the best stands are on soils derived from sandstone and shale. Much of the terrain occupied by sugar pine is steep and rugged. Sugar pines are equally distributed on all aspects at lower elevations but grow best on warm exposures (southern and western) as elevation increases. Optimal growth occurs on gentle terrain at middle elevations.",Soils and Topography,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,15,1
"Upper grades of old-growth sugar pine command premium prices for specialty uses where high dimensional stability, workability, and affinity for glue are essential. The wood is light (specific gravity, 0.34 ± 0.03) (3), resists shrinkage, warp, and twist, and is preferred for finely carved pattern stock for machinery and foundry casting. Uniformly soft, thin-celled spring and summer wood and straight grain account for the ease with which it cuts parallel to or across the grain, and for its satin-textured, lustrous finish when milled. Its easy working qualities favor it for molding, window and door frames, window sashes, doors, and other special products such as piano keys and organ pipes. Wood properties of young growth are not so well known. Pruning would undoubtedly be required to produce clear lumber during short rotations.",Special Uses,Sugar Pine,pinus,lambertiana,conifer,16,1
"Sugarberry seems to present a considerable number of local variations that have prompted some botanists to name a number of varieties, while other botanists feel the distinctions are too slight to warrant such status (13).

"Sugarberry ranges south from southeastern Virginia to southern Florida, west to central Texas and northeastern Mexico, and north to western Oklahoma, southern Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and western Kentucky. It is local in Maryland, the Rio Grande Valley, and northeastern Mexico. Its range overlaps the southern part of the range of hackberry (C. occidentalis). -The native range of sugarberry. Sugarberry grows in a humid climate except for part of its range in Oklahoma and Texas which lies west of a north-south line through Galveston Bay. There the climate is semihumid to semiarid. The average precipitation varies from 510 to 1520 mm (20 to 60 in) per year, the lightest being in central Texas and Oklahoma. An average of 380 to 760 mm (15 to 30 in) occurs during the frost-free period. Annual snowfall ranges from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in). Summer temperatures vary from an average of 27° C (80° F) to extremes of 46° C (115° F). Average winter temperatures are from -1° to 10° C (30° to 50° F), with an extreme of -29° C (-20° F). The average length of the growing season varies from 150 to 270 days. Sugarberry is most common on Inceptisols and Entisols found in broad flats or shallow sloughs within flood plains of major southern rivers (9), but will grow under a considerable range of soil and moisture conditions. It is widely distributed on bottom lands except in deep swamps and is found to a minor extent on upland sites. It is also common on deep moist soils derived from limestones, notably in the Black Belt of Alabama (10). Sugarberry appears with the following forest cover types (11): Cottonwood (Society of American Foresters Type 63), Sweetgurn-Willow Oak (Type 92), Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93), Sycamore-Sweetgurn-American Elm (Type 94), Black Willow (Type 95), and Overcup Oak-Water Hickory (Type 96). Other tree associates are cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), winged elm (U. alata), water oak Quercus nigra), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos), red maple (Acer rubrum), and boxelder (A. negundo). Some important noncommercial tree and shrub associates are swamp-privet (Forestiera acuminata), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.).",Habitat,Sugarberry,celtis,laevigata,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The small, greenish flowers appear with the leaves in the early spring-from mid-March to May, depending on latitude (1). Sugarberry is polygamo-monoecious. The fruit ripens in September and October, and often remains on the trees until midwinter. Sugarberry fruits are spherical drupes 6 to 13 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in) in diameter with a thin pulp enclosing a single bony nutlet. Late spring frosts sometimes kill the flowers and reduce the seed crop. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production starts when trees are about 15 years old (7). Optimum seed-bearing age is from 30 to 70 years old. Sugarberry bears good seed crops in most years and some nearly every year. There are between 4,400 and 5,300 cleaned seeds per kilogram (2,000 to 2,400/lb). The seed is widely dispersed by birds and water. Mature fruits can be picked by hand from trees as late as midwinter. Collection is easier after trees have completely dropped their leaves. Branches of sugarberry can be flailed to knock the fruits onto sheets of plastic or other suitable material spread under the trees. If seeds are to be used for seedling production in a nursery, then both fall sowing of untreated seeds and spring sowing of stratified seeds are satisfactory. Seeds may be broadcast or drilled in rows and should be covered with 6 to 13 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in) of firmed soil. Beds should be covered with bird screens until germination starts. Experience at the Southern Hardwoods Laboratory, Stoneville, MS, has shown that if spring sowing is used, the seeds should be depulped before storage, dried to 8 to 10 percent moisture content, and stored in 6-mil-thick plastic bags or equivalent storage containers until stratification. Seeds should be stratified in moist sand or other suitable media for 60 to 90 days before sowing in the nursery. The seeds can be depulped by wet maceration. Depulping is not essential, but it has been reported to aid germination (1). Average germinative capacity is reported to be 55 percent for sugarberry. Seedling Development- Sugarberry seeds lie dormant over winter and germinate early in the spring. Germination is epigeal (1). The seedlings become established under most stands of southern bottom land hardwoods. Best natural conditions for germination are moist, loamy soil, but the species is found mostly on clay soils. First-year growth usually produces a very slender but tough stem, 20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 in) in height. Under shade, the young seedling develops a crooked, short stem, often forked within a few feet of the ground. In the open, it tends to be very limby and short boled. Sugarberry is considered intolerant of flooding, at least in the seedling stage (2,3,4). Vegetative Reproduction- Sugarberry can be propagated by cuttings (7). Small stumps sprout readily, and there is some sprouting from root collars of fire-damaged seedlings and saplings. Growth and Yield- Sugarberry is a small- to medium-sized tree. It often attains a height of 24 to 30 in (80 to 100 ft) at maturity. On best sites, 10-year diameter growth can be in excess of 6 cm (2.5 in) for dominant trees (9). The overall average is about 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in 10 years. On average sites, mature forest-grown trees average about 46 cm (18 in) in diameter and 24 in (80 ft) in height, with trunks clear of branches for approximately 9 m (30 ft). An accurate estimate of the total growing stock is available for only a limited portion of the sugarberry range. Because of its scattered occurrence, forest surveys usually include sugarberry in a group of other species with limited frequencies. The only region containing enough sugarberry of sawtimber size to list separately is the Mississippi Delta (10). The principal States producing commercial quantities of sugarberry are Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas. These States contain about 16 million m³ (560 million ft³) and about 9.4 million m³ (1,650 million fbm) of sugarberry sawtimber. In 1965, a rough estimate of the total sawtimber resource in the United States was in excess of 10.0 million m' (2,000 million fbm). Rooting Habit- Sugarberry is a relatively shallow-rooted tree and does not develop a distinct taproot. The root system is saucer-shaped with good lateral root development. The tree is about average in resistance to windthrow. Reaction to Competition- Sugarberry is classed as tolerant of shade. It grows fast when released and often outgrows more desirable forest species (5). Sugarberry becomes established in the understory and generally has very poor form in this situation. In dense, even-aged stands, however, it prunes itself well and produces a straight stem. Damaging Agents- The bark is thin and easily injured by fire. A light burn kills back reproduction. Heavier bums may kill even the largest trees and wound others, making them subject to serious butt rot, which in sugarberry advances rapidly. Butt rot is a common name used to indicate the area of the decay in the butt log which may be caused by any one of 30 or more species of fungi belonging to the genera Fomes, Polyporus, Hericium, and Plyeurotus. Ice also causes heavy damage to the crowns, breaking the main stem and branches which reduces growth and creates wounds that allow entrance of rot-causing fungi. There are some other diseases of the twigs and leaves, but none are of major importance. Eastern mistletoe (Phoraedendron flavescens) may cause serious damage in the western part of its range (7). A number of scales attack the twigs, small branches, and sometimes the trunks, but none are considered very damaging. Leaf petiole galls caused by the hackberry petiole gall maker (Pachypsylla venusta) are common. In recent years, defoliation of large acreages in several Southern States by larvae of the hackberry butterfly (Asterocampa celtis) have been reported (12). No deaths or crown die-back among the trees was observed in the following years. Research has shown that the hackberry butterfly can be controlled by spraying trees with certain registered insecticides (8).",Life History,Sugarberry,celtis,laevigata,hardwood,10,0
"Sugarberry mixed with hackberry supplies the lumber known as hackberry. Small amounts are used for dimension stock, veneer, and containers, but the main use of sugarberry wood is for furniture. The light-colored wood can be given a light- to medium-brown finish that in other woods must be achieved by bleaching. The dry sweet fruit is eaten by at least 10 species of birds, as well as other game and nongame animals (13). Sugarberry is often used for street planting in the lower South and is also used as an ornamental in residential areas. A problem in such use is that leachates from the leaves reduce germination and growth of a number of grasses under the trees (6). These leachates have been identified in the soil as ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid.",Special Uses,Sugarberry,celtis,laevigata,hardwood,16,0
"Swamp cottonwood is sparse throughout its range and is not a major species in any forest cover type. It is most often found in the following types (2): Baldcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 101), Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102), and Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Type 103).

"Swamp cottonwood inhabits the wet bottom lands and sloughs of the Coastal Plain from Connecticut and southeastern New York to Georgia and northwestern Florida, west to Louisiana. It grows north in the Mississippi Valley to southeastern Missouri, western Tennessee, Kentucky, southern Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and southern Michigan (5). -The native range of swamp cottonwood.",Native Range,Swamp Cottonwood,populus,heterophylla,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Swamp cottonwood is dioecious. Flowers are proteranthous, appearing from March to May. Staminate catkins are rather stiffly pendant, oblong, cylindric, and 5 to 10 cm 2 to 4 in) long; pistillate catkins are 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in) long, pendulous, slender, and raceme-like. Pollination is by wind. Fruits ripen and the seeds fall from April through July. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees start seed production at about 10 years. Reddish-brown obovoid seeds number about 330,700/kg (150,000/lb) (9). Seeds are very small, light in weight, and tufted with hairs, features that allow them to be blown over 100 in (330 ft) by wind and to float for a considerable distance in water. Water is an important transporting agent since the bottom lands normally flood during the seedfall period. Numerous seeds are produced annually, but under natural. field conditions they remain viable for no more than a week or two. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Best seedling establishment is from seeds that quickly settle on unshaded, moist mineral soil in shallow swamps, deep sloughs, and along often-flooded creeks or rivers. Seedlings require nearly full sunlight to survive and grow. They also need an abundance of moisture, especially during the early part of the growing season. Seedlings usually occur in groups but seldom cover a large area (4). Early growth is relatively rapid but will not match that of eastern cottonwood. On a well-drained soil in southern Illinois, swamp cottonwood seedlings grew at about the same rate as silver maple seedlings. Vegetative Reproduction- Cuttings from juvenile plants will root but probably not as well as those of eastern cottonwood (4). Stumps less than 30 cm (12 in) in diameter are likely to produce sprouts.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Swamp Cottonwood,populus,heterophylla,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The largest swamp cottonwood trees on record are 35 to 40 m (115 to 130 ft) tall and 165 to 190 cm (65 to 75 in) in d.b.h. (3,8). Trees are considered mature at about 30 in (100 ft) tall and 75 to 90 cm (30 to 36 in) d.b.h. Annual height growth on poorly drained sites is slightly faster over a 30-year period than that of green ash, about 0.8 in (2.5 ft). Diameter growth on a good site in the South may approach 20 cm (8 in) in 10 years (4). Swamp cottonwood grows little after 40 or 50 years and seldom remains sound after 80 years (4). Large trees often are crooked and short boled. Trees with three merchantable logs are exceptional. Per-hectare volumes are unknown for this species since it is nearly always a single tree or grows in very small patches. Based on known volumes for eastern cottonwood (6), a pure stand of mature swamp cottonwood would likely yield 280.0 to 350.0 m³/ha (20,000 to 25,000 fbm/acre, Doyle log rule). Rooting Habit- The root system of swamp cottonwood is probably shallow like that of eastern cottonwood and most other lowland species. Poplars in general have strong horizontal surface roots from which vertical plunging roots develop. Length of horizontal roots can be considerable. Plunging roots are limited in development by the water table or soil condition. Reaction to Competition- Swamp cottonwood is classed as intolerant of shade, though probably less so than eastern cottonwood. Individuals may survive partial shade when they are young, but older trees require full sunlight. Damaging Agents- There are no reported insect or disease problems associated specifically with swamp cottonwood. But the ones that attack eastern cottonwood probably also damage swamp cottonwood. Important insect enemies include the cottonwood leaf beetle (Chrysomela scripta), cottonwood twig borer (Gypsonoma haimbachiana), poplar borer (Saperda calcarata), and the cottonwood borer (Plectrodera scalator). Among the more important diseases are Melampsora leaf rust (Melampsora medusae) and a number of canker diseases, including Septoria, Cytospora, and Fusarium (7).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Swamp Cottonwood,populus,heterophylla,hardwood,14,0
"Though most often found on heavy clays, swamp cottonwood also grows on the edges of, but not in, the muck swamps of the Southeast. Optimum growth and development is in the deep, moist soils of shallow swamps and low-lying areas near tidewater (4). Sites that are too wet for eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) will support swamp cottonwood. Examples are shallow swamps, sloughs, and very wet river bottoms where the water table remains near the soil surface for all but 2 or 3 months in the summer and early fall. In the southern part of its range, low, wet flats provide the driest sites occupied by swamp cottonwood. However, in southern Illinois it is a dominant or codominant tree on soils with available moisture varying from 3 to 21 percent for the 61- to 76-cm (24- to 30-in) layer (4). Swamp cottonwood grows naturally on at least eight major soil types common to the Midsouth: Alligator, Amagon, Arkabutla, Forestdale, Perry, Rosebloom, Sharkey, and Tensas. The soils represent several families and the orders Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols. They range from 4.6 to 5.9 in pH and from 24 to 65 percent clay in the surface 0.3 m (1 ft) (1).",Soils and Topography,Swamp Cottonwood,populus,heterophylla,hardwood,15,0
"There is no market specifically for the small volume of swamp cottonwood harvested. The wood resembles that of eastern cottonwood and is generally sold as such. Among the uses for cottonwood lumber and veneer are boxes, crates, and interior parts for furniture. Pulpwood is used in high-grade book and magazine paper. To date, few other uses have been found for the species. It is rarely cultivated for ornament, does not produce important wildlife food, and is important to flood or erosion control only in very small, localized areas. Instead of swamp cottonwood, a closely related species, eastern cottonwood, is chosen for planting because it outperforms swamp cottonwood on all except the wettest sites.",Special Uses,Swamp Cottonwood,populus,heterophylla,hardwood,16,0
"Swamp white oak is a consistent though mostly a minor component of hydromesophytic forest communities in which other species usually dominate. Tree species that commonly grow in association with swamp white oak are pin oak (Quercus palustris), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), silver maple (A. saccharinum), American elm (Ulmus americana), eastern cottonwood (Populusdeltoides), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), bur oak Quercus macrocarpa), shellbark and shagbark hickory (Carya laciniosa and C. ovata), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), black willow (Salix nigra), and American basswood (Tilia americana) (3,4,6). Swamp white oak occurs in four forest cover types: Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Society of American Foresters Type 39), Bur Oak (Type 42), Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62), and Pin Oak-Sweetgum (Type 65). It is usually found singly in these types but occasionally may be abundant in small areas (6).",Associated Forest Cover,Swamp White Oak,quercus,bicolor,hardwood,1,0

"Swamp white oak, a lowland tree, grows from southwestern Maine west to New York, southern Quebec, and southern Ontario, to central Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and southeastern Minnesota; south to Iowa and Missouri; east to Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and New Jersey. It is scattered in North Carolina and northeastern Kansas. This species is most common and reaches its largest size in western New York and northern Ohio (4). -The native range of swamp white oak.",Native Range,Swamp White Oak,quercus,bicolor,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Swamp white oak is monoecious; male and female flowers appear on the same tree in the spring at about the time leaves are one-third developed (May to June). The fruit, an acorn, matures in 1 year and is generally paired and home on slender stalks from 3 to 8 cm (1.25 to 3.25 in) long. The ovoid acorns, each 19 to 32 mm (0.75 to 1.25 in) long and 13 to 19 min (0.5 to 0.75 in) in diameter, fall during September and October. Seed Production and Dissemination- Good crops of swamp white oak occur every 3 to 5 years, with light crops during intervening years. The minimum seed-bearing age is 20 years, optimum age is 75 to 200 years, and maximum age is usually 300 years. Because the seed of swamp white oak is not dormant, it germinates soon after falling. Seed collections should be made soon after ripening in order to delay early germination. These acorns are difficult to store without germination or loss of viability occurring. Sound acorns have a germinative capacity between 78 and 98 percent. Gravity, rodents, and water are the primary dispersing agents (4,10). Seedling Development- Germination is hypogeal (10). After acorns germinate in the fall, roots continue to develop until growth is limited by low temperatures. Seedling establishment and early growth seem to be favored on the better drained lowland soils rather than on sites that are poorly drained or subjected to persistent flooding. In any case, adequate moisture and light are necessary for successful early development (4,8). Vegetative Reproduction- Like most oaks, swamp white oak produces seedling sprouts or stump sprouts when the top is cut or killed. The frequency of sprouting declines, however, with increasing d.b.h. (8):",Reproduction and Early Growth,Swamp White Oak,quercus,bicolor,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- On the better drained lowland soils, the growth rate of swamp white oak is comparable to that of white oak. The root system is usually shallow, but the tree is relatively long lived-up to 300 years or more. Normally it is a mediumsized tree, 18 to 23 in (60 to 75 ft) in height and 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 in) d.b.h., although trees up to 30 in (100 ft) tall and 213 cm (84 in) d.b.h. have been reported. Swamp white oak normally grows in mixtures with other bottom-land species and is abundant only locally. Individual old growth trees may contain as much net volume as 3.4 m³ (600 fbm) but this is uncommon (4). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- The tree is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade, and seedlings become established under moderate shade. Lowland forests in which swamp white oak grows are characterized by instability and successional uncertainty because of the variable effects of flooding, together with the presence of saturated soils. Swamp white oak may achieve dominance on the better drained lowland soils together with basswood, northern red oak (Quercus rubra), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) (8). Once established, it is able to compete effectively with American elm, green ash, and black willow. Limited current evidence indicates clearcutting to be an adequate silvicultural system, particularly on the better sites (2,8). In forest stands swamp white oak has a straight bole with ascending branches and a narrow crown. However, open-grown trees are generally poorly formed and often have persistent lower branches (4). Damaging Agents- Windthrow may be a problem especially in recently thinned stands. Disease and insects affecting swamp white oak are essentially the same as those found on white oak. Oak anthracnose can be damaging to individual trees but is generally not fatal. Swamp white oak is susceptible to the oak wilt fungus (Ceratocystis fagacearum) and in Illinois Phomopsis canker and Coniothyrium dieback were found on this oak. In addition, an Alternaria fungus was found on blighted petioles (4,7).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Swamp White Oak,quercus,bicolor,hardwood,14,0
"Throughout its range, swamp white oak is typically found on hydromorphic soils. These may be mineral soils that are imperfectly to poorly drained, as evidenced by high water tables and the presence of glei subsurface layers, or both; organic soils ranging from mucks (well decomposed) to peats (poorly decomposed) in which high water levels have favored organic accumulation; or alluvial soils underlain by a glei layer. These kinds of soils are associated with lands that are periodically inundated, such as broad stream valleys, low-lying fields, and the margins of lakes, ponds, or sloughs. Swamp white oak is not found where flooding is permanent (2,4,5,6,8). In general, the soils on which this oak most commonly is found are in the orders Entisols and Inceptisols.",Soils and Topography,Swamp White Oak,quercus,bicolor,hardwood,15,0

"Sweet birch is primarily a tree of the northeastern United States. It grows from southern Maine westward in southern Quebec, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and southeastern Ontario to eastern Ohio; and south in Pennsylvania through the Appalachian Mountains to northern Alabama and Georgia. Forest survey data indicate that sweet birch is most abundant in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania. -The native range of sweet birch. Precipitation in the range of sweet birch averages about 1140 mm (45 in) a year, about half of it falling during the growing season. In the northern part of the range, snowfall averages 200 to 250 cm (80 to 100 in) a year. Average annual temperature is about 7° C (45° F) in the north and about 13° C (56° F) in the southern Appalachians. The July average is 21° C (70° F) in New England and 23° C (74° F) in the southern Appalachians. Mean January temperatures are -9° to -7° C (15° to 20° F) in New England and -1° to 4° C (30° to 40° F) in the southern Appalachians. The growing season varies from 90 to 220 days, depending on latitude and elevation. Sweet birch grows primarily on three soil orders: Spodosols, Inceptisols, and Ultisols. It grows best on moist, well-drained soils but is also found on a variety of less favorable sites with rocky coarse-textured or shallow soils (7). Because it is occasionally abundant on rocky mountains in Pennsylvania, sweet birch may be valuable for soil protection. On other poor soils, however, such as the excessively dry portions of the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, sweet birch is partially or completely replaced by oaks and conifers. Sweet birch grows over a wide range of altitudes from near sea level along the New England coast to an upper extreme of 1220 to 1370 m (4,000 to 4,500 ft) in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In New England, the species is fairly common in southern Maine, the highlands of New Hampshire, western Vermont, the highlands of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and throughout Connecticut. In the southern Appalachians, where sweet birch grows best, the optimum elevation is between 610 and 1370 m (2,000 and 4,500 ft). Moist, protected northerly or easterly slopes are considered most favorable for sweet birch in both northern and southern parts of its range. Sweet birch is a minor species in 12 Society of American Foresters cover types (3): 19 Gray Birch-Red Maple 20 White Pine-Northern Red Oak-Red Maple 21 Eastern White Pine 22 White Pine-Hemlock 24 Hemlock-Yellow Birch 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 27 Sugar Maple 28 Black Cherry-Maple 39 Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple 57 Yellow-Poplar 58 Yellow-Poplar-Eastern Hemlock 59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak In the southern Appalachian region, sweet birch reaches its best development in Types 21, 22, 25, 57, 58, and 59. Important associated tree species include yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), basswood (Tilia spp.), white ash (Fraxinus americana), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (A. rubrum), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white birch (Betula papyrifera), gray birch (B. populifolia), hemlock (Tsuga spp.), and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Understory vegetation varies with locality, but commonly associated shrubs are mountain maple (Acer spicatum), striped maple (A. pensylvanicum), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), downy serviceberry (Amelanchier arborea), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), and eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana). Associated herbaceous vegetation includes Solomons-seal (Polygonatum pubescens), marsh blue violet (Viola cucullata), clubmosses (Lycopodium spp.), mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), trilliums (Trillium spp.), jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema atrorubens), and a variety of ferns. In former clearcut areas where young stands are established, blackberry (Rubus spp.) is abundant.",Habitat,Sweet Birch,betula,lenta,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Sweet birch flowers are monoecious and borne in catkins. Staminate catkins are formed in late summer or autumn and open in the spring after elongating to about 20 mm (0.75 in). Pistillate catkins appear with the leaves and are borne terminally on short, spurlike branches. Flowers open in April and May. Seeds ripen from about mid-August through mid-September and are contained in erect strobili (1). Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed fall is during mid-September through November. Seed dispersal is normally by wind and seeds may be blown some distance over crusted snow. Nothing is known about quantities of seeds produced or how far they are spread. Seed production begins when trees are about 40 years old; large seed crops are produced every 1 or 2 years. Cleaned sweet birch seeds average 1,367,000/kg (620,000/lb) (1). Recommended storage conditions for birch seeds are 1 to 3 percent moisture content at 2° to 3° C (36° to 38° F) (1). Stratification does not generally improve germination, but best germination is obtained when seeds are tested under light (1). Seedling Development- Under forest conditions, seeds normally germinate during the spring after they are dispersed. Nursery experience indicates that germination may extend over 4 to 6 weeks. Germination is delayed when the embryo is dormant. Moist mineral soils, rotten logs, and humus are suitable germination media. In nursery practice, birch seed is usually sown in the fall after collection in the late summer or fall. Seeds are broadcast and covered as lightly as possible or not at all if the seedbed is to be kept moist. Epigeal germination is usually complete 4 to 6 weeks after sowing. Seedlings require light shade for 2 to 3 months during the first summer. Tree percent is low; only 10 to 20 percent will produce 1-0 seedlings. Desirable seedling density is 270 to 485/m² (25 to 45/ft²). Usually 1-0 and 2-0 barerooted seedlings are planted (1). Sweet birch seedlings develop best during their early years when protected by side shade or light overhead shade. Scattered individuals frequently grow as advance reproduction in openings in mature stands or under younger stands of light to moderate crown density. In the Harvard Forest, sweet birch is sometimes present in the advance hardwood growth under old-field white pine about 50 to 70 years old (7). On fairly cool, moist sites-sheltered ravines, north to east aspects, or moderately heavy soils-heavy cutting or clearcutting of these stands generally results in a higher proportion of sweet birch in the succeeding reproduction than was present in the advance growth. On the other hand, studies in northwestern Pennsylvania have shown that clearcutting of immature second-growth northern hardwood stands before an understory has developed is followed by an abundance of intolerant species with only a poor representation of sweet birch and tolerant hardwoods (7). Vegetative Reproduction- Sweet birch has been known to reproduce well from small stumps but seems to be less prolific than many of its associates maple, sugar maple, beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow-poplar, and northern red oak. Growth and Yield- Sweet birch saplings grow relatively rapidly. The following data have been reported: In northwestern Pennsylvania, at age 12, 1.8 m (6 ft) in height; in western Pennsylvania and central West Virginia, at age 20, 14 m (46 ft) in height and 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h. On the very best sites, sweet birch grows 21 to 24 m (70 to 80 ft) tall and 61 to 152 cm (24 to 60 in) in d.b.h. In most areas, however, it is a tree of medium size, 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 ft) tall and 61 cm (24 in) or less in diameter. One of the largest trees on record is 147 cm (58 in) in d.b.h. and 21 m (70 ft) tall. According to a study in virgin hemlock-hardwood stands in northwestern Pennsylvania, sweet birch saplings in the understory grow about twice as fast as hemlock, beech, sugar maple, and red maple slightly faster than yellow birch, and at about the same rate as black cherry (Prunus serotina) (7). Data from plots on apparently average sites in Delaware County, NY, and Forest and Potter Counties, PA, show that sweet birch can attain a diameter at breast height of about 10 cm (4 in) in 20 years, 18 cm (7 in) in 40 years, and 25 cm (10 in) in 80 years (7). In unmanaged sites in the anthracite region of Pennsylvania, sweet birch reached 36 cm (14 in) d.b.h. in 85 years on high sites (Site 1) and 30 cm (12 in) in 80 years on average sites (Site 11). It is estimated that in managed stands, the same sizes would be reached in 10 to 15 years less time (7). In the Pennsylvania anthracite region, periodic cubic volume production begins to decline when the trees are 36 to 41 cm (14 to 16 in) in d.b.h. (7); that is, in about 100 years. Older trees are common and two individuals 192 and 265 years old have been found in Pennsylvania (7). Rooting Habit- No informationavailable. Reaction to Competition- Sweet birch is classed as intolerant of shade. A long, fairly dean bole is developed in dense stands, while low, thick branches are produced on open-grown trees. Sweet birch may seed in heavily after clearcutting in the Appalachian region, but a majority of the stems succumb to competition by age 20 (4). Sweet birch is one of the species that has replaced American chestnut in stands where chestnut was once a major component. Sweet birch has been reported to occupy 15 to 20 percent of the basal area of 40-year-old stands in Connecticut (12), all-aged stands in southwestern North Carolina (8), and 20-year-old even-aged stands in West Virginia. In a 70-year-old even-aged stand in West Virginia, 20 years of uneven-age management did not significantlychange the proportion of sweet birch, which remained at about 18 percent of the basal area of stems 13 cm (5 in) and larger in diameter (13). Damaging Agents- In northwestern Pennsylvania, glaze storms have caused appreciable damage to crowns of sweet birch trees. Available data indicate, however, that this species may be rated as intermediate to fairly resistant to glaze in comparison with other northern hardwoods and common associates (7). In addition to the primary effects of ice damage in directly reducing crown volume, glaze storms may contribute to the decline and subsequent death of both yellow and sweet birches by allowing wood decay organisms to enter or, possibly, by causing crown deterioration from sudden excessive exposure. Sweet birch does not seem to be very susceptible to winter killing. The severe winter of 1942-43 partly or completely killed trees of many species in Maine, but sweet birch appeared to be uninjured (7). A study of the effects of the 1930 drought on oak forests in central Pennsylvania indicated that sweet birch is intermediate in drought resistance. Drought caused mortality reduced basal area by 36 percent, for sweet birch, 11 percent for sugar maple, 50 percent for red maple, and 15 percent for white ash (7). Several fungi attack living sweet birch trees, and sterns frequently become highly defective at an early age. In unmanaged sawtimber stands in the anthracite, region of Pennsylvania, cull exceeded 20 percent of' the total cubic-foot volume of trees 43 cm (17 in) in diameter on Site 1 and 23 cm (9 in) on Site II (7). The most important pathogens are, white trunk rot (Phellinus igniarius), yellow cap fungus (Pholiota limonella), and Nectria canker (Nectria galligena) (5). Sweet birch is one of the most susceptible species to Nectria canker. Cankers on the bole are more serious than branch cankers because they reduce merchantable volume and increase susceptibility to stem breakage. Sweet birch is easily damaged by ground fires because it has extremely thin bark. Several fires may kill the tree, but even light scorching at the base of the tree will lower its resistance to the attacks of various diseases or insects such as the ambrosia beetle (Xyloterinus politus) (9). Several leaf-feeding insects occasionally infest sweet birch. The most prevalent ones are birch tubemaker (Acrobasis betulella), birch skeletonizer (Bucculatrix canadensisella), oriental moth (Cnidocampa flavescens), gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), and dusky birch sawfly (Croesus latitarsus) (6).",Life History,Sweet Birch,betula,lenta,hardwood,10,0

Lumber and veneer of the two species often are not separated in the market, although production of yellow birch far exceeds that of sweet birch. Sweet birch is used for furniture, cabinets, boxes, woodenware, handles, and millwork, such as interior finish and flush doors. Paper pulp made from sweet birch is used in various amounts with other pulps to produce such products as boxboards, book and newsprint paper, paper toweling, and corrugated paper.

"Carya glabra var. megacarpa (Sarg.) Sarg., coast pignut hickory, was once recognized as a distinct variety but is now considered to be a synonym of C. glabra (Mill.) Sweet. C. leiodermis Sarg., swamp hickory, has also been added as a synonym of C. glabra (11). Carya glabra (Mill.) Sweet var. glabra distinguishes the (typical) pignut hickory from red hickory (C. glabra var. odorata (Marsh.) Little). The taxonomic position of red hickory is controversial. The binomial C. ovalis (Wangenh.) Sarg. was published in 1913 for a segregate of C. glabra. It was reduced to a synonym of C. glabra in Little's 1953 checklist but was elevated to a variety in the 1979 edition (11). The principal difference is in the husk of the fruit, opening late and only partly, or remaining closed in C. glabra but promptly splitting to the base in C. ovalis. However, many trees are intermediate in this trait, and the recorded ranges are almost the same. The leaves of C. ovalis have mostly seven leaflets; those of C. glabra have mostly five leaflets. The two can be distinguished with certainty only in November. Since the two ranges seem to overlap, the distributions have been mapped together as a Carya glabra-ovalis complex (11). Carya ovalis has also been treated as an interspecific hybrid between C. glabra and C. ovata. C. ovalis was accepted as a polymorphic species especially variable in the size and shape of its nuts and possibly a hybrid. The relationships may be more complex after a long and reticulate phylogeny, according to detailed chemical analyses of hickory nut oils. One hybrid, C. x demareei Palmer (C. glabra x cordiformis) was described in 1937 from northeastern Arkansas.",Genetics,Sweet Pignut Hickory,carya,glabra,hardwood,7,0
"The range of pignut hickory covers nearly all of eastern United States (11). It extends from Massachusetts and the southwest corner of New Hampshire westward through southern Vermont and extreme southern Ontario to central Lower Michigan and Illinois; southward through extreme southeastern Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas to Louisiana and parts of East Texas. The species grows eastward through Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast to Mississippi and Alabama into central Florida. Best development of this species is in the lower Ohio River Basin. It is the hickory most commonly found in the Appalachian forests. Pignut makes up much of the hickory harvested in Kentucky, West Virginia, the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee, and the hill country of the Ohio Valley. -The native range of pignut hickory. Pignut hickory grows in a humid climate with an average annual precipitation of 760 to 2030 mm (30 to 80 in) of which 510 to 1020 mm (20 to 40 in) is rain during the growing season. Average snowfall varies from little to none in the South to 2540 mm (100 in) or more in the mountains of West Virginia, southeastern New York, and southern Vermont (25). Within the range of pignut hickory, average annual temperatures vary from 7° C (45° F) in the north to 21° C (70° F) in Florida. Average January temperature varies from -4° to 16° C (25° to 60° F) and average July temperature varies from 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F). Extremes of 46° and -30° C (115° and -22° F) have been recorded within the range. The growing season varies by latitude and elevation from 140 to 300 days. Mean annual relative humidity ranges from 70 to 80 percent with small monthly differences; daytime relative humidity often falls below 50 percent while nighttime humidity approaches 100 percent. Mean annual hours of sunshine range from 2,200 to 3,000. Average January sunshine varies from 100 to 200 hours, and July sunshine from 260 to 340 hours. Mean daily solar radiation ranges from 12.57 to 18.86 million J m± (300 to 450 langleys). In January daily radiation varies from 6.28 to 12.57 million J m± (150 to 300 langleys), and in July from 20.95 to 23.04 million J m± (500 to 550 langleys). According to one classification of climate (20), the range of pignut hickory south of the Ohio River, except for a small area in Florida, is designated as humid, mesothermal. That part of the range lying north of the Ohio River is designated humid, mesothermal. Part of the species range in peninsular Florida is classed as subhumid, mesothermal. Mountains in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee are classed as wet, microthermal, and mountains in South Carolina and Georgia are classed as wet, mesothermal. Throughout its range, precipitation is rated adequate during all seasons. Pignut hickory frequently grows on dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range but it is also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and Piedmont. In the Great Smoky Mountains pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a submesic class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850 ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the Great Smoky Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445 ft) of Beanfield Mountain are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak Quercus rubra), and white oak (Q. alba). This site is the most xeric habitat on the mountain because of high insolation, 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from Clinch sandstone. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200 ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (Q. prinus), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three shale formations (12). The range of pignut hickory encompasses 7 orders, 12 suborders, and 22 great groups of soils (24,25). About two-thirds of the species range is dominated by Ultisols, which are low in bases and have subsurface horizons of clay accumulation. They are usually moist but are dry during part of the warm season. Udults is the dominant suborder and Hapludults and Paleudults are the dominant great groups. These soils are derived from a variety of parent materials-sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, glacial till, and in places varying thickness of loess-which vary in age from Precambrian to Quaternary. A wide range of soil fertility exists as evidenced by soil orders-Alfisols and Mollisols which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and blackgurn (Nyssa sylvatica) (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow with lower levels of nitrogen than are required by ""nitrogen- demanding"" white ash (Fraxinus americana), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and American basswood (Tilia americana). Hickories are considered ""soil improvers"" because their leaves have a relatively high calcium content. Hickories are consistently present in the broad eastern upland climax forest association commonly called oak-hickory, but they are not generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau (23) and in second-growth forests in the Cumberland Mountains, especially on benches (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (Castanea dentata) killed by the blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) in the Appalachian Highlands (10,12). On Beanfield Mountain in Giles County, VA, the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species. Pignut hickory is an associated species in 20 of the 90 forest cover types listed by the Society of American Foresters for the eastern United States (6): Northern Forest Region 53 White Pine-Chestnut Oak Central Forest Region 40 Post Oak-Blackjack Oak 44 Chestnut Oak 45 Pitch Pine 46 Eastern Redcedar 52 White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak 53 White Oak 55 Northern Red Oak 57 Yellow-Poplar 59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak 64 Sassafras-Persimmon 110 Black Oak Southern Forest Region 75 Shortleaf Pine 76 Shortleaf Pine-Oak 78 Virginia Pine-Oak 79 Virginia Pine 80 Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine 81 Loblolly Pine 82 Loblolly Pine-Hardwood 83 Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine Because the range of pignut hickory is so extensive, it is not feasible to list the associated trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses, which vary according to elevation, topographic conditions, edaphic features, and geographic locality.",Habitat,Sweet Pignut Hickory,carya,glabra,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Hickories are monoecious and flower in the spring (3). The staminate catkins of pignut hickory are 8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from axils of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth. The pistillate flowers appear in spikes about 6 mm (0.25 in) long on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in New England. The catkins usually emerge before the pistillate flowers. The fruit of hickory is pear shaped and enclosed in a thin husk developed from the floral involucre. The fruit ripens in September and October, and seeds are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and split away from the nut into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell. Seed Production and Dissemination- Pignut hickory begins to bear seed in quantity in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; frost can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually less than half of the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate. The hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) can seriously reduce germination. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by squirrels and chipmunks. Seedling Development- Hickories exhibit embryo dormancy which is overcome naturally by overwintering in the duff and litter or artificially by stratification in a moist medium at 1° to 4° C (33° to 40° F) for 30 to 150 days. In forest tree nurseries unstratified hickory nuts are sown in the fall and stratified nuts are sown in the spring. Hickories are hypogeously germinating plants, and the nuts seldom remain viable in the forest floor for more than one winter (22). Seedling growth of hickories is slow. The following height growth of pignut hickory seedlings was reported in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade, on red clay soil (2): Vegetative Reproduction- Hickories sprout readily from stumps and roots. Stump sprouting is not as prolific as in other deciduous trees species but the sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow fairly rapidly in height. Root sprouts also are vigorous and probably more numerous than stump sprouts in cut-over areas. Small stumps sprout more frequently than large ones. Sprouts that originate at or below ground level and from small stumps are less likely to develop heartwood decay. Pignut hickory is difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Growth and Yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90 ft) tall and occasionally reaches 37 m (120 ft), with d.b.h. of 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in). The bole is often forked. Height and diameter by age are shown in table 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with chestnut oak, white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the basal area of oak-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19). Rooting Habit- Pignut hickory tends to develop a pronounced taproot with few laterals and is rated as windfirm (21). The taproot develops early, which may explain the slow growth of seedling shoots. Taproots may develop in compact and stony soils. Reaction to Competition- The hickories as a group are classed as intermediate in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant hardwoods (including the hickories) are climax, and the trend of succession toward this climax is very strong. Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26). Damaging Agents- Pignut hickory is easily damaged by fire, which causes stem degrade or loss of volume, or both. Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason why so few standing hickories meet trade specifications. Streaks result from yellow-bellied sapsucker pecking, pin knots, worm holes, and mechanical injuries. Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches. The Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 fungi and 10 other causes of diseases on Carya species (4,9). Most of the fungi are saprophytes, but a few are damaging to foliage, produce cankers, or cause trunk or root rots. The most common disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a trunk rot caused by Poria spiculosa. Cankers vary in size and appearance depending on their age. A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound. On large trees these may become prominent burl-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering. A single trunk canker near the base is a sign that the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull. Major leaf diseases are anthracnose (Gnomonia caryae) and mildew (Microstroma juglandis). The former causes brown spots with definite margins on the undersides of the leaf. These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching. Mildew invades the leaves and twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation. Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem in the management of hickory. The stem canker (Nectria galligena) produces depressed areas with concentric bark rings that develop on the trunk and branches. Affected trees are sometimes eliminated through breakage or competition and sometimes live to reach merchantable size with cull section at the canker. No special control measures are required, but cankered trees should be harvested in stand improvement operations. A gall-forming fungus species of Phomopsis can produce warty excrescences ranging from small twig galls to very large trunk burls on northern hickories and oaks. Little information is available on root diseases of hickory. More than 100 insects have been reported to infest hickory trees and wood products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and also one of the most important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During drought periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds. Logs and dying trees of several hardwood species including pignut hickory are attacked by the ambrosia beetle (Platypus quadridentatus) throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina. The false powderpost beetle (Xylobiops basilaris) attacks recently felled or dying trees, logs, or limbs with bark in the Eastern and Southern States. Hickory, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and pecan (C. illinoensis) are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked. Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success. Hickory and persimmon wood (useful in the manufacture of small products such as shuttle blocks, mallets, and mauls) is sometimes seriously damaged. Hickory is one of several host species of the twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata). Infested trees and seedlings are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive. A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are Phylloxera caryaecaulis, Caryomyia holotricha, C. sanguinolenta, and C. tubicola.",Life History,Sweet Pignut Hickory,carya,glabra,hardwood,10,0
"Hickories provide food to many kinds of wildlife (8,13). The nuts are relished by several species of squirrel and represent an estimated 10 to 25 percent of their diet. Nuts and flowers are eaten by the wild turkey and several species of songbirds. Nuts and bark are eaten by black bears, foxes, rabbits, and raccoons. Small mammals eat the nuts and leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern chipmunks is hickory nuts. White-tailed deer occasionally browse hickory leaves, twigs, and nuts. The kernel of hickory seeds is exceptionally high in crude fat, up to 70 to 80 percent in some species. Crude protein, phosphorus, and calcium contents are generally moderate to low. Crude fiber is very low. Pignut hickory makes up a small percentage of the biomass in low-quality upland hardwood stands that are prime candidates for clearcutting for chips or fuelwood as the first step toward rehabilitation to more productive stands. Hickory has a relatively high heating value and is used extensively as a home heating fuel. Pignut hickory is an important shade tree in wooded suburban areas over most of the range but is seldom planted as an ornamental tree.",Special Uses,Sweet Pignut Hickory,carya,glabra,hardwood,16,0
"Sweetbay is a major species in only one forest cover type, Sweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Society of American Foresters Type 104) (3). Also associated with this type are such hardwoods as red maple (Acer rubrum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), loblolly-bay, redbay, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), water oak Quercus nigra), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), American holly (Ilex opaca), Carolina ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), and flowering dogwood (Cornus florida); conifers such as slash pine (Pinus elliottii), pond pine (P. serotina), longleaf pine (P. palustris), loblolly pine (P. taeda), Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), and pondcypress (T. distichum var. nutans). Varying soil and moisture conditions influence the composition of this type. Sweetbay can be totally eliminated in this type by deep flooding of swamp and pond centers (15). Undergrowth of sweetbay sites is as diverse as are the soils. Some of the evergreen shrubs and small trees are buckwheat-tree (Cliftonia monophylla), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), odorless bayberry (M.inodora), dahoon (Ilex cassine), yaupon (I.vomitoria), large gallberry (I. coriacea), inkberry (I. glabra), coast leucothoe (Leucothoe axillaris), fetterbush lyonia (Lyonia lucida), staggerbush lyonia (L. mariana), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), and small switchcane (Arundinaria tecta). The deciduous shrubs commonly found are Virginia-willow (Itea virginica), hazel alder (Alnus serrulata), swamp dogwood (Cornus stricta), red chokecherry (Sorbus arbutifolia), poison-sumac (Toxicodendron vernix), American snowbell (Styrax americanus), and possumhaw viburnum (Viburnum nudum) (3). Such perennial vines as greenbriers (Smilax spp.), muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), southeast decumaria (Decumaria barbara), and climbing hempweed (Mikania scandens) may also occur. Some common herbaceous species present are ferns (Polypodium spp.), mosses (Polytrichum spp.), pitcher plants (Sarracenia spp.), pipeworts (Eriocaulon spp.), yellow-eyed grasses (Xyris spp.), and sedges (Cyperus spp.) (3).",Associated Forest Cover,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,1,0
"Rainfall per year within the geographic range of sweet bay varies from a minimum of 1220 mm (48 in) in the northern reaches of the Atlantic Coastal Plain to a maximum of 1630 mm (64 in) in some areas of the southern Gulf Coastal Plain and south Florida (13). Because of the extensive geographic range of sweetbay, the average length of the growing season extends from approximately 180 days near the northern limit of the range to about 340 days in the south. The climate is described as humid to moist subhumid with an average minimum temperature range of -23° C (-10° F) in Massachusetts to 4° C (40° F) in southern Florida (13).",Climate,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,2,0
"As previously stated, sweetbay in the northern portions of its range is basically a shrub and becomes more treelike in the southern portions of its range. There is no information readily available on race differences of sweetbay. A hybrid cultivar, Magnolia x thompsoniana, which is intermediate in character between M. virginiana and M. tripetala, is grown as a garden plant in the Eastern United States and in Europe. It was first raised in an English nursery more than 200 years ago (21). No varieties of sweetbay are recognized (14).",Genetics,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,7,0
"The range of sweetbay extends chiefly along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from Long Island south through New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania to southern Florida; west to eastern Texas, and north into southern Arkansas and southwest Tennessee; sweetbay also appears in isolated portions of eastern Massachusetts, where it may reflect only older ornamental plantings. Sweetbay is most abundant in the States of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina (13). -The native range of sweetbay.",Native Range,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- The perfect flowers of sweetbay are fragrant; they are 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 in) in diameter and 5 cm (2 in) deep. Three pale sepals surround six to nine creamy white petals. Inside the cup-shaped corolla are many stamens with purple bases, and within these stamens are many pistils spirally inserted on a spikelike receptacle (6,9). The flowers are borne singly at the ends of branches and continue to open during a period of several weeks from April into July. Pollination is by insects (20,23). The fruit is an ellipsoid or subglobose aggregate 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) long and 1.25 to 3 cm (0.5 to 1.25 in) in diameter and consists of many one- or two-seeded follicles (15,20). The fruits become ripe from July into October and are dull red, brownish red, or nearly green at maturity (2,20). At maturity, the follicles dehisce, and the 6 to 13 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in) long scarlet seeds emerge to hang suspended for a time by fine silky threads (15). Seed Production and Dissemination- Sweetbays usually produce some fruit annually, but the yields are small (11). Seed dispersal is by wind, birds, and occasionally by water and occurs soon after ripening (23). The seed of sweetbay is drupelike. The outer portion of the outer seedcoat is fleshy, oily and soft; the inner portion is stony. If seeds are to be sown soon after collection, the fleshy outer portion should be removed by maceration in water or by rubbing on hardware cloth. Cleaned seeds average about 16,600/kg (7,530/lb) (23). Seeds can be kept either cleaned or in the dried pulp for several years with little loss of viability if they are stored in sealed containers at 0° to 5° C (32° to 41° F). Seeds stored at higher temperatures should not be cleaned (23). Seedling Development- Sweetbay seeds show embryo dormancy that can be overcome by 3 to 6 months of low temperature stratification at 0° to 5° C (32° to 41° F). Various tests with stratified seeds have yielded germinative capacities averaging from 32 to 50 percent. Germination is epigeal (23). In the nursery, unstratified seeds may be sown in the fall or stratified seeds may be sown in late winter or spring. Spring sowing appears to be best in areas where depredation by rodents is a serious problem. The sown seeds should be covered with about 6 mm (0.25 in) of soil and mulch should be kept on the beds until all danger from frost is past. The emerged seedlings need half shade during much of their first summer. Normally, plantings are established with 1-0 seedlings (23). The possibilities for natural regeneration of sweetbay are greatest in natural openings or in clearcut swamps. In such openings, survival of the germinated seedlings is high unless they are inundated for an extended period. First-year growth usually averages between 30 and 60 cm (12 to 24 in). First-year seedlings are fairly tolerant of shade and competing vegetation (19). Vegetative Reproduction- Sweetbay can be propagated through layering and grafting and through cuttings treated with root-promoting chemicals (7). Sweetbay stumps produce sprouts but their vitality and growth potential are not known (18).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Sweetbay is usually smaller in diameter than the southern magnolia (15). The trunk of the tree is usually straight with small, short branches forming a narrow round-topped head and branchlets which become glabrous in their second year. Growth rate averages poor to medium (19), though it can be rapid for the first few years under favorable conditions. As a shrub, growth and form are diverse and irregular. In the more northern climates sweetbay is mainly a shrub, but it is a tree in the southern portions of the range. As a shrub, sweetbay usually attains a height between 60 and 150 cm (24 and 60 in). In the southern portions of the range the tree may range in height from approximately 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) and vary in d.b.h. from less than 10 to 90 cm (4 to 36 in). A record-size sweetbay 128 cm (50 in) in d.b.h. and 27.7 m (91 ft) tall has been recorded in Florida (1,15). Rooting Habit- No information is available on rooting habits of sweetbay. Reaction to Competition- Sweetbay is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade and to flooding as evidenced by its growth in bay heads and mixed swamps that are only seasonally shallow-flooded (16), and at the outer edges of cypress ponds that are only seasonally flooded (17). Among southern hardwoods, sweetbay is very resistant to fire; and as bark thickness increases, so does this resistance (5). Repeated burning however m eliminate sweetbay from some of the poorly drained flatwoods and Carolina bays (22). Damaging Agents- Fungal infection of sweetbay leaves is a common occurrence. Small angular spots may be found in early summer and are caused by the Cercospora stage of Mycosphaerella milleri. The ascospore stage of M. milleri may be found on overwintered, fallen leaves. M. glauca, which causes large circular leaf spots, can be found any time of the year on attached leaves. Sclerotinia gracilipes, a species confined to sweetbay, can cause the petals of the flower to rot. A light-brown stain in the wood is caused by Cephalosporium pallidum and is associated with the galleries of an ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus affinis). Ambrosia beetles usually attack sick or dying trees (8,10).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,14,0
"In the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain, sweetbay is found mainly east of the Mississippi River on sites that are usually moist throughout the year. Sweetbay sites are characterized by acid soils of low base saturation and with poor to very poor drainage and are frequently flooded during the winter or wet seasons. Trees are not usually found in bottoms of major rivers (4). Many sweetbay sites have never been cultivated and represent virgin soils. These soils are the poorly drained Ultisols, the ground water Spodosols, and Coastal Plain Histosols. Typical soils where the species is found are Bayboro and Portsmouth in South Carolina (24,25) and Bibb and Myatt soils in Alabama (4). Most of the natural range of sweetbay is less than 61 m (200 ft) above sea level, although some isolated populations exist at higher elevations. The latitudinal range of sweet bay is approximately 26° N. to 41° N. (13).",Soils and Topography,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,15,0
"Its persistent leaves, fragrant white flowers, and decorative fruit make sweetbay attractive as an ornamental shrub or tree (11). Larger trees are used for veneer and some box lumber. The tree is also utilized to some degree as pulpwood (15). Sweetbay is also a favorite food of deer and cattle. Deer browse the leaves and twigs all year. Cattle utilize sweetbay especially in the winter, when it can account for as much as 25 percent of their winter diet. Analysis of browse samples from Georgia and east Texas indicate that sweetbay contains 10 percent crude protein. The seeds are a favorite food of gray squirrels and are eaten to a lesser extent by white-footed mice, wild turkey, quail, and songbirds (11,12,15).",Special Uses,Sweetbay,magnolia,virginiana,hardwood,16,0

The lustrous green color of the fruiting heads fades to yellow as maturity is reached in September to November. The beaklike capsules open at this time, and the small winged seeds, one or two per capsule, are then readily disseminated by wind. However, the seed balls can be safely collected for seed extraction several weeks before ball discoloration occurs without harming the seed. Empty fruiting heads often remain on the trees over winter. Fair seed crops occur every year and bumper crops about every 3 years. The staminate and pistillate flowers are quite sensitive to cold and are often damaged by frost (17). Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees begin to produce seeds when 20 to 30 years old and continue production until at least 150 years of age. Seed production varies widely depending on climatic conditions during the growing season. Under optimum conditions, seed balls may average as many as 56 sound seeds per ball, or as few as 7 or 8 under less favorable conditions (16,17). Seed balls have been collected for more than 12 years at the Forestry Sciences Laboratory, Athens, GA, and scientists there expect 20 to 30 sound seeds per ball in an average year but have found as few as 5 per ball in a bad year. Low percentages of sound seed appear to be correlated with prolonged summer drought and excessive soil moisture stress during the growing season in northeast Georgia. There are approximately 365 g (0.8 lb) of clean seeds per 35 liters (1 bushel) of balls, and the number of seeds per 454 g (1 lb) varies from 65,000 to 98,400, with an average of 82,000 (17). Seed soundness may reach 80 to 90 percent in a good seed year but may drop to 10 to 20 percent in a bad seed year. There are no data relating to the number of sound seed required for normal seed-ball development. The maximum distance of seed dispersal recorded is 183 m (600 ft), but ordinarily 96 percent of the seed falls within 61 m (200 ft) of the point of release (16). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (17). Some sod covers are not a serious hindrance to seed germination but can seriously affect seedling survival during seasons of below-average rainfall. Fescue, however, has been shown to have adverse allelopathic effects on sweetgum (19). From 40 to 60 percent first-year mortality was observed on sweetgum plots overseeded with fescue in a South Carolina Piedmont site (3). The mortality at the South Carolina site was due directly to competition and was not an allelopathic response. Vegetative Reproduction- Few data are available on the early development of natural stands of sweetgum throughout its broad range. The limited, earlier data (16) indicate that workers were not aware of the tendency of sweetgum to regenerate from root sprouts that originated from suppressed root buds (11). Stand disturbances thought to produce ideal seedbed conditions were actually optimum conditions for suppressed bud release and subsequent root sprout development. A South Carolina Coastal Plain area thought to have been successfully regenerated with sweetgum seed trees was later found to be regenerated primarily from root sprouts (4,7, 11). The importance of root sprout formation with sweetgum regeneration is evident from observations made in natural stands of mixed pines and hardwoods in the Georgia Piedmont that have been logged for sawtimber. In most of the stands examined, advance reproduction of sweetgum was clearly evident, accounting for 10 to 60 percent of all hardwood production. The invasion of such stands by young sweetgum has usually been attributed to natural seeding, but most of the young, vigorously growing stems observed in the Georgia Piedmont were of sprout origin. It is not uncommon to find as many as 40 or more stems from seedling to sapling size on the root systems of a single parent tree. Additional work with root sprouts in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina showed that sprout height after 8 years was directly correlated with the diameter of the lateral root from which the sprout originated; the larger the root the taller the sprout. The persistence of root sprouts was revealed when soil was removed from several 0.04-ha (0.1-acre) plots on a Georgia Piedmont bottom-land site that supported pure stands of sweetgum. Trees ranged in d.b.h. from about 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 in) and varied from dominant to intermediate in the crown canopy. More than 70 percent of the trees were of sprout origin on most plots. Other stands that were primarily of seed origin were later found on abandoned agricultural lands. These observations indicate that a significant portion of sweetgum regeneration following logging can be expected to originate from root sprouts. The long-term development and management of these stands have yet to be clarified. Plantation establishment of sweetgum is becoming increasingly important throughout the southern region, and it is rapidly becoming the hardwood species most commonly established. Results of early plantation establishment and development have been quite variable. This variability in growth has been attributed to seedling quality. Seedlings with a large root-collar diameter achieve the best growth, and planting seedlings with a root-collar diameter of less than 6 mm (0.25 in) is not recommended (2). In a Georgia Piedmont bottom-land site, seedlings at age 7 ranged in height from 3.8 to 6.2 in (12.4 to 20.2 ft). After 7 years on a strip mine in Indiana, sweetgum averaged 2.1 in (7 ft). On favorable sites in the lower Mississippi Valley, seedling height growth of 0.6 m/yr (2 ft/yr) has been reported. On upland sites, 5-year height growth varies considerably, from 1.1 in (3.6 ft) on an eroded field to 2.0 in (6.5 ft) on areas reverting to woody cover. It is this slow, early growth of sweetgum plantations that is of concern to silviculturists because it necessitates expensive cultivation to reduce weed competition and thereby maintain acceptable survival until height growth begins. First-order lateral root morphology of nursery-lifted sweetgum seedlings reflects their future competitiveness in the field. Early growth and survival can be acceptable, even in moderate to severe drought years, if nursery-lifted seedlings have five or more first-order lateral roots exceeding 1 mm (0.04 in) in diameter at the junction with the taproot. As many as one third of all seedlings in selected families growing in one nursery did not meet these standards making them poorly competitive in a forest environment (10). Recent work suggests that vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae can significantly improve seedling quality from nurseries (9,13,14) and alter this pattern of low growth so commonly encountered during the first 3- to 5-year period following plantation establishment. On an upland Piedmont site in South Carolina, for example, total heights on sweetgum plots after three growing seasons have been observed to exceed the 2.0 in (6.5 ft) reported after five growing seasons from areas just reverting to woody cover. On a denuded borrow pit in the South Carolina Piedmont, soil amended with as little as 13 mm (0.5 in) of sewage sludge evenly distributed and disked into the soil resulted in fourth-year height of 2.8 in (9.2 ft) for sweetgum (3). The seedlings used in this experiment were heavily mycorrhizal with a vesicular-arbuscular fungus (Glomus mosseae) at outplanting.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sweetgum,liquidambar,styraciflua,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Young sweetgum have a strong excurrent growth habit and long, conical crowns that usually prune themselves readily under forest conditions. There is a wide range in branch angle from acute to almost 90' in young trees. Depending on site quality, and at a definite stage in development, sweetgum. becomes decurrent as the trees mature, and the crown becomes rounded and wide spreading. The tops of overmature trees are usually broken or stag headed. The excurrent growth habit is maintained longer on the more moist, fertile bottom-land sites than on the drier, less fertile upland sites. However, on excessively dry sites the excurrent growth habit is characteristically maintained for many years and may represent a morphological growth response mediated by moisture availability. The average 10-year diameter growth for overmature sweetgum in the southern region was reported to be 4.8 cm (1.9 in), and for immature trees of medium to high vigor, 8.9 cm (3.5 in) (16). In the Mississippi Delta, pure stands of sweetgum average 84 to 112 m³ /ha (6,000 to 8,000 fbm/acre). Very good stands have 210 to 280 m³/ha (15,000 to 20,000 fbm/acre) with up to 420 to 560 m³ /ha (30,000 to 40,000 fbm/acre) on small, selected areas. On ridges and upland sites, stands are usually less dense than on bottom-land sites. Rooting Habit- Early root development varies with site conditions. On well-drained bottom-land sites a deep taproot with numerous well-developed laterals usually develops rapidly. On wet sites with poor drainage, however, the root system is shallow and wide spreading, with little tendency shown for taproot development. On gravelly ridges, hillsides, and upland piedmont sites, sweetgum develops a particularly strong taproot and is very resistant to wind (16). Reaction to Competition- Sweetgum is most accurately classed as intolerant of shade. It must have adequate sunlight to reach its potential. Young sweetgum are able to endure some crowding in pure stands on bottom lands. With increasing age, however, they become less able to endure competition and may respond poorly to release because crown regeneration capacity is reduced. Sweetgum of all vigor classes tend to develop epicormic branches when stands are thinned excessively. Moderate thinnings stimulate epicormic branches, primarily on trees with light to moderate crown development (12). On upland sites in the southern and southeastern regions, sweetgum seedlings or sprouts are often present in the pine forest understory. Removal of the pine overstory usually results in rapid growth of the sweetgum. This response may be attributed to logging damage to the original understory stems, which then resprout and grow rapidly without overhead competition. Damaging Agents- Few severe diseases are associated with sweetgum, but small mammals and grazing animals have caused isolated problems. Seedlings may be badly damaged by hogs, goats, or cattle in different areas. Rodents, particularly mice, and rabbits have caused considerable damage to young plantations in several areas (16). Beavers in the Georgia Piedmont cause impoundments and girdle healthy trees. Fire may be one of the major agents of damage to this species. Summer fires damage young sweetgum more than winter fires. Fire scars on living trees furnish entrance points for both insects and diseases. As long as the sapwood is not killed by fire, basal wounds are often covered with a gum exudation that protects them. With repeated fires, however, a tree is apt to have some sapwood killed, and fungi and insects may become established. In the lower delta of the Mississippi River, 42 percent of the sweetgum trees burned once showed decay 8 years later; 79 percent of the trees burned repeatedly during an 8-year period showed decay (16). The four most common decay organisms reported in the Mississippi River Delta were Fomes geotropus, Pleurotus ostreatus, Lentinus trigrinus, and Ganoderma lucidum (16). Other diseases of sweetgum that may be important occasionally are an abiotic leader dieback or blight, twig canker, and trunk lesion caused by Botryosphaeria ribis, and bleeding necrosis, which may be a combination of sweetgum blight and B. ribis trunk lesion (8). Of these, only sweetgum blight is widely distributed and has caused heavy mortality in several States. It has received intensive study in Maryland and Mississippi. Drought appears to be the primary cause. In the lower Mississippi River flood plain, blight severity was found to be correlated with soil properties affecting moisture supply. Severity of dieback was reduced by 68 percent in 2 years by irrigating when soil moisture dropped below 40 percent of field capacity (16). There is a good possibility that sweetgum blight is most common in stands of root sprout origin. In the Georgia Piedmont and Coastal Plain of South Carolina, many groups of trees are composed of stems that are of root sprout origin and depend on a single root system complex for water uptake. During prolonged droughts such as occurred in the 1950's, this limited root system may not be adequate to satisfy the water requirements of the sprout complex, and many of the stressed trees may suffer blight. Except for leaffeeders, insects usually attack only trees that are already damaged, decadent, or dead. These include the bark beetles (Dryocoetes betulae and Pityophthorus liquidambarus), the ambrosia beetles, which include Platypus compositus, and the darkling beetles (Strongylium spp.). The leaffeeders include the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and the luna moth (Actias luna) (1). In addition, a treehopper (Strictocephala militaris) is known to spend its entire life cycle on sweetgum in northeast Georgia but is not considered to be harmful (5).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sweetgum,liquidambar,styraciflua,hardwood,14,0
"Sweetgum is perhaps one of the most adaptable hardwood species in its tolerance to different soil and site conditions. As is characteristic of most hardwood species, it grows best on the moist alluvial clay and loamy soils of river bottoms, but its growth rate is commercially acceptable on a wide range of Piedmont and Coastal Plain soils. Throughout the Piedmont Plateau, sweetgum makes good growth on the river and stream bottoms and shows considerable potential on many upland sites. In the Carolina and Georgia Piedmont, for example, it is exceptionally competitive with other tree species on a wide range of soils with a site index for loblolly pine of 75 (at age 50) or greater. In Maryland, sweetgum rarely makes acceptable growth on clay or gravelly clay upland soils and is rarely found on well-drained, sandy soils. Best growth rates are obtained on alluvial swamp sites and on imperfectly and poorly drained soils having a high clay content. In the lower Mississippi Valley, site quality for sweetgum increases with the amount of exchangeable potassium in the soil and decreases as clay percentage increases. The best sites are those with medium-textured soils without a hardpan in the top 61 cm (24 in) and with moderate to good internal drainage. In the Mississippi Delta, sweetgum is most common on silty clay or silty clay loam ridges and silty clay flats in the first bottoms, which are very moist, but not too poorly drained. Along the eastern border of the Mississippi River, sweetgum is occasionally dominant on the loessial soils of the alluvial flood plain. It is characteristically dominant on the relatively impervious Alfisols of the Illinoian till plain, including the very poorly drained Avonburg, Blanchester, and Clermont silt loams (16).",Soils and Topography,Sweetgum,liquidambar,styraciflua,hardwood,15,0
"Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, railroad ties, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, radio-, television-, and phonograph cabinets, interior trim, and millwork. The veneer and plywood are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork (18).",Special Uses,Sweetgum,liquidambar,styraciflua,hardwood,16,0
"Sycamore grows singly or in small groups with other trees but seldom in extensive pure stands in the northern part of its range. In the Mississippi bottom lands of the South, however, it does grow in pure stands of 16 to 40 ha (40 to 100 acres). Sycamore is the predominant tree in two forest cover types (7). In River Birch-Sycamore (Society of American Foresters Type 61) the associate trees include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), red maple (Acer rubrum), black willow (Salix nigra), and other moist-site hardwoods. This type is widespread, occurring in southern New England, southern New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, southern parts of the Lake States, and south into Oklahoma, Missouri, and Tennessee. It is also found in the Allegheny and Piedmont Plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains. In Sycamore-Sweetgurn-American Elm (Type 94), the chief associates are boxelder (Acer negundo), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), silver maple (A. saccharinum), eastern cottonwood, black willow, water oak (Quercus nigra), Nuttall oak (Q. nuttallii), sweetgum, and river birch (Betula nigra). This type is found throughout the southern part of the range of sycamore, usually on the alluvial flood plains of major rivers. A Sycamore-Pecan-American Elm valiant type is found on river fronts in the Mississippi River Valley. A comprehensive survey of mixed hardwood species conducted in 14 Southeastern States by North Carolina State University showed that sycamore comprised 0.1 percent of the total basal area on wet flat sites, from 0.5 to 8.8 percent on various classes of bottom-land sites, 0.7 percent on lower slope coves, and 0.1 percent on upland slopes and ridges (26). Other forest types with which sycamore grows are Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple (Type 39) in the northern part of the sycamore range, Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Type 93) in the South, Sweetgum-Yellow-Poplar (Type 87) in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Piedmont, and Black Willow (Type 95), which grows throughout the range of sycamore. Sycamore is also an important tree in Cottonwood (Type 63), a valuable pioneer type, characteristic of fronts on all major streams in the South except in sloughs and swamps (21).",Associated Forest Cover,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,1,0
"Within the range of sycamore, average annual temperatures vary from 4° to 21° C (40° to 70 ° F), with average annual extremes from 41° to -34° C (105° to -30° F); the lowest temperature recorded was -40° C (-40° F). Average annual precipitation varies from 760 to 2030 mm (30 to 80 in), and the frost-free period is from 100 to 300 days. The natural occurrence of this species in eastern North America is probably limited in the North by frosts and low temperatures, and in the West by the dry climate of the Great Plains.",Climate,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,2,0
"Genetic experiments with sycamore in the eastern United States have demonstrated heritable variation in growth and other traits (8,13,24,29,31). Tree improvement programs are in progress (20) and genetic gains in early growth rate have been obtained (13,31). Geographic variation in sycamore is extensive, and, noted in many other widely distributed species, trees of southern origin have a potential for faster growth than trees of more northern origin when planted near or slightly north of their point of origin (8,13,24,29,31). Sycamore is unique among North American tree species in displaying a strong north-south gradient in resistance to a killing stem canker disease. In two progeny tests of half-sib families selected along the Mississippi and Chattahoochie Rivers, families of northern origin (Missouri and northern Georgia) were attacked much more severely than were families from farther south (southern Georgia and Louisiana) (5). Two varieties of sycamore have been named in addition to the typical variety. P. occidentalis var. glabrata is common in western Texas and Mexico but is considered by some taxonomists to be synonymous with the typical variety. P. occidentalis var. attenuata is apparently intermixed with the typical variety, but its status is in need of clarification. The London plane of the Old World, P. x acerifolia, is considered a collection of advanced generation hybrids and backcrosses between P. orientalis and P. occidentalis (12). London plane is an important street tree in cities of the United States and Europe because of its resistance to diseases and especially the air pollution found in the urban environment.",Genetics,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,7,0
"Sycamore grows in all States east of the Great Plains except Minnesota. Its native range extends from southwestern Maine west to New York, extreme southern Ontario, central Michigan, and southern Wisconsin; south in Iowa and eastern Nebraska to eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, and south-central Texas; east to northwestern Florida and southeastern Georgia. It is also found in the mountains of northeastern Mexico. -The native range of sycamore.",Native Range,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Sycamore is monoecious; the male flower clusters grow on short stalks on branchlets of the previous year and the female flower clusters grow on short stalks on older branchlets. They appear in May in the North and as early as late March in the South. The fruit is a ball composed of many closely packed, long, narrow fruits that ripen by September or October and often remain on the tree over winter, breaking up or falling off the following spring. The seed is an achene with a light-brown, hairy, thin but hard seedcoat. Seed Production and Dissemination- Plantation-or open-grown sycamore begins to bear seeds in 6 or 7 years. Dense natural stands begin to produce an appreciable number of seeds at about 25 years, with optimum production between 50 and 200 years. Generally, sycamore is not dependable for seed after the age of 250 years. The tree usually bears good seed crops every 1 or 2 years and some seeds are produced every year. Late spring frosts commonly kill the flowers, leaves, and even the twigs, reducing seed production (21). Sycamore seeds average about 441,000/kg (200,000/lb) and are dispersed from February through May of the spring following ripening. As the seed balls break up, the seeds are released and float down slowly. The hairs act as parachutes, and the seeds are widely scattered by the wind. Several birds feed on the seeds and also may disseminate them to a minor extent. Moreover, the seeds are carried by water and are often deposited on mudflats or sandbars where conditions are usually favorable for germination (21). Seedling Development- Pregermination treatments are not required (3). A large percentage of sound seeds usually germinate, but the great variation in number of sound seeds in a lot results in a wide range of germinative capacity. Germination is epigeal and is affected by light. In tests made at temperatures ranging between 23° to 27° C (73° to 810 F), the mean germination under artificial light was 17.5 percent and only 3.1 percent in the dark (21). Seeds failed to germinate in the river-bottom soils of southern Illinois wherever litter was more than 2 inches deep. Sycamore seedlings must have direct light to survive; under favorable conditions they develop a strong, spreading root system and grow rapidly, as much as 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in) in height the first year. Roots also penetrate deeper in loess soil than in alluvial or clay soils. Vegetative Reproduction- Sycamore sprouts readily from the stump when young (sapling or pole size) and the species has good potential for coppice regeneration, especially in short-rotation biomass plantings (27). The best coppice reproduction has been obtained by late dormant-season March harvesting (23). Slips or cuttings made from young, fast-growing stems root readily and may be used for propagation. Healthier top growth has been noted on cuttings that were made closer to the root collars than other parts of the stem, and fall-planted cuttings grew better than those planted in the spring (21). Cuttings from mature trees cannot be rooted by conventional methods, but a modified air-layering technique consisting of girdling and application of growth-promoting hormones on the tree before the cuttings are taken has been successful (10).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Sycamore grows fast throughout its life. Within its range, only cottonwood and, under some conditions, a few of the pines, soft maples, and black willow grow faster. Average 10-year diameter growth rates for sycamore of three size classes in five States were as follows (21): These are average growth rates for a range of sites and should not be considered as indicative of growth that might be expected on either poor or good sites. Sycamore in a 17-year-old North Carolina stand had an average d.b.h. of more than 23 cm (9 in) and an average height of 21.3 in (70 ft). There was a total volume of 126 m³/ha (1,800 ft³/acre) or 32.3 m³/ha (2,310 fbm/acre) of sawtimber plus 75.6 m³/ha (1,080 ft³/acre) of pulpwood. This stand was expected to have a volume of 140 m³/ha (10,000 fbm/acre) of sawtimber by age 22 (21). This figure is slightly higher than average yield for mixed hardwoods in the southeastern United States. Annual hardwood yields in the major bottom-land type (where sycamore made up 8.8 percent of the stand) were found to average about 4.0 m³/ha (57 ft³/acre) in stands from 20 to 60 years old (26). The potential for plantation-grown sycamore seems much higher than the yields for natural stands. A survey conducted by North Carolina State University found that annual plantation yields ranged from 7.7 m³/ha (110 ft³/acre) at age 5, to 14.3 m³/ha (204 ft³/acre) at age 25 (25). Most of the plantations in this survey were not cultivated to optimum intensity after establishment and in all likelihood do not represent the ultimate or even the practical maximum attainable yield. Annual yield at age 11 in a sycamore plantation in central Georgia was 17.2 m³/ha (245 ft³ /acre). Average d.b.h. was 15 cm (6 in) and average height was 19 in (63 ft) (2). The highest yields for sycamore under intensive culture were recorded on a ""creek bottom-land site"" in the Georgia Piedmont (14) and in the lower Mississippi River Valley for 4-year coppice rotation following 3 or 4 years in seedling rotation (6). Annual yields were from 24 to 32 m³/ha (343 ft³/acre). This yield is comparable to maximum yields obtained with other fast-growing genera such as Populus and Alnus that have been grown on ""mini-rotations"" (4). The American sycamore grows to a larger diameter than any other North American hardwood. Trees are on record that exceeded 305 cm (120 in) in d.b.h. and 43 ni (140 ft) in height (21). An individual tree in Indiana was 320 cm (126 in) in diameter at 1.2 in (4 ft) above the ground and 51 ni (168 ft) tall (21). Open-grown sycamores have a large irregular crown that may spread to 30 ni (100 ft) in diameter. Under forest conditions the tree has a relatively small crown and a long, slightly tapered bole that may be clear of branches for 20 or 25 m (70 or 80 ft). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Sycamore is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade and in competitive ability. It can compete successfully with cottonwood and willow, which it replaces or succeeds unless special steps are taken to favor these trees (21). In the Piedmont of North Carolina, sycamore and birch tend to replace pioneer trees like alder and willow on small islands or spits in streams after this land becomes stable and drained (21). Sycamore and birch, in turn, are usually succeeded by elm (Ulmus spp.), ash, and red maple. It was found, however, that sycamore seedlings grown under controlled light were at least as tolerant as American and winged elm (U. americana and U. alata) on the basis of observed height growth and top-to-root ratios (21). On sand and gravel bars and on flood plains in Missouri, sycamore is a pioneer tree that persists throughout later successional stages in the sugar maple-bitternut hickory variant of Sugar Maple (Type 27) (21). This variant grows on wet sites where the soils are usually neutral to calcareous. Sycamore is also found in forest types that are pioneer, transitional, subclimax, and climax in the succession. On moist or wet sites in subclimax, deciduous forests it grows in association with oaks, black walnut (Juglans nigra), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), sweetgum, cottonwood, and willow. It seems able to maintain itself in some of these subclimax and climax forest types because of its rapid growth and longevity. Usually it maintains a position in subclimax types only when they are in bottom land or other moist situations. On dryer sites sycamore usually has only pioneer or transitional status and is eventually replaced by tolerant trees or trees having less demanding moisture requirements. Epicormic sprouting is not a serious problem in sycamore. Pruning widely spaced, open-grown natural trees 9 years old did not result in serious sprouting. In a Georgia thinning study, epicormic branching of sycamore was appreciable only where basal area was reduced to less than 18.4 m²/ha (80 ft²/acre), which was two-thirds or less of the original basal area. Heavier thinning resulted in 14 to 15 epicormic branches per tree (21). Damaging Agents- Many insects feed on sycamore but none are of economic importance in forests. Some may, however, seriously damage individual trees planted for landscaping purposes. Probably the insects that attack sycamore do not kill healthy trees, but when they attack a tree of reduced vigor, they may cause severe injury or death. The more important insects are the sycamore lacebug (Corythuca ciliata), the flathead sycamore-heartwood borer (Chalcophorella campestris), and the sycamore tussock moth (Halisidota harrisii). Other insect enemies include leaf feeders and hoppers, periodical cicada (Magicicada septendecim), aphids, scales, crosswood borers, flatheaded borers, roundheaded borers, bark borers, darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae), ambrosia beetles, moths, and caterpillars, leaf rollers, and horntails (Siricoidea). Sycamore is also subject to ant attacks, which often cause ingrown bark pockets that reduce the quality of the wood (21). Diseases of sycamore have become more important with its increased culture in plantations. In the mid-1970's, potentially serious infection involving leaf scorch, dead branches, top dieback, and lethal cankers occurred in Illinois and adjacent States (22). A 1973 survey of 26 plantations in Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama revealed leaf scorch, top dieback, and lethal bole cankers in four bottom-land plantations (9). In two progeny tests in Mississippi the same symptoms were evident, so severely in one test that it was a total loss within 5 years (5). The primary organism causing lethal bole cankers has not been established. A complex of organisms seems to be involved, but Ceratocystis fimbriata and Botryodiplodia theobromae are prime suspects. When seedlings were inoculated with either of these organisms by the bark-flap technique, cankers developed on the stem within 30 days; when 8-year-old trees were inoculated with Ceratocystis fimbriata, cankers appeared and some trees died within a year (19). Temperature also seems to be a factor (15,16,17). Acremonium diospyri has also been identified in trees displaying these symptoms. Sycamore is susceptible to anthracnose, the same disease that attacks oaks (21). This fungus attacks in the spring and sometimes completely defoliates the trees. Severe attacks also kill twigs, and frequently cankers are formed up to 25 mm (1 in) in diameter. Usually, a second set of leaves is produced following defoliation and few trees die from an attack. Anthracnose may weaken a tree, however, making it susceptible to attack by other diseases. Heavy attacks by this disease also reduce radial and terminal growth. Sycamore is host to the eastern mistletoe (Phoradendron spp.) but damage usually is not serious. Weather damage and damage caused by insects and disease are commonly confused. For example, anthracnose attacks are often mistaken for frost damage. Although low winter temperature may injure the cork cambium and cause the outer bark to be sloughed off, the health of the tree is not affected. Late spring frosts may kill sycamore buds over a wide area, and where this occurs, the damaged trees characteristically have long dead twigs with bushy masses of leaves around their bases by midsummer. A limited study of sycamore shade trees following a sleet storm in west-central Illinois indicated that the tree is susceptible to ice damage (21). But in forest stands, it is seldom damaged by such storms. Because it develops a widespread, strongly branched root system, sycamore is a windfirm tree. However, large sycamores are likely to develop windshake, a wood defect that reduces their value for lumber and other products.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,14,0
"Sycamore is most common and reaches its largest size on alluvial soils along streams and in bottom lands. It is found most commonly on Entisols, Inceptisols, and Alfisols, and occasionally on Vertisols, Histosols, and Mollisols. The tree is tolerant of wet soil conditions, and in the northern part of its range it grows on the edge of streams and lakes and small depressions having slow drainage, as well as on wet muck land, shallow peat soils, and soils associated with river bottoms and flood plains. Farther south it commonly grows on the alluvial soils of flood plains adjacent to larger rivers, on former streambanks except in sloughs and swamps (21), and in the moist coves, lower slopes, and ravines. In general, this tree grows best on sandy loams or loam with a good supply of ground water, typically on the edges of lakes and streams when the summer water table drops enough to permit good soil aeration during the growing season (18). Sycamore is relatively intolerant of flooding during the growing season and will die if the entire tree is inundated for more than 2 weeks. Sometimes sycamore is a pioneer tree on upland old-field sites. This is particularly true in the central part of its range. In the South, however, it rarely grows on old fields or even on well-drained ridges in the first bottoms. Although sycamore becomes established on old eroded fields, it seldom grows well on these sites. On 60 old fields in southeastern Ohio, it was a minor constituent of the tree reproduction (21). However, it is sometimes found in excellently stocked natural stands on coal-stripped land of the Central States. In Missouri, too, sycamore is often found in pure stands or in mixture with other hardwoods that volunteer on spoil banks (21), and it is one of the pioneer species on the ridges of strip-mined land in Vermillion County, IL. It is recommended for planting on all types of coal-stripped land in many of the Northeast and Central States (21). In Tennessee, sycamore prospers in well-drained, gravelly and cherty, terrace soils, in a heavy weed cover (21). It grows at elevations from just above sea level in some sections to 305 in (1,000 ft) in the northern part and 762 in (2,500 ft) in the southern part of the Appalachian Mountains. It also is found in coves, on lower east and north slopes, and on the moist soils of steep slopes and ravines facing major stream bottoms.",Soils and Topography,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,15,0
"Establishment of sycamore plantations increased during the 1960's and 1970's. As of 1979, about 1500 ha/yr (3,700 acre/year) were being planted to sycamore of a total 4170 ha/yr (10,300 acre/yr) of hardwoods planted in the Southeast (30). In general, establishment of these plantations has been characterized by intensive site preparation, cultivation and fertilization for several years after planting, high initial costs, and fast growth. Sycamore has fast initial growth rate on a wide range of sites, including relatively infertile ""pine"" sites. After only a few years, however, its growth declines and it stagnates on the less fertile sites unless fertilizer is added. Some plantations have been established at very close spacing and are being reproduced by coppice on short rotations in a silvicultural scheme aimed at maximum fiber production. This kind of culture has been termed ""short-rotation forestry"" (27) or ""silvicultural biomass farms"" (11). The entire aboveground portion of the plant is harvested and estimates of annual biomass production in parts of the United States range from 11.2 to 29.1 dry ton equivalents/ha (5 to 13 dry ton equivalents/acre) at rotations of 4 to 10 years (4). Nutrient drain on the site is greater than with conventional long rotation management (1,32) and fertilization is usually necessary, especially with rotations shorter than 5 years (28). In spite of the high initial cost, one analysis in the Coastal Plain of Virginia and North Carolina estimated that over a 36-year period (three 12-year coppice rotations) total yield of four hardwood species including sycamore would be increased at least 50 percent over natural stands at one-third the cost of a system of natural regeneration (20).",Special Uses,Sycamore,platanus,occidentalis,hardwood,16,0
"In Table Mountain pine stands of the Great Smoky Mountains associated tree species are red maple (Acer rubrum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), pitch pine (Pinus rigida), and chestnut oak Quercus prinus). In Table Mountain pine-pitch pine stands, additional associated species include scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), American chestnut (Castanea dentata), and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) (16). Table Mountain pine is also a minor associate in five forest cover types: Pitch Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 45), Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Chestnut Oak (Type 44), White Pine-Chestnut Oak (Type 51), and Virginia Pine-Oak (Type 78) (13). In the Shortleaf Pine type, Table Mountain pine is included only in the mountains; other associates are pitch pine, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), black, white, southern red, scarlet, chestnut, post, and blackjack oaks Quercus velutina, Q. alba, Q. falcata, Q. coccinea, Q. prinus, Q. stellata, and Q. marilandica, respectively), hickories (Carya spp.), and blackgum. In the Virginia Pine-Oak type, associated species in the foothills include shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and pitch pine, black, white, scarlet, chestnut, post, and blackjack oaks, hickories, and blackgum (13,30,31). The lower canopy vegetation in Table Mountain pine stands (8,16,31) includes rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum), Catawba rhododendron (R. catawbiense), Piedmont rhododendron (R. minus), mountain-laurel (Kalmia latifolia), mountain winterberry (Ilex montana), hobblebush (Viburnum alnifolium), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), sawbrier (Smilax glauca), greenbrier (S. rotundifolia), fetterbush (Pieris floribunda), white-alder (Clethra acuminata), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), bear huckleberry (G. ursina), wild grape (Vitis spp.), and male blueberry (Lyonia ligustrina). Mean shrub cover in the Great Smoky Mountains amounted to 65 percent in Table Mountain pine stands and 84 percent in Table Mountain pine-pitch pine stands. Bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia), mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium), and low sweet blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) are most important stand components only in the northern part of the range of Table Mountain pine. Among tree species, black oak is important only in the north; blackjack oak and sourwood, in the south. Black birch (Betula lenta) is an associate only on rocky, nonshale areas, but Virginia pine is an associate at lower elevations, especially on shale. The evergreens, trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens) and galax (Galax aphylla), are important only south of Virginia. Understory species in Table Mountain pine stands stabilize the shallow soil surrounding the pines.",Associated Forest Cover,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,1,1
"Precipitation within the range of Table Mountain pine varies with latitude and elevation. Warm season rainfall from April through September varies annually from 460 to 610 mm (18 to 24 in) in Pennsylvania to 690 to 990 mm (27 to 39 in) in the Southern Appalachians (27). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 mm (30 in) in Pennsylvania to more than 2030 mm (80 in) in the Great Smoky Mountains. At the northern end of the range, average July temperature varies from 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F); in the Great Smoky Mountains, the range is 15° to 21° C (60° to 70° F). Average January temperatures in Pennsylvania range from -7° to -1° C (20° to 30° F); in the Great Smoky Mountains, 2° to 5° C (35° to 40° F). In Pennsylvania, the average number of frost-free days varies from 150 to 170, and in the mountains of Tennessee, North Carolina, and north Georgia, from 170 to 180.",Climate,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,2,1
"Racial variation, if any, among Table Mountain pines is not known. Two hybrids of Table Mountain pine are known Pinus pungens x P. echinata and P. pungens x P. rigida. In the former, the needles are long and there are two or three as in shortleaf pine, rather than the two, mostly intermediate in width, and twisted as in Table Mountain pine (12). Needles of Table Mountain pine are stiff and prickly, while those of shortleaf pine are flexible; the intermediate needles of the hybrid are stiff and short pointed, but not prickly. The cones are small as in shortleaf pine, but intermediate, and more like Table Mountain pine in keel of apophysis and spine length. A P. pungens x P. rigida natural hybrid from Pisgah Ridge in Henderson County, NC, had external needle characteristics of Table Mountain pine, a cone intermediate in size and development of apophysis and umbo, and a dense group of short, small-diameter branches about 4.6 m (15 ft) up the bole, suggesting the sprouting characteristics of pitch pine (31).",Hybrids,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,9,1
"Table Mountain pine, an Appalachian endemic, grows almost entirely within the range of pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and Virginia pine (P. virginiana), but is less frequent. In general, Table Mountain pine occupies xeric sites of Appalachian rocky and shaly mountainous areas from Georgia into Pennsylvania (8,16,17,29,31). It is frequently found on ridges of the precipitous gorges that dissect the Blue Ridge Mountains. Table Mountain pine is unevenly distributed; its range extends from the Northern Appalachians in central Pennsylvania southwest to eastern West Virginia and southward into the Southern Appalachians, ending on the steep western edge of the mountains of North Carolina and east Tennessee (1,2,6,9,10,11,19,25,29). To the east and south, its range includes the crest and eastern escarpment of the prominent Blue Ridge Front with its numerous rocky gorges and torrential mountain streams. Toward the southern end of its range, Table Mountain pine reaches its highest elevation of 1760 m (5,780 ft) in the Great Smoky Mountains (8,16,29). There are numerous outlying populations of Table Mountain pine to the east and a few to the west of the Appalachians; many outliers are associated with monadnocks which rise considerably higher than the surrounding Piedmont (5,6,23,24,30). - The native range of Table Mountain pine.",Native Range,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,11,1
"The length-width ratio of Table Mountain pine needles is higher south of latitude 37° N. than north (31). Stands in which most cones open the first and second year after ripening are in the northern end of its range. Seed weight is negatively correlated with elevation, but seedcoat characteristics and cotyledon number are not. There is no difference in specific gravity (0.470 unextracted cores) of Table Mountain pine over its natural geographic range (12). In the Appalachian Mountains of southwest Virginia, in three stands of Table Mountain pine, as far as 42 km (26 mi) apart, there were significant differences in needle length, number of stomatal rows, and needle margin serrulations among trees and half-sib progeny within each stand (14). In seedlings grown from seed from trees in the three stands, no significant differences among stands were observed for any of the characteristics measured.",Population Differences,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,12,1
"Table Mountain pine needs stand and site disturbance, light, and heat for successful regeneration. In closed stands on western and northern exposures, Table Mountain pine cones are distinctly serotinous, but on southerly and easterly exposures many cones open soon after maturing. A large number of closed cones remain on the trees from 5 to 25 years and the retained seeds remain viable for 9 or more years (21,32). After logging, residual trees are exposed to increased light and heat favorable for cone opening and seed dissemination. Often as much as 80 percent of the reproduction on logged-over areas is Table Mountain pine. In undisturbed stands, pine reproduction is periodic and often in scattered patches (16,29,31). In Table Mountain pine-pitch pine stands under undisturbed conditions, especially without fire, successional trends toward increases in red maple, blackgum, and various oaks have been noted in the Great Smoky Mountains, with successional change strongest at lower elevations. In addition, the typical heavy heath layer in such stands results in low seedling densities and a lack of high frequencies for any species. Maintenance of natural Table Mountain pine stands can be most often ascribed to periodic fire. On very dry sites, the pines may represent an edaphic climax (4,7,8,16,29,31). Other natural agents that lead to regeneration establishment are soil creep, cloudbursts, and forms of windthrow (17). Flowering and Fruiting- Table Mountain pine is monoecious. Cones are commonly seen on trees of sapling size and minimum seed-bearing age is 5 years. In northwestern North Carolina, pollen release at 457 m (1,500 ft) elevation begins the last week of March and ends during the first week of April; at 762 m (2,500 ft), pollen release begins about the second week in April and ceases near the end of the third week. Growth and reproductive activities of Table Mountain pine generally occur as early as, or earlier than, those of associated species (31). Table Mountain pine is reproductively isolated from other pine associates by early pollen release, so hybridization is restricted. The staminate cones of Table Mountain pine are a reddish purple (31). The pollen is very large for eastern pines, being 50.2 ± 4.6 µ in inside diameter. The cone is heavy and egg shaped; the scales are much thicker at the ends and are armed with stout, hooked spines. Young ovulate strobili have a peduncle about 1 cm (0.4 in) long which is visible at maturity; as branch diameter increases, cones appear sessile (32). From two to seven cones are often arranged in whorls on branches, around the stems of saplings, or on leaders (21,25). Cones average 72 mm (2.8 in) in length, ranging from 42 to 103 mm (1.7 to 4.1 in); 54 mm (2.1 in) in width, ranging from 33 to 75 mm (1.3 to 3.0 in); and 64 cm³ (3.9 in³) in volume, ranging from 27 to 134 cm³ (1.6 to 8.2 in³). Cone dimensions and degree of serotiny decrease with increased elevation. Cones are largest at northern latitudes. In general, cones at higher elevations are well developed. Immature cones are deep green to brown, ripe cones are lustrous light brown, and old cones retained on branches are gray. Cones ripen in autumn of the second season; cone opening depends upon the degree of serotiny. Seed Production and Dissemination- The seeds of Table Mountain pine are more or less triangular (32). They average 5.3 mm (0.2 in) long, 3.1 mm (0. 12 in) wide, and 13.8 mg (894 grains) in weight. Wing length varies from 19 to 25 mm (0.7 to 1.0 in) and wings are about 7 mm (0.3 in) wide; they range from a transparent light tan to dark brown. Seed coat roughness varies from smooth to a wart-like surface; the seed coat may be ridged. Cones averaging 58 mm (2.3 in) long and weighing 45 g (1.6 oz) produce about 50 seeds per cone, with an average viability of 81 percent. A bushel of cones contains about 0. 18 kg (0. 4 lb) of seeds. Cleaned seeds average 75,240/kg (34,200/lb) with a range of 67,540 to 83,600/kg (30,700 to 38,000/lb). A temperature range of 16° to 32° C (60° to 90° F) for 30 days is required to extract seed from cones (26); kiln drying expedites the process. Seed weight without coat is about 7.6 mg (0.0003 oz); these large seeds may have adaptive value in drier regions, giving Table Mountain pine an advantage in establishing seedlings (31). Frosts, drought, and heavy rains exert a greater influence on flower initiation, cone growth, seed development, and viability than tree age (21). Although cones shed their seeds very irregularly, large numbers of seeds are disseminated annually. Seedling Development- Table Mountain pine seed kept at 24° C (75° F) for 8 hours daylight and at 5° C (40° F) for 16 hours darkness in sand and peat has shown 65 percent germinative capacity with no pretreatment stratification (26). Germination is epigeal. There can be four to nine cotyledons per seedling (32). At 0.5 and 1.5 years, northern sources have a higher rate of water loss at high soil moisture contents than southern sources. Rate of water loss from seedlings with primary needles is greater than from seedlings with secondary needles (31). Growth of seedlings can be increased by adding calcium and magnesium as soil amendments; other fertilizers have not been tried. Of the three dry-site pines, Table Mountain pine roots are most affected by temperature; it grows a longer root than Virginia pine only between 16° to 28° C (61° to 82° F); pitch pine seedlings have the shortest roots at all temperatures (31). Small top size to root length during seedling establishment would probably be the optimal condition for dry-site survival. Table Mountain pine grows more slowly without mycorrhizae, the root-shoot ratio of non-mycorrhizal seedlings is larger than that of mycorrhizal seedlings. Number of mycorrhizal types was higher in limed than unlimed soil, but liming caused no change in numbers of mycorrhizae (31). Competition from other vascular plants is probably an important factor in determining the distribution of the species, especially during establishment. Table Mountain pine occurs on areas least favorable for rapid plant growth; these harsher sites seemingly limit its early growth less than that of other species, thus allowing it to develop fast enough to compete successfully for canopy space, minerals, and soil moisture. The roots of very young seedlings are longer than that of pitch pine, and 0.5-year-old seedlings have lower transpiration rates (31). Seedlings of Table Mountain pine develop mature needle fascicles earlier than Virginia pine seedlings. Another advantage shown by this species is that seedling height growth and twig and needle elongation occur earlier than in pitch and Virginia pine during the period of least drought stress. The ultimate size of Table Mountain pine on xeric sites is constrained less than that of other tree species, allowing the pine to continue to compete, which it could not do on more fertile sites where hardwoods dominate. Growing conditions associated with poor oak growth characterize Table Mountain pine habitat. Table Mountain pine is regarded as intolerant of shade, even more so than pitch and Virginia pine. The shrub stratum presents greatest competition for seedlings (16), and generally, no seedlings of Table Mountain pine occur on sites without exposed mineral soil. Without fire and anthropic disturbances, Table Mountain pine would probably be found only on extremely dry and sterile rock outcrops and steep shale slopes, where the overstory canopy would be quite open and litter cover would never remain complete (31). Vegetative Reproduction- The prominent epicormic sprouts protruding from the bark of pitch pine are absent in Table Mountain pine; also absent are the dormant buds that occur along the bole and branches of pitch pine-an adaptation which allows recovery from defoliation. Table Mountain pine also has fewer basal buds than pitch pine; basal buds sprout after injury to the stem, allowing recovery of saplings after fire injury and animal damage (31). Table Mountain pine seedlings of natural origin usually have a crook just above or just below ground level which may serve to protect the basal buds against fire.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,13,1
"In an average stand of Table Mountain pine in the Great Smoky Mountains, the species dominates the overstory except that about 8 percent pitch pine is present (16). Within such stands, the canopies are typically discontinuous and are composed of short, small-crowned trees of poor form. A maximum age of 250 years seems reasonable for Table Mountain pine (a counted age of 227 years has been recorded), a maximum diameter of 94.5 cm (37.2 in) and a maximum height of 29 m (95 ft) have been reported (31). The general canopy height in the Great Smoky Mountains ranges from 8 to 12 m (26 to 39 ft), with a majority of canopy stems under 25 cm (9.8 in) d.b.h.; rarely are stems larger than 35 cm (13.8 in). Elsewhere, trees are generally less than 20 m (66 ft) tall and 40 cm (15.7 in) d.b.h. (7,15). Live crowns often average more than 60 percent of total height, and limb-free bole length averages 12 percent (31). Much of the growth of Table Mountain pine goes into branch production. Saplings are abundant, amounting to about 2,000 stems per hectare (809/acre) in the stands, and represent some 14 tree species. As in the canopy, Table Mountain pine saplings compose the majority of saplings. Saplings can vary in form from bushlike when open grown to slender, small-limbed trees in dense stands (16,31). The typical dense heath layer in Table Mountain pine stands severely restricts seedling densities and development and prevents high frequencies for any species. Stands are basically self-maintaining but severe fire is necessary to regenerate them where there is dense heath cover. Stands appearing to be permanent are associated with shallower litter, more rock outcrop, and have less basal area than stands more obviously successional. Mature pitch pines are more resistant to fire damage than Table Mountain and Virginia pines because they have thicker bark. Table Mountain pines are intermediate in fire resistance and bark thickness. The thin-barked Virginia pines are least fire resistant (16,31). Growth and Yield- Stand and stocking values for Table Mountain pine are shown in table 1 by diameter classes. The table shows that trees in the largest d.b.h. classes are in Virginia and North Carolina; this peculiarity of distribution of large trees may be due to differences in the time of stand establishment caused by fire or insect kills. In the southeastern mountains, Virginia has the largest area occupied by Table Mountain pine; the species accounts for 3.4 percent of all trees on the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia (15). Georgia has the least acreage, but average volumes per unit area increase southward from Virginia, with 165.8 m³/ha (2,368 ft³/acre), to Georgia with 282.0 m³/ha (4,028 ft³/acre), probably because of more growing season precipitation, higher temperatures, and longer frost-free periods in stands growing farther south. Because of the large area and volume of Table Mountain pine in Virginia, this State grows and cuts more than other States; the species is virtually nonexistent as a viable timber type in South Carolina mountains and is at a very low volume in Georgia (20). Rooting Habit- Table Mountain pine seedlings are generally anchored into a rock crevice by their taproot (7,15). Secondary or lateral roots then spread through the available soil and litter cover, taking up both moisture and nutrients. Other sinker roots descend into additional crevices, utilizing accumulated soil and the thin skins of finely weathered, nutrient-rich, moist soil-like rock which coat the crevice surfaces. In this way the trees can survive on the most xeric sites. Another adaptation to xeric sites shown by isolated or sparse trees is the production of extremely long branches--even longer than the height of the tree, where the lowermost ones sweep downward, often touching the ground (31). These branches shield the underlying soil, rock, and roots from direct radiation and conserve soil moisture. Under such trees there is more protection against soil creep and the litter cover is relatively stable, with slow decomposition that contributes to available nutrient supplies and permits survival and growth under harshest conditions. Table Mountain and pitch pines are comparable in windfirmness; both surpass Virginia pine in this characteristic (7). Reaction to Competition- An overview of the natural range of Table Mountain pine indicates that it is not reproducing itself well and that regeneration is extremely scattered in patches in openings. Seedlings grow well, forming a dense sapling stand that attains its maximum growth rate at about age 30 when the trees are about 18 cm (7 in) d.b.h., but thereafter growth is exceedingly slow. Most of the present stands range from 60 to 100 years old; some originated after the severe beetle kills of the late 1800's and the fires that followed (4,7,15,16). The keys to successful natural regeneration of Table Mountain pine are heat and light (21). It is classed as intolerant of shade. Even-age management precipitated by clearcutting, or in some cases, a seed-tree cut followed by a hot, fast-moving, prescribed fire to open cones without damaging enclosed seed, should suffice to regenerate it on harsh sites. A severe fire appears necessary for regeneration on sites with a heavy shrub layer (31). It has least competition from associated species on shallow soils, erosion pavements, and rocky areas, and it is on such sites that its management can be most successful. On deeper soils, pitch and Virginia pine should be favored; where considerable microclimatic and soil variation occurs, a mixture of all three species would be best adapted to fully utilizing the site and offering protection against fire and other damaging agents. In remote areas where its perpetuation is desirable, small block or strip cuts on rocky southwesterly exposures with natural seedfall should suffice to regenerate it (7,15,21,31). Damaging Agents- Weather-related factors such as high gusty winds, glaze, heavy wet snowfall, cloudbursts, tornadoes, and lightning have been known to damage stands and isolated trees of Table Mountain pine (7,15,17,31). The most serious diseases of Table Mountain pine are Phaeolus schweinitzii, which causes butt and root rot, and Phellinus pini, which causes heartrot in older or damaged trees (18). Dioryctria yatesi, a cone-boring insect, can in some years destroy entire local seed crops. Periodically, the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, decimates entire stands (3). The European pine sawfly, Neodiprion sertifer, at times defoliates trees of their previous year's needles, but seldom kills the trees. Trees of all sizes, from 3-year-old seedlings to mature specimens, are attacked by the pine twig gall scale, Matsucoccus gallicola, which causes bark to swell and crack, killing foliage and tree.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,14,1
"In Pennsylvania, Table Mountain pine grows on substrates of upper Silurian and lower Devonian rocks. Elsewhere it is known to grow on substrates of the Unicoi, Alligator Back, Loudon, Weverton, Erwin, Pottsville, Chemung, Pocono, Portage, and Hampshire or Catskill Formations (17,31). Table Mountain pine is not found over limestone substrates. Although surface rock varies in Table Mountain pine stands in the Great Smoky Mountains, it is often less than 15 percent of total surface cover; however, on narrow ridges, surface rock can range from 35 to 55 percent or more (16). In about half the stands bedrock occurs less than 50 cm (20 in) below the soil surface. Large amounts of gravel and rocks up to 30 cm (12 in) or more commonly occur in the solum; stone content has been found to range from 24 to 59 percent of air-dry weight (31). Some eleven soil series and rough stony land are associated with Table Mountain pine stands (16,28,31). The most common soil series are Ashe, DeKalb, Ramsey, and Porters. In the Great Smoky Mountains, 57 percent of associated soils are Lithic Dystrochrepts, and 43 percent Typic Dystrochrepts of the order Inceptisols. Generally, A-horizon soils contain an average of 61, 28, and 11 percent sand, silt, and clay, respectively. Most of the B-horizon textures are loams and silt loams; silty clay loam occurs infrequently. Litter depth is about 5 cm (2 in). Organic matter content of the A horizon averages 5.5 percent, and in the B horizon 2.5 percent. Soil pH varies from 4.0 to 4.4 for the A and B horizons, respectively. Water-holding capacity in the solum ranges from 5 to 16 percent. Average nutrient content of a 15-cm (6-in) thick A horizon is as follows: calcium 120 kg/ha (107 lb/acre), magnesium 30 (27), phosphorus 5.8 (5.2), potassium 102 (91), and manganese 40 (36). In the B horizon, nutrient content averages are as follows: calcium 50 kg/ha (45 lb/acre), magnesium 27 (24), phosphorus 7.6 (6.8), potassium 76 (68), and manganese 24 (21). Nitrate and ammonium of the A horizon amount to 2.0 and 19 p/m, respectively; B horizon values are slightly less. Generally, Table Mountain pine stands grow on soils that have minimum profile development and are shallow, stony, strongly acid, excessively drained, infertile, and of low productivity. Table Mountain pine can grow over a wide range in elevation. Known extremes are 46 m (150 ft) in Delaware and 1762 m (5,780 ft) in the Great Smoky Mountains (16,31); most often it occurs between 305 and 1220 m (1,000 to 4,000 ft) above sea level. In the Great Smoky Mountains, elevation affects the distribution of Table Mountain pine and Table Mountain pine-pitch pine stands (8,16,29). Above 1060 m (3,480 ft) Table Mountain pine-pitch pine stands were mostly restricted to south-facing ridges; with increasing elevation, pitch pine decreased in abundance. Dominance of Table Mountain pine stands occurred at elevations above 1300 m (4,270 ft). On typical sites, the southwest-facing aspect is of critical importance to the presence of Table Mountain pine although the species can and does grow on other aspects (16,17,31). Slopes on which it occurs in the Great Smoky Mountains average 42 percent (16). Table Mountain pine has been found growing on an island in the Susquehanna River in southern Pennsylvania where the roots were continuously washed by water. It has also been seen around bogs on Mount Pisgah, NC, and at Big Meadows, Shenandoah National Park, VA (31).",Soils and Topography,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,15,1
"Table Mountain pine is used commercially for pulpwood, low-grade sawtimber, and firewood (7,15). The serotinous cones on many trees make seed available for wildlife on a year-round basis. Many of the short stubby limbs seen on Table Mountain pine are caused by squirrels that prune off the cone-bearing section of the limb to get at seed in the heavily armed cone cluster (22). Also, the heavy heath layer in Table Mountain pine stands provides plentiful wildlife food and cover (16,31). The often gnarly Table Mountain pines are a welcome sight on rocky, cliff-like areas of the Appalachians, but perhaps the most important use of the species is as protection forest; it stabilizes soil, minimizing erosion and runoff from the vast shale barrens and other rugged topographic features within its natural range (17).",Special Uses,Table Mountain Pine,pinus,pungens,conifer,16,1
"Tabonuco dominates a forest association known locally as the tabonuco type (21). In the French West Indies, the association is described as ""forest hygrophytique"" (20), and Beard described it as lower montane rain forest, or Dacryodes-Sloanea (1). These fall within the broader categories of Tropical or Subtropical Wet Forest life zones (7). In Puerto Rico this association averages about 50 tree species per hectare (50/2.5 acres) larger than 10 cm (3.9 in) in d.b.h. In the Luquillo Mountains close associates include motillo (Sloanea berteriana), palma de sierra (Prestoea montana), yagrumo hembra (Cecropia peltata), yagrumo macho (Didymopanax morototoni), and caimitillo verde (Micropholis garcinifolia) (21). The forest type has been described in detail (2,15,21). Characteristics of tabonuco stands include a rich mix of 170 tree species in primary and secondary stands (23) with dominants of Sloanea berteriana, Guarea guidonia, and Manilkara bidentata. The relative density of seedlings to that of canopy trees approximates a ratio of 8 while that of saplings is 0.4 (19). On the average, the stand contains 116 trees per hectare (47/acre) 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) in d.b.h., 100 to 150/ha (40 to 61/acre) larger than 30 cm (11.8 in) in d.b.h., and 63/ha (25/acre) larger than 50 cm (19.7 in) in d.b.h. with a total biomass of 424 t/ha (156 tons/acre) of which 33 percent is in tree boles (14,23). The basal area of the average stand approximates 40 to 46 m² /ha (174 to 200 ft²/acre) and the volume approximates 300 to 345 m³/ha (4,285 to 4,930 ft³/acre) (2). The diurnal gross primary production of a stand with a leaf area index of 6 to 7 in Puerto Rico is reported to average 16 grams of carbon per square meter of ground area (0.052 oz/ft²) (14).",Associated Forest Cover,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,1,0
"Tabonuco in Puerto Rico is found within a mean temperature range of 21° to 25° C (70° to 77° F) and a mean annual precipitation range from 2000 to 4000 mm (79 to 157 in). Precipitation is generally abundant except from February through April, when it may drop to about 75 mm. (3 in) per month. At El Verde, on the northwestern slope of the Sierra de Luquillo at an elevation of 420 m (1,380 ft), well within the tabonuco forest range, data collected over 3 years showed the following: mean temperature, 22.60 C (73° F); mean absolute humidity, 18.7 g/m² (0.02 oz/ft²); mean relative humidity, 91 percent; mean daily insolation, 383 gcal/CM² (383 ly) mean daily pan evaporation, 1.8 mm (0.67 in); mean wind velocity, 4.2 km/h (2.6 mi/h); and mean annual rain",Climate,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,2,0
"Wood cutters in Puerto Rico have recognized two races of tabonuco based on the degree of red color and other visible properties of the wood. Other variations, such as the shape of the fruit, have been observed. The genetic significance of these traits, if any, is unknown. Dacryodes excelsa has a nuclear volume of 52.6 W (9) and shade leaves appear to contain less DNA than sun leaves, 590 compared to 715 Mg/g (3).",Genetics,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,7,0
"Tabonuco is native to elevations from 200 to 900 m (660 to 2,800 ft) throughout Puerto Rico. On favorable sites, it may make up 35 percent of the basal area and 80 percent of the timber volume of the forest, commonly termed Dacryodes-Sloanea association (1). From Puerto Rico, the native range of tabonuco extends into the Lesser Antilles on St. Kitts, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada, a gross forest area of about 2300 km² (888 mi²) (24). Other members of the genus are in South America and Africa (5,8).",Native Range,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Male and female flowers appear on different trees, making this a dioecious species. Flowers are greenish, about 4 mm (0.16 in) across, and develop in lateral, much-branched panicles. The fruit, a one-seeded oblong-ovoid drupe about 19 mm (0.75 in) in diameter, has a corrugated surface when dry (19). The seed is fleshy, with folded cotyledons (5,17). Flowering peaks between May and November, with most fruit falling from October to December. There is some flowering and fruiting at other times and considerable annual variation. Empty fruits commonly fall earlier than those that are fertile. At one period during the autumn of 1963, two-thirds of the crop was composed of empty fruits, although a second smaller crop of viable seeds appeared later. Gamma radiation stress reportedly has led to earlier and increased fruit fall (6). Fruits are generally found in abundance beneath the crowns of the parent trees. Seed Production and Dissemination- Of the fruits that fall, those dark in color were found to be heavier, with 60 fruits per kilogram (27/lb) compared to 73 per kilogram (33/lb), and more viable, up to 22 percent compared to up to 5 percent, than green fruits. Completely developed fruits tend to sink when immersed in water. Of those that float, most are hollow, although as many as 33 percent may still be viable. The period of viability under natural conditions is short but not precisely known. A few seeds are known to have survived 5 weeks storage exposed to the air. Germination is epigeal and takes place within a few days under humid, shady conditions. Under direct exposure to the sun, germination is less than in the shade, 11 percent compared to 28 percent in one test. Seedling Development- In nature the seedlings grow best on steep slopes under low light intensities (0.07 to 0.05 gcal/cm². min or 0.07 to 0.05 ly). They are fragile and root within the litter layer. At an age of 4 months they attain an average height of 16 cm (6.3 in) and typically have six leaves. In some areas there may be as many as four seedlings per square meter (0.4/ft²). Few seedlings grow beyond this stage, only half surviving beyond 8 months. Continued growth of the remaining seedlings under intermediate light intensities is slow. Net photosynthesis is low (60 mg of carbon per m².h or 0.08 gr/ft².h), and the ratio of net photosynthesis to respiration is 0.78 (12). In the nursery it has been found that seedlings during their first month will not withstand direct exposure to the sun. Under shady conditions seedlings attained 22 cm (8.7 in) in 6 months. Like many other large-seeded tree species, tabonuco does not survive bare root transplanting. In contrast, 85 percent survival has been attained by the use of containers with an intact ball of earth about the roots. At 9 years, trees were 3.0 to 4.3 m (10 to 14 ft) in height and 3.8 to 5.0 cm (1.5 to 2.0 in) in d.b.h. (13). Direct sowing in the forest has yielded germination as high as 33 percent but subsequent problems such as leaf fall, drought, and vines precluded successful establishment, so planting is recommended. Vegetative Reproduction- There is no evidence of vegetative reproduction.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Mature tabonucos in Puerto Rico may reach 35 m (115 ft) in total height and 180 cm (71 in) in d.b.h. The age of large trees is estimated at up to 400 years. Unpublished preliminary volume tables exist for the species, and a composite table for tabonuco type forest has been published (2). Because of the mixed nature of the forests in which tabonuco is found, growth and yield of tabonuco per unit of forest area are somewhat meaningless. Diameter growth of individual trees is most rapid on slopes and unexposed ridges and for specimens that are large in size and dominant in crown position (0.15 cm/yr, 0.06 in/yr, for dominant crowns in mature stands vs 0.10 cm/yr, 0.04 in/yr, for suppressed crowns). Growth rates are slow when compared to planted exotics, but what the potential growth of tabonucos would be if planted under comparable conditions is not known. Rooting Habit- The observed preference of tabonuco for upper slopes and ridges and its obvious successful survival of frequent hurricane winds that break crowns rather than uprooting trees point to a strong and presumably deep root system. Root grafts among trees of this species are common and can be seen in stumps that remain alive and continue to develop callus over the cut surface for decades. Anywhere from 10 to 20 individual trees can form a union as a result of root grafts. Dense and deep root-mats develop near the bases of some large trees, presumably where unusually large amounts of litter are trapped on the surface. Reaction to Competition- Overall, tabonuco may be classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. Seedlings are very tolerant. Only a tiny proportion of the seeds that fall produce trees that reach maturity. Competitive factors include light, moisture, mechanical damage resulting from the falling of litter or other trees, and smothering by vines. For best survival, seedlings need to be free of competition until they are at least 3 or 4 m (9.8 to 13 ft) tall. Growth rates of established trees can be accelerated if the trees are released from competition (i.e., from 0.15 cm/yr, 0.06 in/yr, in mature stands to 0.66 cm/yr, 0.26 in/yr, in cutover stands). However, even mature trees will suffer shock if severely exposed to the intensive rays of the sun, due in part to scalding of previously shaded bark. Trees severely isolated in residual stands after logging have been observed to exhibit crown deterioration and will be lost within 10 years. Damaging Agents- The success of tabonuco in the mountains of the West Indies speaks for its capability for dealing with hurricanes. Many trees do not survive, and many of those that do, suffer crown breakage and subsequent heart rot. Despite this, most of the mature trees in Puerto Rico have sound butt logs. A few trees exhibit bark swelling and cankers that provoke an abundance of resin exudation. The pathogen is unknown. Abortion of the fruits is a common and possibly an important phenomenon whose causes are unknown. The significance of fertile seed removal by parrots, other vertebrates, and invertebrates is not known either.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,14,0
"Tabonuco grows on deep, red, acid (pH 4.5 to 5.5), clay soils (Ultisols such as Los Guineos and Humatas) derived from igneous rock. Typically these soils are stony, often with large boulders, and internal drainage is good. Large tabonuco trees tend to be concentrated on upper slopes and ridges, where they may form nearly pure groups whose roots are grafted, thus forming a tree union or clumps of trees. Presumably this reflects the better drainage of soils at such locations or the superior anchorage against hurricane winds that the prominent boulders may offer. Significantly superior diameter growth rates of tabonuco on ridges as compared to swales have been reported (22).",Soils and Topography,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,15,0
"Tabonuco wood is used for all types of furniture, cabinet work, interior trim, general construction, and carpentry. The wood is also useful for crates, boxes, shingles, and small boats. It is a substitute for mahogany in a variety of uses. The wood itself is moderately heavy, with a specific gravity of 0.53 (19). It air-seasons easily and satisfactorily, undergoes moderate and uniform shrinkage during seasoning, and holds its place well after manufacture. Tabonuco is a moderately good machining wood; it cuts and saws easily but will dull saw teeth due to its high silica content. Tabonuco lumber yields good surfaces when planed, sanded, mortised, or shaped (turning and boring are more difficult). It is easily glued, holds nails well, takes stain well, and finishes beautifully with varnish or lacquer. The wood is only slightly resistant to decay, lasting 3 years or less in the ground, and is difficult to impregnate with preservatives by either pressure or nonpressure methods (11,12,18). Tabonuco wood compares favorably with mahogany and birch (24). Early settlers used the resin of tabonuco for making candles and torches, for caulking boats, for incense, and for medicinal purposes. The endangered Puerto Rican parrot feeds on tabonuco seeds.",Special Uses,Tabonuco,dacryodes,excelsa,hardwood,16,0
"Tamarack forms extensive pure stands in the boreal region of Canada and in northern Minnesota. In the rest of its United States range and in the Maritime Provinces tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the forest cover types Tamarack (Society of American Foresters Type 38) and Black Spruce-Tamarack (Type 13) and is a minor component in the following types (11): Black spruce (Picea mariana) is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the boreal region, and northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis), balsam fir, black ash (Fraxinus nigra), and red maple (Acer rubrum) on the better organic-soil (swamp) sites in the northern forest region (11). In Alaska, quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together (50). Additional common associates are American elm (Ulmus americana), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), Kenai birch (B. papyrifera var. kenaica), and yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis). Tamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include dwarf (resin) and low (swamp) birch (Betula glandulosa and B. pumila), willows (Salix spp.), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), and red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera); low shrubs include Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog-rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos) (see 12 for a more complete list). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes sedges (Carex spp.), cottongrass (Eriophorum spp.), false Solomonseal (Smilacina trifolia), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris), and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). Ground cover is usually composed of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) and other mosses (11).",Associated Forest Cover,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,1,1
"Because of its wide distribution, tamarack grows under extremely varied climatic conditions. Average January temperatures range from -30° to -1° C (-22° to 30° F) and those of July from 13° to 24° C (55° to 75° F). The lowest recorded temperatures range from -29° to -62° C (-20° to -79° F); the highest, from 29° to 43° C (85° to 110° F). Annual precipitation within the range of tamarack is also extremely variable. It ranges from 180 mm (7 in) at Fort Yukon, AK, to 1400 mm (55 in) in eastern Canada. Of this, 75 to 355 mm (3 to 14 in) is in June, July, and August. Snowfall has a similarly wide variation, from about 100 cm (40 in) in the District of Mackenzie in northwestern Canada to 510 cm (200 in) near the Atlantic coast in Labrador and Quebec. The average frost-free period for tamarack ranges from probably less than 75 days over much of its range to 120 days in interior Alaska and 180 days along its southern limits. The generally shorter growing season in the northern latitudes is counterbalanced by longer periods of daylight (12).",Climate,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,2,1
"Little information is available on intraspecific hybridization in tamarack, but careful selection and breeding may result in substantial genetic improvement. Similarly, although tamarack has been little used in interspecific hybridization, it has been crossed with two other species of the Section Pauciseriales--Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis) and European larch (L. decidua). Progenies with hybrid vigor are often produced, but seed yield is very low (13). The tamarack-Japanese larch hybrid is especially promising because it combines rapid growth with adaptability to shorter growing seasons (20). Although crosses between tamarack and the remaining species of the Section-Dahurian larch (L. gmelini) and Siberian larch (L. sibirica)- seem feasible (30), apparently none has yet been produced.",Hybrids,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,9,1
"Tamarack has one of the widest ranges of all North American conifers. Its main range extends from Newfoundland and Labrador west along the northern limit of trees, and across the Continental Divide in northern Yukon Territory (52); then south in the Mackenzie River drainage to northeastern British Columbia and central Alberta; and east to southern Manitoba, southern Minnesota, southern Wisconsin, extreme northeastern Illinois, northern Indiana, northern Ohio, northern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, northern Connecticut, and Maine. It also grows locally in the mountains of northern West Virginia and adjacent western Maryland. A major disjunct area of tamarack is found in interior Alaska, in the Yukon and Kuskokwim River basins between the Brooks Range on the north and the Alaska Range on the south; three minor areas are near the Alaska-Yukon border. - The native range of tamarack.",Native Range,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Tamarack is monoecious; male and female flowers are small, solitary, and appear with the needles. Male flowers are yellow, globose, and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old branchlets. Female flowers are reddish, subglobose, and are borne most commonly on 2- to 4-year-old branchlets, but also on branchlets 5 to 10 or more years old, or on 1-year-old twigs of young trees. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Ripe cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and 13 to 19 mm (0.50 to 0.75 in) long. General dates for tamarack flowering in Ontario and the Lake States are April to May (36), especially from late April to early May (1,12). In interior Alaska tamarack generally flowers from mid- to late May (50). General dates for cone ripening in Ontario and the Lake States are August to September. Seed Production and Dissemination- Isolated trees on peatlands and trees in upland plantations begin to bear viable seed at 12 to 15 years of age or even less. In eastern Ontario viable seed has been collected from vigorous plantations as young as 4 years (27). Seed production in large quantities generally begins at about 40 years, the optimum age being about 75 years. Tamaracks on peatland in Saskatchewan and Manitoba do not bear cones in quantity, however, until they are about 50 years old (12). Vigorous, open-grown trees 50 to 150 years old produce the best cone crops; a single tree may bear as many as 20,000 cones containing more than 300,000 full seeds in a good year. Seed production in stands is generally confined to dominant and codominant trees. Open-grown mature stands 80 years old may produce 3,700,000 to 6,200,000 full seeds per hectare (1,500,000 to 2,500,000/acre) in a good year, while closed stands the same age may produce 1,200,000 to 3,000,000 seeds per hectare (500,000 to 1,200,000/acre). Tamarack bears good seed crops at intervals of 3 to 6 years, with some seed produced in intervening years. In Minnesota cones from mature trees averaged 26 seeds, 67 percent of which were full; cones from young trees averaged 39 seeds and 85 percent were full. General dates for tamarack seed dispersal in Ontario, the Lake States, and interior Alaska are September to spring (36,50). A 1-year study in northeastern Minnesota revealed that 65 percent of the crop fell from September 1 to September 20, 25 percent from September 20 to October 10, and nearly all of the remaining 10 percent before October 31. Empty cones remain on the trees from 2 to 5 years (12). Tamarack seeds are 3 mm (0.12 in) long and have light chestnut-brown wings 6 mm (0.25 in) long; cleaned seeds average about 550 000 to 710 000/kg (250,000 to 320,000/lb) (18,36). Although the seeds are small, few fall at a distance greater than twice the tree height. However, tamarack can reproduce well as far as 60 m (200 ft) from seed-bearing trees if favorable seedbeds are present (22). Seedling Development- Up to half the tamarack seeds that fall may be destroyed by rodents. As a result of this loss plus that by fungi or bacteria, only 4 to 5 percent of the seed may germinate (12). In nurseries, erratic and often poor germination has been a major difficulty in producing tamarack stock (27); germination can even be poor in a greenhouse (24). Recleaning the seed can substantially reduce the high percentage of empty or improperly developed seed found in many seed lots (18). Experience in Ontario shows that under optimum conditions, seed collected from vigorous stands in a good seed year has 75 to 90 percent germination (27). Tamarack seed remains viable for 4 years or more when stored in sealed containers at 2 to 5 percent moisture content and -8° to -6° C (18° to 22° F). Internal dormancy apparently ranges from none to mild. Under forest conditions any existing dormancy is broken while the seed lies on the ground during the first winter; thus fall sowing is generally recommended. However, spring-sown seed may germinate well without any cold stratification (18,36). Germination is epigeal, the cotyledons rising above the ground. It normally begins from late May to mid-June and reaches a peak at surface temperatures of 18° to 21° C (65° to 70° F). In laboratory experiments germination has occurred at temperatures as low as 12° C (54° F) (4) and the rate may increase with temperature up to about 24° C (75° F). Under deep shade germination occurred at 13° C (55° F). Alternating day and night temperatures of 30° and 20° C (86° and 68° F), respectively, are recommended for germination tests (36). The best seedbed is warm, moist mineral or organic soil with no brush but a light cover of grass or other herbaceous vegetation. Hummocks of slow-growing sphagnum moss often make a good seedbed, but some sphagnum mosses may offer too much competition. In Minnesota germination beneath tamarack stands was best on fine-textured mosses (primarily Mnium, Drepanocladus, and Helodium) (12). Findings from clearcut peatlands in Minnesota show that slash-burned seedbeds favor tamarack reproduction, whereas slash hinders it (22). On uplands, tamarack apparently reproduces well on rock-raked areas after natural seeding. For best growth tamarack seedlings need abundant light and a constant but suitable water level. In Canadian studies, full light produced the tallest seedlings and heaviest root weights (26). Under drought conditions, leader length and stem diameter were significantly reduced by soil moisture tensions of 15.2 bar (15 atm), but tensions of 1.0 and 6.1 bar (1 and 6 atm) had little effect (14). Seedlings under fully stocked stands usually grow 2 to 3 cm (1 in) the first year and do not survive beyond the sixth year. With little or no cover they may be as tall as 18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 in) the first year and 46 to 64 cm (18 to 25 in) the third year. From then on, growth is generally even more rapid if light is adequate and drainage is good (12). Buds begin to swell 2 or 3 weeks before opening; in northeastern Minnesota this occurs from early to late April. Needles begin to emerge from about mid-April to mid-May in Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and Saskatchewan. On the short shoots, needles elongate rapidly and the annual stem increment- only about 1 mm (0.04 in)- is completed shortly after budbreak. On the long shoots, basal needles reach full length by mid- to late June in northern Wisconsin, whereas stem needles mature along the stem as it grows; stem elongation is completed by the end of July (5). Needles begin to turn yellow in early September in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and reach maximum color in early October in Michigan and northeastern Minnesota. Tamarack loses its needles in these same areas from about mid-September to mid-October (1,12). Height growth apparently does not begin until the first needles are fully developed. In Michigan's Upper Peninsula height growth begins in late May and continues until mid-August (12). Diameter growth begins from early April to early June and ceases from late July to early August in northeastern Minnesota (I). Because they are small, tamarack seedlings are easily killed during the first 6 or 8 weeks after germination. Early losses are primarily caused by damping-off; in the second and third years drought, drowning, and inadequate light sometimes cause appreciable loss. One-year-old seedlings grown in full light can survive desiccation of the upper 2 to 3 cm (1 in) of organic soils to as low as 45 to 65 percent by weight, whereas forest-grown seedlings 1 to 3 years old are fairly intolerant of drought (or flooding) (12). Vegetative Reproduction- Layering is apparently the dominant reproductive mode for tamarack along the northern limit of trees in Canada and Alaska (10,50), whereas farther south it is uncommon but may occur when branches are covered by fast-growing sphagnum moss or drifting sand. Roots are also known to produce shoots (12), and experience in Ontario shows that tamarack can be easily propagated from softwood cuttings taken in early July from young trees (probably less than 5 to 7 years old) (27).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Average height of mature trees is 15 to 23 m (50 to 75 ft), but occasional individuals may grow 30 to 35 m (100 to 115 ft) tall. Mature trees are usually 36 to 51 cm (14 to 20 in) in d.b.h., but a few reach 91 to 102 cm (36 to 40 in). Trees 18 to 24 m (60 to 80 ft) tall and 51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 in) in d.b.h. were once common in the Lake States. In interior Alaska mature tamaracks often are only 3 m (10 ft) tall and 8 cm (3 in) in d.b.h. (12); on good sites, however, they sometimes reach heights of 24 to 27 m (80 to 90 ft) and diameters of 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in) (50). Maximum age is generally 150 to 180 years, but trees 230 to 240 years old and one 335-year-old individual have been found. The growth rate of tamarack apparently depends on both the nutrient status and moisture-aeration conditions of the site. In Minnesota, tamarack site index is positively correlated to nutrient supply and foliar nutrient concentrations (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) but negatively correlated to amount of standing water (43). On water-covered stagnant peatlands, the tree grows slowly and may be only 2 m (6 ft) tall in 55 years. In northern Ontario it grows well on 91 cm. (36 in) or more of peat if the zone of continuous saturation is at a depth of 46 cm (18 in) or more (12); drainage of tamarack-speckled alder swamps in the clay belt would probably increase site index (at 100 years) by about 5 m (16 ft) (39). With abundant light, tamarack is one of the fastest growing conifers on uplands in the boreal (including Alaska) and northern forest regions; on peatlands it outgrows any other native conifer (6,12,50). In Alberta, good-site tamarack averages almost 0.5 m (1.5 ft) in annual height growth for 20 to 30 years, but growth apparently drops sharply when the crowns close, or after the age of 40 to 50 years. Information on growth of natural tamarack stands is apparently available only from northern Minnesota. Limited data indicate that annual growth of poletimber stands (presumably on peatland sites) is from 1.9 to 2.5 m³/ha (0.3 to 0.4 cord/acre). In 70- to 100-year-old stands, annual periodic growth averaged 3.8 m³/ha (0.6 cord/acre) on well-stocked plots with a basal area of 21 m²/ha (93 ft²/acre) and 1.9 m³/ha (0.3 cord/acre) on poorly stocked plots with 8 m²/ha (35 ft²/acre) (12). No yield tables are known for tamarack. Characteristics of a few 80- to 130-year-old stands on medium- to poor-peatland sites in northern Minnesota generally ranged as follows: average height, 12.2 to 15.5 m (40 to 51 ft); average d.b.h., 13.0 to 14.7 cm (5.1 to 5.8 in); number of trees, 1,370 to 1,740/ha (555 to 705/acre); and basal area, 19 to 23 m²/ha (83 to 102 ft²/acre) (41). No doubt because of its potential for rapid juvenile growth, tamarack has been used in several planting tests on different sites in the Lake States (25,32,33) and eastern Canada (15,28). Trees grew slowly on peatland, but on other sites height averaged from 3.2 to 4.4 m (10.5 to 14.4 ft) in 8- to 10-year-old plantations where competing vegetation was initially controlled. Survival was more variable, being very poor on shallow soils over limestone. Growth rate (particularly diameter) declines after 12 to 15 years if tamarack is planted at close spacings such as 1.5 by 1.5 m (5 by 5 ft), but it should be unimpeded for the first 25 years at wider spacings up to 2.4 by 2.4 m (8 by 8 ft). In a good plantation in eastern Ontario, height at 25 years averaged 14.9 m (49 ft), d.b.h. 17.3 cm (6.8 in), and volume 202 m³/ha (32 cords/acre). Depending on site, final harvests of 189 to 252 m³/ha (30 to 40 cords/acre) are possible at 25 years in well-managed tamarack plantations (27). Intensively cultured plantations can produce two to three times more biomass than conventionally tended stands (51). In stands tamarack is characteristically a straight, slender tree with a narrow, pyramidal crown that occupies one-third to one-half the bole length. Trees whose tops have died back after heavy defoliation by the larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii) or after prolonged flooding typically produce numerous adventitious shoots. Although these shoots no doubt help tamarack survive defoliation or flooding, they also apparently support high sawfly populations (12). Rooting Habit- Tamarack typically has a shallow, spreading root system. On favorable sites roots may spread over an area greater in radius than the tree height but are only 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) deep. Trees on sandy upland have a platelike rooting habit; few roots reach below a 30-cm (12-in) depth and taproots are rare. On wet sites tamarack roots are usually stringy with no branches on the terminal 15 cm (6 in). Peatland tamaracks, in particular, have wide root systems and do not form taproots. As the moss layer deepens, new roots develop on the stem above the original root collar, and growth of old roots nearly ceases. On drier sites roots of larger trees bend sharply from the trunks, forming knees (12). Reaction to Competition- Tamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years (21,50), it must become dominant to survive, and when mixed with other species, it must be in the overstory. On good swamp sites in Michigan, for example, tamarack is a dominant tree in the overstory of some mixed conifer stands, but it is practically never found in the understory (2). The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length. Tamarack is a pioneer tree, especially on open unburned bogs and burned organic soil (11). It is generally the first forest tree to invade filled-lake bogs. In the Lake States tamarack may first appear in the sedge mat, sphagnum. moss, or not until the bog shrub stage; farther north it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage (12). Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns (35), so it is one of the usual pioneers on most sites in the boreal forest immediately after fire. The tree commonly forms stands on abandoned farmland in eastern Ontario (27) and reproduces well on sites in Alaska that were cleared and then abandoned (50). Because tamarack is very intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor (bog) sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good (swamp) sites (12). Recurring sawfly outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates (11). Various tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment. A year's delay in planting furrows on a wet lowland resulted in significantly lower first-year survival, apparently because of the rapid resurgence of grass and other herbaceous vegetation (24). On brushy peatland, 7-year survival and height were both much lower where tamarack was planted on unsprayed rather than on herbicide-sprayed areas (33). Six years after broadcast burning and natural seeding on peatland, tamaracks overtopped by surrounding vegetation were only about half as tall as those generally not overtopped (21). Tamarack does not grow well where sugar maple (Acer saccharum) reproduction is present; this seems at least partly due to the maple's root exudate (44). The intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management, with some adaptation of clearcutting or seed-tree cutting generally considered the best silvicultural system, because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually windfirm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and herbicide spraying (22). For successful tamarack plantations, the planting stock's roots and shoots must be well balanced and dormant; probably the best stock is begun in a greenhouse and transplanted for 1 year. Competition must also be controlled, the first 2 years after planting being critical. Because tamarack is very intolerant, the trees should be planted at wide spacings such as 2.4 by 2.4 m (8 by 8 ft) (27). Damaging Agents- Because its bark is thin, tamarack is highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands; and because its roots are shallow, it is usually killed on peatlands by all but very light burns. However, the habitat of tamarack-especially south of the boreal forest-is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire (6). In the boreal forest the tamarack type apparently has a high surface-fire hazard in spring but a low crown-fire hazard in pure stands (35). Abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands, and those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots (8). Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding. Road-caused flooding has killed tamarack or reduced its growth on thousands of hectares in northern Minnesota (40); natural gas and petroleum pipelines will probably have similar effects unless cross drainage is provided (3). Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet sites where rooting is shallow. Compared with black spruce, however, tamarack seems to be fairly windfirm. The larch sawfly is the most destructive insect enemy of tamarack. Epidemics occur periodically across Canada and the northern United States and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak and trees die after 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation (9). In southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota, however, imported parasites of the sawfly (especially Olesicampe benefactor) have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks (42). The larch casebearer (Coleophora laricella) is also a serious defoliator of tamarack. A native of Europe, it is now widely distributed in eastern North America westward to southeastern Manitoba and the Lake States. The larch casebearer attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas (49). Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably because imported parasites of the casebearer have also become widely established (34). Only a few other insects and related organisms (such as mites) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) can severely damage tamarack where it grows along with balsam fir and white spruce-the preferred hosts. The larch bud moth (Zeiraphera improbana) has had occasional short epidemics, and the spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis) is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The larch shoot moth (Argyresthia laricella) is widely distributed but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the eastern larch beetle (Dendroctonus simplex), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees. Warren's collar weevil (Hylobius warreni), common in Canada, has killed pole-sized tamarack in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (34,49). Several insects feed on tamarack cones and seeds, but little is known about their importance. Those that feed inside cones include the spruce coneworm (Dioryctria reniculelloides) and a seed chalcid (Megastigmus laricis). Two defoliators that sometimes feed on tender young cones during epidemics are the spruce budworm and the larch bud moth (16,34). Cones were still being produced after 3 to 4 years' defoliation by the larch sawfly in Canada and after 8 years of attack in northern Minnesota (12). Tamarack is host to many pathogens, but none causes disease serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture. The only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust of poplar (Populus spp.) and larch (Larix spp.) in eastern and central North America. However, this rust, caused by the fungus Melampsora medusae, and other rusts do little damage to tamarack (19,37). The needle-cast fungus Hypodermella laricis has attacked tamarack in Ontario and has the potential for local damage. Tamarack is essentially free of stem diseases. Eastern dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) is occasionally found on the tree (29), but its witches' brooms are small on tamarack and occur only where the tree is growing in mixture with infected black spruce (19). The root- and butt-rot fungi reported on tamarack include Armillaria (or shoestring) root rot (Armillaria mellea), Scytinostroma galactinum, red-brown butt rot (Phaeolus schweinitzii), and the false velvet top fungus (Inonotus tomentosus) (19,47). They are not aggressive killers on tamarack; however, flood-damaged trees are particularly susceptible to attack by fungi such as Armillaria root rot (8), and pole-sized trees have been killed by the false velvet top fungus. The principal heart-rot fungi of tamarack are brown trunk rot (Fomitopsis officinalis) and red ring rot (Phellinus pini). Climacocystis borealis causes a white mottled rot of tamarack in Canada (19). Snowshoe hares kill many tamarack seedlings in some areas of the Lake States, Alberta, and Alaska (50). White-tailed deer and moose apparently browse seedlings or saplings to a lesser extent. Porcupines commonly feed on the inner bark and deform the stem or kill the tree. Many tamarack stands have been damaged by this pest in the Lake States, Maine, and eastern Canada (27). It can be especially damaging in plantations (48). Red squirrels often cut cone-bearing branchlets, and birds such as the red crossbill occasionally eat the seeds (12).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,14,1
"Tamarack can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grows most commonly on wet to moist organic soils (Histosols) such as sphagnum peat and woody peat. The latter is usually better decomposed, has more nitrogen and mineral nutrients, and is less acid than sphagnum peat. Tamarack grows fairly well on extremely dry soils where these are shallow over bedrock or where the water table is low, but it can die from drought on such sites. The tree is found on mineral soils, especially Inceptisols and Entisols, that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on calcareous soils, it is not abundant on the limestone areas of eastern Ontario (27) and is rare on those of the Gaspé Peninsula and Anticosti Island in Canada. Because it can withstand high soil moisture, high acidity, and low soil temperature, tamarack is more abundant on peatlands than trees characteristic of surrounding uplands. It grows best, however, on more favorable sites such as moist but well-drained loamy soils along streams, lakes, and swamps; seep areas; and mineral soils with a shallow surface layer of organic matter (12). In Alaska tamarack grows well on upland sites having wind-deposited loess soils (50). Tamarack is a characteristic tree of peatlands, especially in the southern limits of its range. It is found on the full range of peatlands from rich swamp (forested rich fen) to raised bog but is most characteristic of poor swamps where the soil water is weakly enriched with mineral nutrients (17). Farther north tamarack is still common on peatlands (38); in Alaska it occurs especially on bogs underlain by permafrost (perennially frozen soils) (50). Tamarack often grows on much drier sites in the northern part of its range. Scattered individuals and sometimes stands are found on swamp margins, on the banks of streams and lakes, and on low ridges and benches and other upland sites. In the Hudson Bay lowlands, tamarack grows on both extensive fens (11) and beach ridges (38). In British Columbia it is often an upland tree, growing on the cool moist north slopes of mountains as well as in valley swamps. Tamarack grows on sites with about the same elevation throughout most of its range. In eastern North America, however, the tree grows between sea level and 1220 m (4,000 ft); in the Canadian Rockies and Alaska it grows between about 180 and 520 m (600 and 1,700 ft) (12).",Soils and Topography,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,15,1
"The principal commercial use of tamarack in the United States is for making pulp products, especially the transparent paper in window envelopes. Because of its rot resistance, tamarack is also used for posts, poles, mine timbers, and railroad ties. Other wood products include rough lumber, fuelwood, boxes, crates, and pails (23). In interior Alaska young tamarack stems are used for dogsled runners, boat ribs, and fishtraps (4); in northern Alberta the branches are used to make duck and goose decoys (50). Historically, knees from larger trees were used in wooden ship construction and Indians used the fine roots to sew birch bark, the wood for arrow shafts, and the bark for medicine (48). Tamarack has certain wildlife values. Porcupines feed on the inner bark, snowshoe hares browse on seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds. Birds common in tamarack stands during the summer include the white-throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellowthroat, and Nashville warbler (7). The American osprey, a sensitive species, often nests in lowland types such as tamarack; and the great gray owl, a rare winter visitor in the northern Lake States, apparently nests there only in the tamarack peatlands of northern Minnesota. Tamarack is esthetically appealing, especially in early autumn when its needles turn yellow. Although the tree has been infrequently planted for ornamental purposes (30), it has significant potential-even in Alaska (50)- because of its rapid growth and fall color. Tamarack is particularly valuable in suburban areas but is not suitable as a shade tree on city streets (18). Tamarack has limited value as a watershed protector because it usually grows on gently sloping terrain, and management of the type probably has little or no effect on water yield or quality because harvesting is generally on a small scale.",Special Uses,Tamarack,larix,laricina,conifer,16,1
"Tanoak grows within the life zones classified as the Canadian and Transition. It is the most abundant hardwood species in timber stands of the Coast Ranges of California (6) and southwestern Oregon. Tanoak is a common component in the following forest cover types (4): Redwood (Society of American Foresters Type 232), Pacific Ponderosa Pine (Type 245), Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-Fir (Type 244), Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243), and California Coast Live Oak (Type 255). It is a particularly important component of Pacific Douglas-Fir (Type 229) and Douglas-Fir-Tanoak-Pacific Madrone (Type 234). The principal body of tanoak is a broad band along the inland side of the redwood belt. Here tanoak sometimes forms almost pure stands (6). More often it is an understory tree with Douglas-fir or is a component of hardwood stands or mixed hardwood-conifer forests. The most common hardwood associated with tanoak is Pacific madrone. Other frequent hardwood associates include giant chinkapin (Castanopsis chrysophylla), canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis), California black oak Q.kelloggii), and California-laurel (Umbellularia californica). Tanoak is found most often with Douglas-fir and redwood. Other common conifer associates are California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa var. ponderosa), California torreya (nutmeg) (Torreya californica), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophyl1a). A large variety of shrubs, forbs, grasses, sedges, and ferns are also associated with tanoak. Generally these plants are not abundant on forested land, but, with tanoak sprouts, often become aggressive on burned or cutover areas. Among the most common shrubs are blueblossom (Ceanothus thyrsiflorus), California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica), salal (Gaultheria shallon), Pacific bayberry (Myrica californica), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum), thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), western poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and California huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum). Two smaller plants producing woody growth above ground are prince's-pine (Chimaphila umbellata var. occidentalis) and Oregon grape (Berberis nervosa). Many forbs and grasses are plentiful in the tanoak range. Among the most important forbs are bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), New Zealand fireweed (Erechtites arguta), Australian fireweed (E. minima), and western whipplea (Whipplea modesta). Common grass species include California brome (Bromus carinatus), soft chess (B. mollis), California fescue (Festuca californica), and California sweetgrass (Hierochloe occidentalis). Western swordfern (Polystichum munitum) and western bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens) sometimes grow abundantly with tanoak. Sedges (Carex spp.) also are represented in some places.",Associated Forest Cover,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,1,0
"Tanoak grows in a climate broadly classified as humid. Annual precipitation, however, is seasonal and varies from 1020 to 2540 min (40 to 100 in). Some precipitation is snow. Summer and early fall are dry and the winter rainy. From June through September rainfall totals less than 25 min (1 in) a month. In fact, precipitation during these months amounts to only 5 percent of the year's total. Most of the precipitation-about 70 percent-falls between November and February. Average mean daily temperatures range from 2° to 6° C (36° to 42° F) during January and 16° to 23° C (60° to 74° F) in July. The season free of killing frosts begins between March 8 and April 30 and ends between October 20 and November 20, varying in length between 160 and 249 days. Over a 30-year period the maximum temperature recorded at 183 in (600 ft) elevation in the center of tanoak's area of maximum development was 45° C (113° F).",Climate,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,2,0
"No hybrids of tanoak are known. Although Lithocarpus comprises between 100 and 200 species, all but tanoak are native to southeastern Asia and Indomalaysia (11).",Hybrids,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,9,0
"A shrubby variety of tanoak (L. densiflora var. echinoides) grows near Mount Shasta, on the west slope of the northern Sierra Nevada, in the central Trinity Alps, in the Salmon and Klamath Mountains, and northward through the Siskiyou Mountains into southern Oregon (28). The shrub variety occupies a narrow elevational band just above that inhabited by the tree form. This variety is found on a wide range of soils including ultrabasics, but generally occurs only on moist sites (27). On deep, productive soils, especially in the Sierra Nevada, it forms a dense cover of large clumps that often become flattened by snow. Stems from such clumps may straggle downslope for 5 m (16 ft) or more. After cutting or burning, upright sprout clumps are formed that closely resemble those of root crown sprouts from tanoak trees in clearcuttings (17). Small woody plants with slender, deeply toothed leaves were discovered in 1962 on the Challenge Experimental Forest, Yuba County, CA. These plants are believed to be a sublethal recessive mutation of tanoak and have been named Lithocarpus densiflora f. attenuato-dentatus (33).",Hybrids,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,9,0
"A disjunct stand slightly north of the Umpqua River in southwestern Oregon has been reported as the northernmost limit of tanoak's natural range. The general northern limit of tanoak in the Coast Ranges, however, is farther south in the Coquille River drainage. Its eastern limit in Oregon extends from west of Roseburg to Grants Pass, and then southwesterly into the Applegate River drainage. Tanoak's range stretches southward through the Coast Ranges in California to the Santa Ynez Mountains north and east of Santa Barbara, CA. The range also extends northeastward from the Humboldt Bay region to the lower slopes of Mount Shasta, then intermittently southward along the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada as far as Mariposa County (7). In the Sierra Nevada, tanoak is most common between the Feather and American Rivers. -The native range of tanoak.",Native Range,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Staminate catkins are elongate and erect, 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long. Blossoms may appear in the spring, summer, or autumn. However, most tanoaks bloom in June, July, or August. Trees at lower elevations and near the coast bloom earlier than trees at higher elevations and farther inland. The plant is monoecious. Almost all the flowers, both male and female, are borne on new shoots (22), where they grow from the axils of the new leaves. Flowers also occasionally develop from buds found at the base of leaves of the previous year's growth. Female flowers are borne at the base of erect male catkins. The profusion of yellowish blossoms that sometimes conceal the foliage suggested the tree's specific scientific name. The calyx is pale green; the stamen filament is white; and the anther yellow. The seeds, which are similar to oak acorns, ripen in the second autumn. Seeds are usually borne singly, in twos, or in threes (25), but sometimes more are clustered together. Seed Production and Dissemination- Tanoak is a heavy seeder (3). In general, viable seeds are borne in abundance after the 30th to 40th year (8), although 5-year-old sprouts also have produced fairly heavy crops. A long dry period at pollination time helps the setting of acorns. Trees are heavily laden almost every alternate year, and complete seed crop failures are rare. ""Jayhawking""-peeling the bark from standing trees-has shown that girdling produces excessively large acorn crops before the trees die. Scanty crops generally are caused by frosts or by a dry year. Mature trees produce the most acorns. One estimate places annual acorn production of a veteran tanoak 76 cm (30 in) in d.b.h. at about 454 kg (1,000 lb). Because about 110 acorns weigh 0.45 kg (I lb), this production is more than 110,000 acorns. Other estimates showed that trees between 46 and 61 cm (18 and 24 in) d.b.h. produced 3,900 to 4,600 acorns. Insects destroy a significant number of acorns. One study found insect larvae infesting 51 percent of the acorns. The insects identified were the filbert weevil (Curculio uniformis) and the filbertworm. (Melissopus latiferreanus). Other insect larvae that have been found in tanoak acorns are from the families Gelechiidae and Pyralidae (5). Many immature acorns have been seen on the ground as early as August 25, but these were probably knocked down by heavy rains. Mature tanoak acorns drop between September 20 and November 15. The first acorns to fall are usually insect infested, whereas those falling later are usually sound. Indians in California placed a taboo on collecting acorns for food until their medicine women held a ceremonial festival that celebrated the falling of sound acorns. Because the acorns are large-2.5 to 5.1 cm (1.0 to 2.0 in) long and 15 to 18 min (0.6 to 0.7 in) in diameter-and heavy, most of them fall straight to the ground and are found under the tree crowns. Only a few bounce outward when dropping onto lower branches or roll for short distances on steep slopes. In one small study, acorns were counted under trees 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) in diameter at ,rates of 194,000 to 226,000/ha (78,400 to 91,500/acre) (24). Seedling Development- With suitable conditions, tanoak reproduces well from seed. Acorns germinate in a wide range of environments from oldgrowth stands to recent clearcuts (31). However, survival of unprotected seed is low in clearcuts due to heavy predation. The dense shade of virgin forests, and the thick litter found under tanoaks, madrones, or other hardwoods, do not hinder germination. Seedlings are common in these conditions. Tanoak germination is hypogeous. A limited number of tests show that germination rates vary from 19 to 80 percent (25). When acorns were planted with pointed end up, germination was significantly greater (13). Almost all natural seedlings emerge in the spring; some germination may occur in the fall, but only if the weather is mild and moist. To preserve their viability, tanoak acorns must either be planted immediately in the nursery in light soil, or be stratified until spring at temperatures just above freezing. Seedlings appear about 3 weeks after planting. Natural tanoak seedlings have been counted under parent trees left after the Douglas-fir overstory had been cut. Although 1 year's acorn crop produced 395 to 940 seedlings per hectare (160 to 380 seedlings/acre) under trees 51 to 66 cm (20 to 26 in) d.b.h., the efficiency of sound acorns in producing seedlings was only 0.64 percent. Only one seedling grew from 156 sound acorns. Many natural seedlings are found in the understory of conifer stands, which appears to be an ideal environment for reproduction (29). In southwestern Oregon, seedling survival after 4 years ranged from 44 to 49 percent in conifer stands whose ages ranged from 50 to 100+ years (31). In the northern Sierra Nevada, from 17 to 347 new seedlings per acre were present annually during an 11-year period (13). The annual appearance of new seedlings along with modest rates of mortality resulted in relatively stable populations of 570 to 3000/ha (233 to 1,215/acre) during these 11 years. However, attempts to establish a plantation of tanoak by artificial seeding on an exposed site, which had been prepared by removing vegetation and exposing mineral soil, were unsuccessful (13). Biotic factors contribute to low seed crop efficiency. Although the acorns have hard seedcoats-the generic name, Lithocarpus, from the Greek ""lithos"" meaning rock, and ""karpos"" meaning fruit, alludes to the hard acorn-at least 38 species of animals eat them (2). Principal consumers include 4 bird species, 11 rodent species, deer, bears, and raccoons. Goats, hogs, and cattle also prevent seedling reproduction by devouring acorns and browsing tender seedlings. Heights of first-year, natural tanoak seedlings, measured from cotyledons to growing tip, in one study varied from 5 to 21 cm (1.9 to 8.3 in) and averaged 13 cm (5.2 in), greater than first-year heights of natural conifers on the same site (24). After the first year, the seedling growth rate is moderate, less than 5.0 cm (2 in) per year. Tanoak seedlings begin to produce burls below ground at 1 to 2 years of age. Burls develop more quickly on good sites and, in one study, averaged 25 mm (1.0 in) in diameter in 10 to 12 years (29). After 6 to 12 years, the original stem dies (even without browsing or other damage) and a new top is produced that tends to be more vigorous than the original one. Tanoak seedlings thus become seedling-sprouts. Top replacement is common, and seedling-sprouts may support several live stems (29). The tallest stem ranged from 25 to 150 cm (10 to 60 in) on 20-year-old seedling- sprouts in southwestern Oregon interior sites. More rapid development is likely in the coast range and northern Sierra Nevada forests. Tanoak seedling-sprout ages can be estimated by counting xylem rings in the stem below the burl, but there is no reliable relation between top age and/or size and total seedling-sprout age (29). The growth potential of seedling-sprouts is low. Forty- to fifty-year-old tanoak seedling-sprouts, for example, had burls that were only 5.0 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 in) in diameter. Three years after removal of the overstory by cutting and burning, they produced clumps of 4 to 6 stems that averaged only 51 cm (20 in) tall. Records on the seasonal growth of tanoak are scanty. Some observations have been recorded in the vicinity of Salyer, CA. Here, in the Trinity River valley and on the low mountain slopes up to 610 m (2,000 ft) elevation, tanoak vegetative buds open in mid-April. From 610 to 1065 m (2,000 to 3,500 ft), buds burst in mid-May, and from 1065 to 1340 m (3,500 to 4,400 ft), foliage growth begins in late May. At its elevational. limit near Salyer, which is about 1370 m (4,500 ft), buds open in early June. Leaves persist for 3 to 4 years (24). The growing season lasts 4 to 5 months in the mountains and somewhat longer at lower elevations and nearer the coast. Vegetative Reproduction- Tanoak reproduces prolifically by vigorous sprouts that appear at practically any time under a wide variety of conditions (3). Sprouts may start to grow after a relatively minor basal injury, after bark has been stripped from the trees for tannin extraction, or when the aerial parts of the tree are destroyed by fire or logging (22). Even healthy trees sometimes sprout. Sprouts develop from conical woody buds that lie under the bark at the base of the tree. Most of these buds are found on burls below the groundline. Because the number of buds varies from few to thousands, the number of sprouts also varies. As many as 1,400 have been counted on one large stump. The only mechanical damage that prevents sprouting is stripping the bark below the ground level to expose the buds. Sprouts from burls grow rapidly in a wide range of environments. In clearcuts, they have reached 1.7 m (5.6 ft) the first year and 4.1 m (13.6 ft) after 5 years. The microclimate within sprout clumps is quite different from the microclimate immediately adjoining them (21). Sprout growth is reduced somewhat by a conifer overstory (13). The size of parent trees between 3 and 43 cm (1.3 and 16.8 in) in d.b.h. determined the height and diameter growth of sprout clumps, and the number of sprouts in a clump. The larger parent trees produced greater sprout development. Sprouts are reduced drastically in numbers early in their life and growth is concentrated on the dominant stems. In the first 15 or 20 years, sprouts grow an average of about 0.6 m (2 ft) in height a year. Often, a circle of four to eight slender 30-year-old poles grows around the stump of a parent tree. These poles may average 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in) in d.b.h. (24). Thinning all but 2 to 4 sprouts per clump of 3 to 10-year-old sprout clumps did not increase height or diameter growth of the remaining sprouts, largely because rapidly growing new sprouts quickly replaced those that had been cut (14). Leaf area, total above-ground biomass, height, clump width and area, and number of stems 1 to 6 years after cutting were statistically correlated with parent tree diameter at 1.4 in (4.5 ft) before cutting or burning (9). Thus, sprout clump size and total stand cover can be predicted from stand stocking tables before harvesting or burning either conifer stands with a tanoak understory or pure tanoak stands (30). Although not growing as fast as sprouts of some associated hardwoods, such as bigleaf maple and madrone, tanoak sprouts are significant competitors because they are usually abundant, especially in conifer stands. Tanoak sprouts often quickly dominate the vegetational cover after logging or fire. Although this ability helps reduce soil erosion, tanoak sprouts often provide severe competition to conifer reproduction and may suppress it. The thick, stiff, flat, leathery leaves often cover young conifer seedlings or cover the ground so thoroughly that conifer seedlings cannot emerge above them (20). Propagation of tanoak by grafts or cuttings has not been reported. Tanoak sprouts can be controlled by herbicides applied to frills on the stems, to stumps of freshly cut stems, or to foliage of young sprout clumps (32).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The form of tanoak varies greatly. In closed stands, particularly in dense coniferous forests, tanoaks develop one central axis, narrow crowns, ascending branches, and long trunks that are clear for 9.1 to 24.4 in (30 to 80 ft). In this form, tanoak is one of the most stately broadleaved trees in the West. In open stands, however, especially in association with Pacific madrone and California black oak, tanoaks are free branching, the crowns are broad, the limbs horizontal and large, and the trunks short and thick. The main trunk divides into several large branches and forms a rounded crown. Tanoak is usually classed as medium in size (15). Mature trees are generally 15.2 to 27.4 in (50 to 90 ft) tall but frequently grow to 45.7 in (150 ft) (26). The tallest tree reported was 63.4 in (208 ft) high and 137 cm (54 in) in d.b.h. It was found on the North Fork of the Little Sur River, Monterey County, CA. Mature trees vary from 15 to 122 cm (6 to 48 in) in d.b.h. The largest diameter of record is 277 cm (109 in), measured on a tanoak near Kneeland, Humboldt County, CA. This tree was 30.5 in (100 ft) tall and the crown had a spread of 23.2 in (76 ft) (1). Tanoaks with the largest diameters generally grow in open stands where tree heights are lower. Age-height-diameter relationships in Sonoma County, CA, were as follows (24): The growth of tanoak has been called slow, moderate, and fairly rapid. Knowledge about growth rate is limited, for only a few trees have been measured. Seven trees near Sherwood, Mendocino County, CA, which varied from 36 to 69 cm (14 to 27 in) in diameter at 0.61 in (2 ft) above the ground, had from 4 to 8 rings per centimeter (10 to 20/in). At another location, trees 48 years old averaged 25 cm (10 in) in d.b.h. and 10.7 in (35 ft) tall. Trees 36 to 46 cm (14 to 18 in) in d.b.h. were from 80 to 128 years old, and trees 51 to 152 cm (20 to 60 in) were from 150 to 250 years old. It is difficult to ascertain the age of tanoak. As noted earlier, seedling sprouts in the understory were 50 to 60 years of age and less than 2 in (6 ft) tall. A tanoak taller than 20 in (60+ ft) had five stems ranging in size from 10 to 35 cm (4 to 12 in) d.b.h. and in age from 29 to 94 years (29). It also had four burls below ground 35 to 90 cm (1.5 to 2.5 ft) d.b.h. in diameter, with scars of large stems 50 cm (1.5+ ft) which had died, broken off, and decayed. This tree was likely older than the 240-year-old conifers in the overstory. When the overstory is removed, sprouting tanoak forms an even-aged stand above ground, regardless of actual age. Growth of tanoak stands 50 to 60 years old above ground thinned to six different basal-area densities (19 to 32 m²/ha; 85 to 141 ft²/acre) grew about 6 m³/ha/yr (85 ft³/acre/yr) for 8 years after thinning (16). Rooting Habit- Tanoaks develop deep taproots (22) and also develop intricate systems of lateral roots which may approach the soil surface and grow downhill, eventually emerging from the soil where they form burls that produce sprouts. The sapwood of tanoak is extremely thick, reaching a high of 66 percent even on large trees. This condition helps trees to live after the bark has been stripped for tannin production or after trees have been girdled for eradication. Some girdled trees have lived as long as 30 years. Reaction to Competition- Tanoak generally is classed as tolerant of shade (22). It is aggressive and well fitted by its reproductive habits, vigor, and shade endurance to compete for possession of the ground (31). Although tanoak can endure considerable shade throughout life, it grows best with top light. In conifer stands where it has an equal opportunity to grow, it can compete with redwood and Douglas-fir (23). In dense stands, natural pruning produces long clear boles. Tanoak can reproduce from both seed and sprouts and thus maintain itself in a wide range of forest types and successional stages. Under dense conifer stands it is often abundant (610 to 5300 stems/per hectare; 240 to 2,100/acre) (29), and continuous input of new seedlings can maintain or increase stocking (13). After the overstory is logged or burned, even small tanoaks can respond, and tanoaks of all sizes may dominate disturbed areas. Because of its ability to respond to disturbance and to reproduce and grow in the shade, it is considered to be a climax species in Douglas-fir, redwood, and mixed-conifer forests. Damaging Agents- Fire is the principal enemy of individual tanoak trees (3). Ground fires, as well as crown fires, are sometimes fatal. More often, however, fires leave long vertical wounds reaching from 1.2 to 3.0 in (4 to 10 ft) up the trunks. Although the bark of mature trees is at least 3 to 8 cm (I to 3 in), and occasionally 10 or 13 cm (4 or 5 in) thick, some trees are burned badly. Fire injuries to small trees often heal over, but fungi usually enter the wounds on older trees. The exposed wood on these larger trees rots and the wounds do not heal. If decayed wood catches fire it burns readily and the original wound is enlarged. Sometimes one-third to one-half the diameter of the tree is destroyed as a result of repeated fires and decay. Until injured by fire, tanoak is relatively free from insect attacks and fungal diseases and is windfirm (3). Injury to the trunk, however, allows fungi to enter. Wind and heavy snows eventually fell many trees originally injured by fire and subsequently weakened by decay. Fire and fungi cause tanoak to be fairly defective. One study based upon cubic volume in 90 trees showed that the amounts of saw log cull were 39 percent in cull trees, 8 percent in noncull trees, and 13 percent in all trees. Fungi found in living trees are the beefsteak fungus (Fistulina hepatica), which causes a brown cubical rot; the weeping conk (Inonotus dryadeus), a white root rot; and a necrophyte (Schizophyllum commune), which causes a sap rot on injured areas of standing trees. Tanoak is susceptible to the shoestring root disease (Armillaria mellea). The fungus Ceuthocarpum conflictum causes a commonly seen leafspot on tanoak (10). Several insects have been found feeding on tanoak but, generally, the damage is not economically significant. Two of these are armored scales identified as the greedy scale (Hemiberlesia rapax) and the oak scale (Quernaspis quercus). The greedy scale chiefly infests the bark but also feeds on leaves. The oak scale feeds on the undersides of leaves. Another insect, the crown whitefly (Aleuroplatus coronatus), resembles soft unarmored scales and feeds on the undersides of leaves, sometimes causing the leaves to fall prematurely. Ehrhorn's oak scale (Mycetococcus ehrhorni) is found on stems and the white sage mealybug (Pseudococcus crawi) on stems and leaves (5). In 1957, the California oakworm (Phryganidia californica) completely destroyed that year's foliage of tanoaks growing on Hennessey Ridge, near Salyer, Trinity County, CA. This damage was localized and was not observed at other places nearby. Usually, the California oakworm causes little damage but irregularly becomes epidemic over large areas. Other insects work under the bark. Adults of the Pacific oak twig girdler, Agrilus angelicus, feed on foliage, but its larvae mine spiral galleries that girdle twigs, small limbs and trunks, or sprouts. Adults of a false powderpost beetle (Mela1gus confertus) prune twigs by boring at the fork of small branches (5). Decline of tanoak sprout vigor was observed in mixed conifer-hardwood forests in the central Sierra Nevada (18). Affected clumps were wider and denser, but only one-fifth as tall as unaffected clumps. Reason for the decline is not known. Tanoak is avoided by livestock if better feed is available. Mule deer rarely browse it. The current year's growth of tanoak leaves and twigs is protected by abundant stellate trichomes, which are unpleasant to inhale.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,14,0
"Tanoak grows well on a variety of soils developed from igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks, or sedimentary rock alluvium. It grows best on soils that are deep, well-drained, and loamy, sandy, or gravelly. Tanoak also grows on soils derived from serpentine, which are intermediate between the moist and dry extremes, but is limited to a shrubby form. It is seldom found on heavy clayey soils. High-site soils for redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) or Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), such as the Hugo, Sheetiron, Josephine, Empire, Larabee, Sites, and Melbourne (12) series, are also well suited for the growth of tanoak (28). These soils have been derived from either consolidated or soft sedimentary rocks. They are light grayish brown or light reddish brown to brown in color and are moderately to strongly acidic. Soil textures grade through gravelly loam, sand loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, to clay loam. Soil orders are mostly Inceptisols and Alfisols. Besides growing well on deep soils, tanoak also thrives on stony and shallow soils that are less suitable for conifers. Yet tanoak requires more moisture than many other hardwoods. It will grow well on the shallow and stony soils of north slopes, for example, but will be supplanted by Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), Oregon white oak Quercus garryana), or California black oak (Q. kelloggii) on the warmer, drier south slopes. Throughout the Coast Ranges from the northern limit of tanoak's distribution (lat. 43° 42° N.) to the Santa Lucia Mountains (lat. 35° 40°N.) tanoak grows from sea level to elevations of 1220 or 1525 in (4,000 or 5,000 ft). The terrain is rough, steep, and extremely dissected by both major streams and smaller drainages. In the Santa Ynez Mountains, at the southern limit of its range (lat. 34° 34° N.), tanoak grows at 730 to 1435 in (2,400 to 4,700 ft). In the northern Sierra Nevada, it grows between elevations of 580 and 1220 in (1,900 and 4,000 ft) and in the central Sierra Nevada between 915 and 1525 m (3,000 and 5,000 ft). At its southern limit in the Sierra Nevada, tanoak is found between 1525 to 1980 in (5,000 and 6,500 ft) near Signal Peak (lat. 37° 32° N.) in the Sierra National Forest (24). Tanoak is most abundant and, in general, attains its largest sizes in Humboldt and Mendocino Counties, CA, between elevations of 150 to 915 in (500 to 3,000 ft) on northerly and easterly slopes and toward the summits of the seaward exposures of the Coast Ranges. In the southern Coast Ranges, tanoak is common in the Santa Cruz and Santa Lucia Mountains, particularly on the westerly slopes. And in the central Sierra Nevada, where the climate is less humid, it grows in valleys, coves, ravines, along streams, and on north slopes.",Soils and Topography,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,15,0
"The Indians in California's North Coast Range obtained one of their principal foods from tanoak. In fact, the main fare of many Indian communities was salmon and tanoak acorns. The large acorns were ground, leached, and then prepared as a soup, cooked mush, or a kind of bread. After being leached, the acorns are said to have an agreeable acid taste. They also contain a comparatively large amount of oil. On this account, tanoak acorns were preferred by local Indians over all other kinds. Ground tanoak acorns have also been fed to chickens. Tannin from tanoak bark has properties intermediate between chestnut tannin and the usual oak tannin of commerce. The extract from tanoak bark, however, furnishes the best tannage known for the production of heavy leathers. For example, it gives excellent plumping when used to tan sole or saddle leather. The superiority of tanoak bark extract is attributed to the presence of certain other acids, such as gallic and acetic, with the tannic acid. Tanoak tannin has also been used medicinally as an astringent (24). One successful attempt to graft European chestnut (Castanea sativa) scions to tanoak stumps has been reported from southern Mendocino County.",Special Uses,Tanoak,lithocarpus,densiflorus,hardwood,16,0
"Turkey oak is commonly associated with longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), and sand (dwarf) post oak (Q. stellata var. margaretta). Depending on location it can also be associated with sand pine (Pinus clausa), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), southern red oak (Q. falcata), live oak (Q. uirginiana), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), sand hickory (Carya pallida), mockernut hickory (C.tomentosa), and black cherry (Prunus serotina). Understory, depending on the part of the range considered, can include sassafras (Sassafras albidum), persimmon (Diospyros uirginiana), pawpaw (Asimina spp.), dwarf huckleberry, deerberry, and tree sparkleberry (Vaccinium spp.), New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), gopher-apple (Geobalanus oblongifolius), blackberry (Rubus spp.), crooked wood (Lyonia spp.), scrub hickory (Carya floridana), myrtle oak Quercus myrtifolia), Chapman oak (Q. chapmanii), sand live oak (Q. uirginiana var. geminata), and poison-sumac (Toxicodendron vernix).

Turkey oak is limited to the dry pinelands and sandy ridges of the southeastern Coastal Plain from southeast Virginia to central Florida and west to southeast Louisiana (14). It reaches its maximum development in a subtropical climate. This oak grows on approximately 3.5 to 4 million ha (9 to 10 million acres) of land in Florida alone (27). -The native range of turkey oak.,Native Range,Turkey Oak,quercus,laevis,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Turkey oak is monoecious; staminate flowers are borne in naked aments and pistillate flowers in flowered spikes on the same tree (23). The flowers appear in April or late spring. The fruit (a nut, called an acorn) requires 2 years to mature (25). Seed Production and Dissemination- In central Florida, turkey oak seed production was sampled on 40 trees over a 7-year period (10). The trees failed to produce fruit only 1 year. Average fruit production, based on an average weight per fallen acorn of 2.55 g (0.09 oz) and an average stand density of 178 trees per hectare (72/acre), was 150 ± 27 kg/ha (134 24 lb/acre). Production ranged from a high of 312 76 kg/ha (278 ± 68 lb/acre) to a low of 24 ± 8 kg/ha (21 ± 7 lb/acre). Acorn production for two turkey oak stands and 10 open-grown trees was studied at Georgetown, SC (8). Average annual acorn production for open-grown trees, 13 cm (5 in) in d.b.h. and larger, was 0.18 to 0.54 kg (0.4 to 1.2 lb) per tree and 0.05 to 0.23 kg (0.1 to 0.5 lb) per tree for those of similar size growing under stand conditions. Average weight of green, fresh acorns varied from 4.6 to 6.0 g (0.16 to 0.21 oz). Variation in acorn crops occurred annually between stands and individual trees. Stand density has a minimum influence on acorn production of individual trees. A mature, unthinned stand of 370 trees per hectare (150/acre) may be thinned up to 50 percent without significantly reducing acorn production when the best producers are left in the stand (10). The heavy fruits do not roll far from their source. Small animals do not help their dissemination to any marked degree; instead they prevent dispersion by eating the fruits. Rodents are the worst offenders (21). Seedling Development- Based on two samples, average germinative capacity was 82 percent after a cold stratification period of 60 to 90 days (21). Seeds were placed in medium sand with a day temperature equal to 27° C (81° F) and a night temperature of 23° C (73° F). For one sample, cleaned seeds per kilogram totaled 871 (395/lb) (23). In the sandhills, acorns are subjected to great extremes of temperature if they are not buried under litter. If conditions are favorable, germination takes place the following spring. Germination is hypogeal. Studies of dormancy and afterripening indicated that turkey oak acorns required an outdoor afterripening of only 2 months. This may make it possible for them to become established during the very early spring before they are faced with the summer heat and high temperature. Vegetative Reproduction- Oak root collars sprout freely. Fire kills the aboveground stem but stumps sprout vigorously, resulting in an increased number of stems (25).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Turkey Oak,quercus,laevis,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Turkey oak is a moderately fast to fast-growing tree with a relatively short life span. It grows to a height of 6 to 15 m (20 to 50 ft), rarely to 20 m (65 ft) (5). The largest turkey oak on record, growing near Branford, FL, measured 25 m (83 ft) in height, with a d.b.h. of 66 cm (25.8 in), and a crown spread of 20 m (67 ft) (19). In northwest Florida, the density of turkey oak in a stand of large hardwoods, 9 cm (3.5 in) in d.b.h. or larger, ranged from 7,351 to 7,467 stems/ha (2,975 to 3,022 stems/ acre), while in another stand of small hardwoods, 9 cm (3.5 in) in d.b.h. or smaller, density ranged from 8,107 to 8,261 stems/ha (3,281 to 3,343/acre). Turkey oak accounted for 75 percent of the hardwood stems in the stand of large hardwoods and 72 percent in the stand of smaller hardwoods (2). The relative abundance of noncommercial species in 57 study plots located in the sandhills of northwest Florida, based on stems per hectare (acre), was as follows: turkey oak, 4,584 (1,855) or 47 percent of the total; sand post oak, 1,735 (702); bluejack oak, 1,527 (618); saw-palmetto (Serenoa repens), 1,273 (515); and persimmon, 566 (299) (4). A volume table (table 1) was developed from data on turkey oaks growing on a deep sand ridge in Putnam County, FL (7). Measurements of 20 mature turkey oaks growing on the Ocala National Forest in central Florida, averaging 38.9 years in age and ranging from 24 to 49 years, was as follows (10): Rooting Habit- Initially, the young turkey oak seedling develops a long taproot. As the seedling grows, the root system develops much more extensively in comparison with the aboveground stem. This well-developed root system provides the plant with a greater absorbing surface for possible contact with minerals and remote supplies of water as the surface sand dries out. Roots from separate trees will graft together (21,22). Reaction to Competition- The effects of logging are favorable to turkey oak which is classed as intolerant of shade. Fire favors the dominance of more fire-resistant pine. Where fire is an almost yearly occurrence, the herbaceous understory does not become thick enough to support fire of sufficient severity to seriously retard turkey oak. When the understory has accumulated for 3 to 4 years it will carry fire hot enough to kill even large turkey oaks (13). Establishment of pine plantations on the sandhills of northeast Florida necessitates almost complete removal of oaks and grass that compete for soil moisture on these dry sites (3,4). The following characteristics of turkey oaks have contributed to their predominance on sandhill sites: short afterripening period of the acorns with subsequent germination before adverse conditions of summer; vertical leaf orientation, a phototropic response, which may act as a protective mechanism against intense light and high temperature; and development of a deep, extensive root system in seedlings (21). Damaging Agents- Turkey oak was found to be susceptible to oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) in north-central South Carolina (26). In central Florida curculionid weevils (Curculio spp.) were found in 81.2 percent of the acorn crop from 40 turkey oak trees in 1960 and in 36.2 percent of the crop from the same trees in 1962 (10).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Turkey Oak,quercus,laevis,hardwood,14,0
"Turkey oak grows on dry pinelands and sandy ridges or high dunes. These hilly regions lie primarily in the central peninsula of Florida and the sandhills of the two Carolinas. Soils of these droughty sites are Entisols; they often lack clay-size particles within 3.0 m (10 ft) of the surface, are low in organic matter, and are strongly acid. Depth to water table is more than 152 cm (60 in) (18,21).",Soils and Topography,Turkey Oak,quercus,laevis,hardwood,15,0
"The seasoned wood of turkey oak is excellent fuel and widely used as a firewood. The bark and twigs contain valuable materials for tanning leather. The light-brown to light reddish-brown wood is close-grained, hard, and heavy, but the trees do not grow large enough, on the average, to have timber value (5,16,23,24). Turkey oak acorns have been identified as a major food source for black bear, white-tailed deer, northern bobwhite, and wild turkey in Florida (9,11,17,20). Site preparation decreased game-food plants by virtually eliminating the scrub oak and the acorns and browse they produce, and, except for the first few years after chopping, substituted no food plants of comparable value (12). In longleaf pine-turkey oak habitat in central Florida, complete removal of all turkey oaks on 259-ha (1-mi²) plots caused a pronounced reduction in deer use, especially during the fall (1).",Special Uses,Turkey Oak,quercus,laevis,hardwood,16,0
"Virginia pine often grows in pure stands, usually as a pioneer species on old fields, burned areas, or other disturbed sites. It is a major species in the forest cover types Virginia Pine-Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 78) and Virginia Pine (Type 79) (17). It is an associate in the following cover types: Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40), Bear Oak (Type 43), Chestnut Oak (Type 44), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), Pitch Pine (Type 45), Eastern Redcedar (Type 46), Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Loblolly Pine (Type 81), and Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82). Other than those named in the types, species that commonly grow with Virginia pine in various parts of its range are white oak Quercus alba), southern red oak (Q. falcata), red maple (Acer rubrum), hickories (Carya spp.), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens), and eastern white pine (P. strobus). In central Pennsylvania, two ground-cover types serve as indicators of site quality for Virginia pine. The flowering dogwood/clubmoss (Cornus florida / Lycopodium) type indicates the better site indexes ranging from 15.2 to 21.3 m (50 to 70 ft); the bear oak/reindeer moss (Quercus ilicifolia / Cladonia) type indicates average and poor site indexes between 9.1 to 15.2 m (30 and 50 ft) (39).",Associated Forest Cover,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,1,1
The annual precipitation in the native range of Virginia pine averages 890 to 1400 mm (35 to 55 in) and is fairly well distributed throughout the year. Rainfall generally is greatest in the southwestern portion of the range. The climate throughout most of this area is classified as humid. Summer temperatures average about 21° to 24° C (70° to 75° F); winter temperatures range from -4° to 4° C (25° to 40° F); and the average number of frost-free days varies from more than 225 on the eastern and southern edge of the Piedmont to 160 days on the more mountainous areas to the west and north.,Climate,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,2,1

"Virginia pine generally grows throughout the Piedmont and at lower elevations in the mountains from central Pennsylvania southwestward to northeastern Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia. It is also found in the Atlantic Coastal Plain as far north as New Jersey and Long Island, NY, and extends westward in scattered areas into Ohio, southern Indiana, and Tennessee. - The native range of Virginia pine.",Native Range,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,11,1
"Most of the variation in Virginia pine is attributable to differences among individual trees or stands rather than to geographic origin, though it is suspected that populations in the Talladega Mountains of central Alabama and on the deep sands of the mid-Atlantic Coast are distinct ecotypes (25). A range-wide sample of 2,114 trees revealed no evidence of north-south or east-west trends in specific gravity (unextracted wood) (12). In studies of six wood properties of mature Virginia pine in Kentucky and Tennessee, variation usually was greater within a stand than among stands. However, tracheid length increased from south to north within this region (42). Progeny tests of trees from the same locations also revealed significant variation in monoterpene content and in stem volume at age 5. This variation was attributable to difference among stands and among individual trees within stands (29,34). These and other progeny tests indicate that tree improvement programs for Virginia pine can significantly improve the stem form and growth rate. Seeds from local sources or from locations with a climate similar to that of the planting site generally produce trees with the best survival and growth rates. Seed from southern provenances produce fast-growing trees on southern sites, but southern trees grow slowly and suffer winter injury when planted in the north (20,21).",Population Differences,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Virginia pine is monoecious. Pollen shedding and female cone receptivity begin about the middle of March in the southern part of the species range, and as late as the latter part of May in the northern part. Virginia pine is wind pollinated and primarily outcrossing, though self-fertilization is possible. Fertilization takes place in early June some 13 months later, when the cones have nearly reached full size. Seeds become viable by middle to late August of the year after pollination but are difficult to extract before cone maturation, which occurs from late September to early November. Unlike many other pines, Virginia pine produces cones in all parts of the crown. Empty cones usually persist on the tree for several years and can remain for as many as 15 years. Seed Production and Dissemination- Open-grown trees often produce cones as early as 5 years of age, and a few trees have been known to flower at 18 months (3). In dense stands, cone production can be delayed for as many as 50 years. As stands become more open, cone production is accelerated (36). Virginia pine produces some seed each year, with heavy cone crops occurring at intervals of 3 or more years. Good cone crops can be produced in 2 successive years, however, and peak seed years do not necessarily coincide throughout the range. Early cone production is under strong genetic control and can be increased by family selection or fertilization (7,9). Seed dispersal starts in October and is complete within 3 months, though some seeds may continue to be released until the following spring. Most of the seeds fall within 30 m (100 ft) of trees with an average height of 18 m (60 ft); however, stocking often is adequate at greater distances, particularly on the lee side of a seed source. In the coastal plain of Maryland, seedfall was measured on a 40-meter-wide (132 ft) strip cut through Virginia pine. Over a 4-year period, seedfall per hectare ranged from 15,800 to 98,800 (6,400 to 40,000/acre) (18). The number of clean seeds per kilogram ranges from 100,750 to 200,800 (45,700 to 91,100/lb); the average is 122,100 (55,400/lb) (35). Seed and cone insects can severely reduce the yield of viable seed. Seed yields from cones from which insects were excluded by wire screens were twice as high as those from unprotected cones (8). Major insect pests are two types of seedbugs: the shieldbacked pine seedbug (Tetyra bipunctata) and the southern pine seedbug (Leptoglossus corculus). Several types of coneworms (Dioryctria spp.) and cone borers (Eucosma spp.) also infect Virginia pine. The Virginia pine sawfly (Neodiprion pratti pratti) and Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia frustrana) can destroy young conelets (16). Seedling Development- An exposed mineral soil seedbed is essential for successful establishment of seedlings. In one study area in the southern Appalachians, all regeneration of Virginia pine over a 120-year period was related to site disturbances by fires or logging (1). Such site disturbance can result in two to four times as much germination as on undisturbed seedbeds, and 2-year survival that is four times as great (41). Exposing wet Virginia pine seeds to artificial light before sowing greatly increases germination. Maximum germination is obtained by exposing seeds that have been soaked in water for 24 hours to 30 minutes of red light. The stimulus to germination by this exposure can be reversed by treatment with far-red light (39). Germination is epigeal (35). Seedlings require direct sunlight for best growth. Even partial shade reduces growth, and seedlings do not survive under full shade. Given adequate light and a good seedbed, however, several thousand seedlings per hectare can become established. Precommercial thinning at age 5 has been recommended to prevent stagnation in heavily stocked seedling stands (11). Virginia pine seedlings grown in containers in the greenhouse can be used to advance growth and cone production by 1 year compared to the use of bare-root stock (6). Extra light from an incandescent source coupled with a high level of nutrition can quadruple height growth in one season. Long photoperiods also induce other effects such as increased internodal length, accelerated cycles of bud formation, and breaking of bud dormancy (39). The balance and relative abundance of inorganic elements in the soil solution also are important to the establishment and growth of Virginia pine. In basic nutrition studies in irrigated sand cultures, symptoms of deficiency appeared when either potassium or magnesium was supplied at 0.01 milliequivalent (meq) or less per liter. Amounts adequate for healthy height growth were 0.35 meq of calcium and 2 meq of magnesium per liter. The adequacy level for potassium was between 0.1 and 1 meq; the minimum levels for nitrogen and phosphorus were 1.78 and 0.03 meq, respectively (39). Virginia pine seedlings are more tolerant of low soil moisture than most other pines. Although they may survive when moisture is low, their rate of growth is slower on dry sites. Seedlings reach a height of 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) in the first year when growth conditions are favorable. At the end of 10 years, the average height may reach 5 m (17 ft) on the better sites. Many species of mycorrhizae representing nine genera (Amanita, Boletus, Cenococcum, Gomphidius, Lepiota, Paxillus, Rhizopogon, Russula, and Scleroderma) are known to form associations with the roots of Virginia pine (23). Vegetative Reproduction- Sprout growth on Virginia pine is rare. Occasionally, cut stubs produce a few short-lived sprouts from dormant buds. Rooting of cuttings from 7- and 8-year-old Virginia pine is most successful (72 percent rooted) when cuttings were taken in December and treated with 0.2 percent indolebutyric acid before being placed in a mist chamber (40). Cuttings from 1-year-old seedlings also can be rooted, but those taken from mature trees fail to root (25). Grafting generally is about 65 percent successful when dormant scions are grafted onto dormant rootstock. The side-veneer graft technique is most commonly used, but other methods also are successful. Virginia pine grafts are more susceptible to mold than grafts of the other southern pines (25). Clonal plantlets can be obtained from tissue cultures when cotyledons from Virginia pine embryos are used. However, the rooting techniques necessary for commercial production of these plantlets have not yet been developed (10).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- On average sites, well-stocked stands can have as many as 3,950 stems per hectare (1,600/acre) at 20 years of age. The number drops to about 500/ha (200/acre) in 70-year-old stands. The site index for Virginia pine is the average height of dominant trees measured at age 50 years. In North Carolina, the average merchantable volume per hectare for site index 18.2 m (60 ft) land is 112 m³ (1,600 ft³/acre) at 20 years and 354 m³ (5,050 ft³/acre) at 70 years (36). Volumes for Maryland are intermediate between the higher values for North Carolina and the lower values for Pennsylvania. In a regional study extending from Maryland to South Carolina, merchantable volumes per hectare for fully stocked, pure, 60-year-old stands ranged from 155 m³/ha (2,210 ft³/acre) for site index 16.8 m (55 ft) land to 602 m³/ha (8,600 ft³/acre) for site index 24.4 m (80 ft) land (31). On the best sites, trees can reach a height of 37 m (120 ft) at maturity, but the average height ranges from 15 to 23 m (50 to 75 ft) at age 50. An annual growth rate of 6 m³/ha (1 cord/acre) is possible over a large portion of its natural range. Because Virginia pine is shallow rooted and subject to windthrow and to damage from ice and snow, thinning is not recommended in older stands. In one thinned 17-year-old stand the diameter growth of trees was 50 percent greater than that of controls; however, there was no overall stand response because of frequent windthrow in the thinned stand. Windthrow is not serious in younger stands, which can be thinned safely, but the growth response in these stands may not be sufficient to replace the volume removed by the thinning (19). Virginia pine planted on old fields grows well. One plantation in Iowa had a mean annual height growth of 0.6 m (1.9 ft) after 15 years. This growth was better than that of five other pine species planted on the same sites. The mean annual diameter growth was 8.6 mm (0.34 in) during the same period (39). Plantations in the Cross Timbers area of Oklahoma survived well when moisture was adequate during the year of establishment (32). In the Cumberland Plateau, planted Virginia pine on site index 21.2 m (70 ft) produced a merchantable volume of approximately 140 m³/ha (2,000 ft³/acre) at age 20 (37). In central Tennessee, Virginia pine outperforms shortleaf and loblolly pines on dry ridges and on warm slopes with shallow soil (38). On these sites it is estimated to produce approximately 56 m³ more per hectare (800 ft³ or 4,000 fbm/acre) than shortleaf pine, on a 50-year rotation (22). On good sites in the Piedmont or on cove sites in the southern Appalachians, however, growth of Virginia pine is inferior to the other southern pines. Natural pruning in Virginia pine is slow because the branches are resinous. Rooting Habit- Virginia pine is a shallow-rooted species and losses from windthrow are likely to occur if old stands are thinned excessively (5). Reaction to Competition- Being intolerant of shade, Virginia pine is a transitional type and is eventually replaced by more tolerant hardwood species. It is a pioneer species, coming in after fire, and on eroded areas or wornout old fields. Compared with associated pines, it is generally more successful on poorer sites. Virginia pine seedlings cannot become established under the shade of an existing stand, so hardwoods invade the understory. These hardwoods become dominant and gradually take over the area in succeeding generations, unless fire or other factors retard them (39). Damaging Agents- Heart rot due to Phellinus pini often is present in stands more than 60 years old, but it is rare in stands less than 50 years of age. In a severe case, as much as 34 percent of the trees in a 59-year-old stand were infected (36). Partly because of its susceptibility to heart rot, pulpwood rotations generally are preferred to sawtimber rotations in Virginia pine. The other serious disease of Virginia pine is pitch canker (Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans), which enters twigs or stems through small wounds and causes a heavy exudation of pitch. The canker enlarges rapidly and eventually girdles the twig or stem. Seedlings infected with pitch canker have a mortality rate of about 90 percent (15). Some variation in susceptibility to pitch canker appears to have a genetic basis (2). Other diseases usually cause little loss of growth in Virginia pine. Stem cankers (Atropellis tingens), eastern gall rust (Cronartium quercuum), a stem rust (C. comptoniae), root rot (Heterobasidion annosum), and butt rots (Poria subacida, Phaeolus schweinitizii) occasionally infest Virginia pine. The principal forest insects that cause significant damage to Virginia pine are the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), Ips spp., and pine sawflies, the Virginia pine sawfly (Neodiprion pratti pratti) and the redheaded pine sawfly (N. lecontei). Trees under stress of lightning, fire, or logging injury are more susceptible to insect attack than sound healthy trees (39). The pales weevil (Hylobius pales), which feeds on and often kills small seedlings of several pine species, can greatly reduce the regeneration of Virginia pine. Attacks are most likely on recently cutover areas where pine roots provide the food needed to build up a large larval population. Girdling by meadow mice can cause considerable damage in young trees. In Tennessee, they have reportedly caused heavy mortality in 8- or 9-year-old plantations (26). In Maryland and Iowa, they have shown a strong preference for Virginia pine over other pine species (39). Young Virginia pines are particularly vulnerable to fire because of their thin bark and their lack of long-lived dormant buds at the base, along the bole, and in the crown. Fire reduces the Virginia pine component in stands where this species is mixed with pitch, shortleaf, or loblolly pines. The species also is sensitive to several air pollutants. Of 18 pine species tested, Virginia pine was most sensitive to ozone; 69 percent of the seedlings suffered foliar damage. Polluted air containing sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen also reduced terminal growth, with most damage occurring between the 4th and 13th weeks after budbreak. Dormant seedlings are resistant to ozone pollution (14,33).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,14,1
"Virginia pine grows well on a variety of soils derived from marine deposits, from crystalline rocks, sandstones, and shales, and from limestone to a lesser extent. These are classified as Spodosols and Inceptisols. After harvesting or fire, these soils are subject to moderate sheet and gully erosion; erosion can become severe on shale soils. On many areas that now support Virginia pine, much of the A horizon is gone because of past erosion under intensive agricultural use. The species grows best on clay, loam, or sandy loam; it generally does poorly on serpentine soils, shallow shaly soils, and very sandy soils. It thrives only in moderately well drained to well drained soils and is less tolerant of wet sites and impeded drainage than pitch and loblolly pines (Pinus rigida and P. taeda). Virginia pine generally tolerates soil acidities ranging from pH 4.6 to 7.9 (39). Soil beneath a Virginia pine stand was more acidic and contained more organic matter than soil under shortleaf (P. echinata), loblolly, or white (P. strobus) pine stands (30). Virginia pine usually is found at elevations of 15 to 760 m (50 to 2,500 ft). It comes in freely on abandoned farmland throughout its range.",Soils and Topography,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,15,1
"Of the southern conifers, Virginia pine is most preferred as a Christmas tree. If families with desirable traits are selected and appropriate cultural practices are used, marketable Christmas trees can be produced in as few as 3 years, although the usual rotation age for Virginia pine Christmas trees is 5 to 10 years (4,24). In the Eastern and Central States, Virginia pine performs well when planted on strip-mined sites. In a study in West Virginia, Virginia pine survived well, grew quickly, and encountered no serious pests 14 years after being planted on a mined site (43). It is also a satisfactory species for the reclamation of spoil banks in the Southeast (27). Because the wood of older trees is frequently softened by fungal decay, Virginia pine provides nesting habitat for woodpeckers. Leaving old, decayed trees near the margins of clearcuts provides nesting sites (13).",Special Uses,Virginia Pine,pinus,virginiana,conifer,16,1

"Water hickory inhabits the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from southeastern Virginia to southern Florida, west into eastern Texas, and the Mississippi Valley north to southern Illinois (5). -The native range of Carya aquatica. Water hickory grows in a warm, humid climate throughout its range. The average annual precipitation varies from 1020 to 1520 mm (40 to 60 in). A mean rainfall of 640 mm (25 in) occurs during the April through September growing season. The mean January temperature is 2° to 16° C (35° to 60° F); mean July temperature, about 27° C (80° F); and an average frost-free period of 200 to 300 days. Water hickory attains its best growth on moist but well-drained loamy or silty soils in the Mississippi River Valley and along some Coastal Plain streams. However, because of its slow growth rates, it is rare on these sites except where it has been favored by repeated ""high-grade"" logging (5). Water hickory more commonly occupies wet sites where only a few species of hardwoods survive. It is common on clay flats, sloughs, and backwater areas, but seldom in coastal swamps or sites where soils are continually saturated. The species is most common on soils in the Vertic Haplaquepts subgroup of the order Inceptisols. Water hickory sites are subject to inundation during heavy rains and stream overflow, as well as severe drying with cracking of the soil during occasional dry summers. Water hickory is a major component of two forest cover types: Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Society of American Foresters Type 93) and Overcup Oak-Water Hickory (Type 96). It is a minor component in Sweetgurn-Willow Oak (Type 92) and is sometimes found on the edge of Baldcypress (Type 101) and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102) (2). Important associated tree species are overcup, Nuttall, and willow oaks Quercus lyrata, Q. nuttallii and Q. phellos); cedar and American elms (Ulmus crassifolia and U. americana); waterlocust and honeylocust (Gleditsia aquatica and G. triacanthos); pecan; green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica); sugarberry (Celtis laevigata); persimmon (Diospyros virginiana); red maple (Acer rubrum); and baldcypress (Taxodium distichum). The most frequent noncommercial trees and shrubs associated with water hickory are hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), swamp-privet (Forestiera acummata), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), possumhaw (Ilex decidua), and water-elm (Planera aquatica).",Habitat,Water Hickory,carya,aquatica,hardwood,8,0
"Water hickory regenerates aggressively from seeds and sprouts. Seeds germinate and become established on disturbed soil or understory duff. To develop, understory seedlings must be released. Many of our present stands of water hickory, especially on imperfectly drained flats, have been regenerated and released by heavy preferential logging of more valuable species. On poorly drained sites, where competition is not so intense, water hickory grows to fill openings created by windthrow and natural mortality as well as logging. Flowering and Fruiting- Water hickory is monoecious. Male and female flowers appear during April and May, while the leaves are developing. The male flowers are in stalked catkins on branches of the current or previous year, and the female flowers are in short spikes or stalks. The fruit, covered by a thin husk during development, are thin-shelled, flattened, and have a bitter seed. Nuts fall between October and December of the same year. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production begins when the trees are about 20 years old, or about 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. (9). Optimum seed-bearing age is from 40 to 75 years, or after the trees reach 51 cm (20 in) in d.b.h. Heavy seed crops are produced in most years, and a thrifty tree may produce up to 70 liters (2 bu) of seeds. There are approximately 440 cleaned seeds per kilogram (200/lb). The seeds are disseminated by water and animals; floodwaters are particularly important in carrying seed to new areas. Seedling Development- After seedfall in the autumn, the seeds lie dormant until germination in late April through early June. Rarely do they remain viable until the second spring. Germination is hypogeal. Sometimes nearly 80 percent of the seed crop germinates (6). As a result, thickets and clumps of water hickory are not unusual. The species is tolerant enough to survive in the understory for at least 15 years, but full sunlight is necessary for development into trees (4). The relatively slow height growth of water hickory requires that it have near freedom from competition to establish itself in the overstory. Because of their extended dormant season, water hickory seedlings are able to survive late-spring floods better than most of their would-be competitors. Vegetative Reproduction- Stumps less than 61 cm (24 in) and severed roots of water hickory readily sprout. Sprouts grow three or four times faster than seedlings during the first year or two. Even on poorly drained clay soil, first-year sprouts sometimes are 1.5 in (5 ft) tall. Sprouts 4.6 m (15 ft) tall at 5 years have been reported. Growth and Yield- Water hickory on a good site may reach 33.5 m (110 ft) tall and 91 cm (36 in) in diameter (6), with about 16 in (52 ft) of merchantable bole. The tall straight trunk is topped by slender to moderately stout ascending branches. Diameter growth of water hickory is slow for southern species, 2 to 8 mm (0.08 to 0.31 in) per year. At 50 years, dominants might average 35 cm (14 in) in d.b.h. on good sites and only 25 cm (10 in) on poor sites. Site index at base age 50 years ranges between 20 and 29 m (65 and 95 ft). Slow growth rates are typical of water hickory in competition with oaks, sugarberry, gum, and other species on good sites. Maximum mean annual production of a pure stand (found rarely) on a good site has been established at 10.5 m³/ha (150 ft³/acre) (7). Maximum mean annual production on medium and poor sites was estimated at 7.0 m³/ha (100 ft³/acre) and 3.5 m³/ha (50 ft³/acre), respectively. An average water hickory site might realistically yield 210 m³/ha (3,000 ft³/acre) at maturity. Slow growth and poor sites usually keep yields low. Rooting Habit- Water hickory, like other hickories, grows a taproot in the seedling stage. The wet clayey soils where water hickory usually is found restricts the entire root system to fairly shallow depths. The taproot eventually becomes the source of a coarse, widespreading but shallow lateral root system. The taproot of a 30-cm (12-in) individual, excavated on moderately well-drained clayey soil, ended abruptly with three large lateral roots growing out at right angles. Only a few fine roots extended deeper than 50 cm (20 in). Reaction to Competition- Water hickory is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance. Owing to its slow growth, poor quality, and consequent low value, most silvicultural operations are intended to favor species other than water hickory. Much ""high-grade"" logging has made the species more abundant and widespread than it would have been naturally. Water hickory responds well to release. On better drained sites, cutting or deadening all stems above 5 cm (2 in) in d.b.h. should relegate water hickory to a minor position in the future stand. Many seedlings and sprouts may emerge, but most of these are eventually overtopped by faster growing species. In the Overcup Oak-Water Hickory cover type, any kind of harvest will probably result in a major component of water hickory in the future stand. Water control projects that prolong spring flooding tend to favor water hickory. Damaging Agents- Water hickory is occasionally damaged by insects. Of several borers that attack water hickory, the living-hickory borer, Goes pulcher, is the most common (10). Borer attacks most often occur on young trees up to 14 cm (5.5 in) in diameter. Trunks weakened by tunnels sometimes break, and logs formerly infested by borers are of low value. Although this borer is widely distributed, damaging populations are rather local. Leaf-eating insects, especially the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, occasionally defoliate trees. Diseases are ordinarily unimportant to water hickory. Butt and stem rots entering through wounds from fire or logging can be a major source of cull. Heart-rot fungi tend to spread faster in the trunks of this species than in associated oaks and other bottom-land hardwoods (3). The major defect of water hickory is ""shake,"" found especially in trees on waterlogged sites; yellow-bellied sapsuckers also cause defects. Water hickory tends to support more mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum) than any of its associated species.",Life History,Water Hickory,carya,aquatica,hardwood,10,0

"Flowering and Fruiting- Water oak is monoecious; staminate flowers are in hanging catkins and pistillate flowers are in few-flowered, short-stalked clusters on the same tree. They develop shortly before or at the same time as the new leaves. Staminate flowers are produced near the tip of the previous year's growth, while pistillate flowers are produced in the junction of the current year's growth (5). The fruit, an acorn, matures about September of the second year. The embryo has no endosperm but two large, fleshy cotyledons (4). Flowers are easily killed by late frosts after leaf buds open. The trees then defoliate and develop new leaves but do not generate a second crop of flowers. Seed Production and Dissemination- Trees bear seed at about age 20 and production seems to alternate between prolific and lean years. Mature trees yield 9 to 53 liters (0.25 to 1.5 bu) of acorns in a good year, with about 64.4 kg/ha (50 lb/bu). The average for cleaned seeds is 880/kg (400/lb) (4). Generally, viable acorns sink in water, while those that float probably will not germinate. Water oak acorns are naturally disseminated by animals and water. Seedling Development- Under controlled conditions, water oak acorns require a pregermination treatment to overcome dormancy. Under natural conditions, they germinate the spring following maturation. They may be induced to germinate by stratification for 30 to 40 days in moist sand at 30° to 32° C (86° to 90° F) during light cycles and for a 52- to 73-day period at 20° to 21° C (68° to 70° F) during dark cycles. Expect 60 to 94 percent germination after 31 to 73 days. Germination is hypogeal (4). Seedlings require abundant moisture the entire growing season but do not tolerate prolonged submersion. Under optimum conditions water oak grows at a rate of 60 cm (24 in) per year for the first 25 years (7).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Water Oak,quercus,nigra,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Water oak can grow to 38 m (125 ft) on a site index range of 18.3 to 33.5 m (60 to 110 ft) at base age 50 years (1). It prunes itself slowly, developing a straight, slender main trunk. Growing quickly on favorable sites, it can produce 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) of d.b.h. growth in 10 years. It can grow 7.8 cm (3.1 in) in d.b.h. in 10 years while in the 36 to 46 cm (14 to 18 in) diameter class; and 7.4 cm (2.9 in) in the 51 to 71 cm (20 to 28 in) class (7). Water oak has a shallow, spreading rooting habit. Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Water oak does not compete well with other species because of its slow early growth and its intolerance to shade and competition. It is a subclimax tree. Water oak germinates under shade, but seedlings require moderate light for development. Epicormic branching is common for water oak in suppressed to intermediate crown position. Stumps will sprout, but vegetative propagation is not economically practical as a management procedure (7). Water oak is easily injured by fire and even a light burn kills stems of seedlings. Survivors are extremely susceptible to butt rot. Damaging Agents- Natural enemies of water oak are primarily insects and microorganisms (2,7,8). Insects include trunk borers (Enaphalodes sp. and Prionoxystus sp.) and leaf hoppers (Erythroneura sp.). The more noticeable diseases include cone rusts (Cronartium spp.), root rot (Ganoderma curtisii), and trunk canker and heart rot caused by a variety of organisms. Additionally, water oak is susceptible to parasitism by mistletoe (Phoradendron flavescens). Herbicides such as 2,4,5-T and picloram compounds are toxic to water oak. It is also highly susceptible to air pollution, probably to sulfur dioxide in particular.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Water Oak,quercus,nigra,hardwood,14,0

"Water tupelo is a major component of the forest cover types Water Tupelo-Swamp Tupelo (Society of American Foresters Type 103) and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102) (8). In stands containing baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo, baldcypress is usually predominant. In sloughs and moving water, water tupelo usually occupies the deeper parts and baldcypress the margins and more shallow parts. In deep, stagnant water the two species occupy much the same depths (19). In several other forest cover types water tupelo may be a minor associate: Longleaf Pine-Slash Pine (Type 83), Slash Pine (Type 84), Slash Pine-Hardwood (Type 85), and Baldcypress (Type 101).

"Flowering and Fruiting- Water tupelo is polygamo-dioecious. The minute, greenish-white flowers appear before or with the leaves in March or April. Pollen is disseminated by wind and probably by bees. Fruits are oblong drupes about 1 to 4 cm (0.5 to 1.5 in) long, with a thick epicarp and fleshy mesocarp. When mature, September through December of the first year, they are dark purple with conspicuous pale dots. Each fruit contains a boney, ribbed, one-seeded stone. Stones range in color from white to dark brown or gray and some are pinkish white. There are about 990 cleaned seeds per kilogram (2.2 lbs) (30). Seeds may be sown in fall in the nursery or may be stratified over winter and sown in the spring. For stratifying, seeds are kept in moist sand or plastic bags at 2° to 4° C (35° to 40° F) (30). Up to 30 months storage does not reduce viability of seeds that have a moisture content of 20 percent or less and are kept in polyethylene bags at a temperature of about 3° C (38° F) (3). Nursery-sown seeds may be drilled 13 to 25 mm (0.5 to 1 in) deep at the rate of 50/m (15/ft) of row, or they may be broadcast and rolled into the soil. A seedbed density of 110 to 165 seedlings/m² (10 to 15 seedlings/ft²) is recommended. From 25 to 37 mm (I to 1.5 in) of sawdust mulch is recommended for broadcast seeds. Seed Production and Dissemination- Forest trees initiate seed production in about 30 years or when they are about 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h. In a South Carolina study, however, viable seeds were produced by 2-year-old stump sprouts (27). Large trees normally produce good to excellent crops each year. Seeds are dispersed mainly by water. As long as the exocarp is intact, the fruit will float. Seeds submerged continuously in water may remain viable for at least 14 months (1). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Seeds do not germinate until water recedes, which may be midway to late in the growing season (29). Partially shaded, wet, poorly-drained soils provide the best seedbed. Seeds buried I to 3 cm (0.5 to 1 in) deep in the soil have a better chance to germinate and establish seedlings than seeds on the soil surface. Seedling survival and development are best in full sunlight and in soil with a pH below 7.0 (25). Seedling development is better in saturated than in well-drained soil, in moving and aerated rather than stagnant water, and in shallow rather than deep water (6,7,11,17). Provided their tops are above water, seedlings can generally survive continuous flooding even if it persists throughout the growing season. Water tupelo is able to survive where it is too wet for most other species because of anatomical and physiological adaptations such as roots that allow for oxidation of the rhizosphere and controlled anaerobic respiration (12,18). Vegetative Reproduction- Water tupelo is a prolific stump sprouter. Stumps of cut seedlings 15 cm (6 in) above ground level may be better sprouters than those 1 cm (0.5 in) in height. Sprouts develop adventitiously from the higher stumps and from suppressed buds on lower stumps (14). Survival and development of sprouts from stumps of larger trees are not always satisfactory, and it may be that the occurrence and persistence of stump sprouts are related to timing and duration of flooding. In South Carolina, trees of sprout origin grew as well as seedlings over a 30-year period (16), but in southern Louisiana few stump sprouts survived beyond 6 years (20). There are no practical techniques for reproducing water tupelo through cuttings or layering.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Water Tupelo,nyssa,aquatica,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Growing season flooding that is just short of continuous may provide near-optimum soil moisture for growth of water tupelo (2). Any drastic change in normal water levels can decrease growth. On a good site in South Carolina, 30-year-old trees of sprout and seed origin averaged about 23 m (75 ft) tall and 33 cm (13 in) in diameter (16). (Note: determination of tree age may be difficult because the species is known to have false rings.) With an abundance of sunlight, trees growing on a good site for 50 to 75 years may reach 51 to 66 cm (20 to 26 in) in diameter above the butt swell, contain from 2 to 3.5 4.9-m (16 ft) logs, and begin development of heartwood (2). In poorly drained swamps in the southeastern United States, average annual production of water tupelo stands was found to be between 6.3 and 7.0 m³/ha (90 and 100 ft³/acre). Ten-year average diameter growth for trees free to grow in unmanaged stands on an average site is about 8 cm (3 in) (28). Growth and Yield were tabulated at 10-year intervals for unmanaged stands in the Atchafalaya Basin of southern Louisiana as follows (9): Under management, a pure even-aged stand carried to 107 cm (42 in) in diameter above the bottleneck is estimated to have an accumulative total yield of 676 m³/ha (48,282 mbf/acre, Doyle log rule) in logs and 441 m/ha (70 cords/acre). These yields are based on an assumed cutting cycle of from 8 to 15 years (28). Basal areas between 57 and 69 m²/ha (250 and 300 ft²/acre) are not uncommon in pure unmanaged second-growth stands. For a less dense water tupelo stand in Florida, the following volumes were recorded (24): Growth and yield of water tupelo in plantations are generally unknown. One small 17-year-old planting at a 1.7 by 1.7 m (5.5 by 5.5 ft) spacing on Falaya silt loam had 89 percent survival. The trees that grew best averaged 13.2 cm (5.2 in) in d.b.h. and were 14.9 m (49 ft) tall (5). Rooting Habit- Water tupelo commonly grows in saturated soils where its shallow root system is characterized by morphological and physiological adaptations that are essential to survival and growth (table 1). Reaction to Competition- Water tupelo is classed as intolerant of shade. It will survive codominant but not overtopping competition. Water tupelo develops in pure, very dense, second-growth stands and has a tendency to stagnate. Unless stagnation is prolonged, it responds to thinning . Damaging Agents- Fire is a major enemy of water tupelo. It scorches the thin bark, allowing entrance of rot-causing fungi. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) is a serious enemy in some years and locations. More than 202,350 ha (500,000 acres) of trees along the gulf coast from Louisiana through Alabama have been defoliated by this insect in a single year (26). Trees annually defoliated seldom die but may have 30 percent or less of the annual diameter growth of unattacked trees. A foliar disease, Mycosphaerella nyssaecola, has caused premature defoliation, but impact has been negligible.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Water Tupelo,nyssa,aquatica,hardwood,14,0
"Water tupelo grows in low, wet flats or sloughs and in deep swamps. Some of the better sites are in the sloughs and swamps along Coastal Plain rivers of the Southeast, such as the Roanoke and Santee, and in the large swamps of southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas. On some sites water may reach a depth of 6 m (20 ft) during rainy seasons and may remain as high as 4 m (13 ft) for long periods (21). Surface water may disappear from water tupelo areas in midsummer or fall, but on better sites soil moisture remains at or near saturation level throughout most of the growing season. Soils that commonly support water tupelo range from mucks and clays to silts and sands and are in the orders Alfisols, Entisols, Histosols, and Inceptisols. Most are moderately to strongly acidic; subsoil frequently is rather pervious. Site index of water tupelo for several Midsouth soils ranges from 21 to 27 m (70 to 90 ft) at 50 years (4).",Soils and Topography,Water Tupelo,nyssa,aquatica,hardwood,15,0
"Since water tupelo is one of the few species that can survive extended periods of inundation, it is favored for planting in very wet microsites, around buildings, in parks, and elsewhere. It is also an important wildlife species. The fruit is consumed by wood ducks, several other kinds of birds, and by squirrels, raccoons, and deer (10). Flowers have some value as a source of tupelo honey. Deer feed on foliage, twigs, and stump sprouts. Water tupelo wood has fine, uniform texture and interlocked grain. When dried properly, the lumber is used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and furniture. Buttresses of trees growing in flooded areas contain wood that is much lighter in weight than that from upper portions of the same trees. The butt portion is probably best suited for pulping products",Special Uses,Water Tupelo,nyssa,aquatica,hardwood,16,0
"Western hemlock is either a major or a minor component in at least 20 forest cover types of the Society of American Foresters (6). The forest cover types may be either seral or climax.

Associates occurring in both the Pacific coast and Rocky Mountain portions of its range include grand fir (Abies grandis), subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), western larch (Larix occidentalis), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), white spruce (P. glauca), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), western white. pine (P. monticola), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). Western hemlock is a component of the redwood forests on the coasts of northern California and adjacent Oregon. In Oregon and western Washington, it is a major constituent of the Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla, and Abies amabilis Zones and is less important in the Tsuga mertensiana and Mixed-Conifer Zones (7). In British Columbia, it is a major element of the Tsuga heterophylla-Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla-Abies amabilis, Tsuga heterophylla, Abies amabilis-Tsuga heterophylla, and Abies amabilis-Tsuga mertensiana Vegetation Zones; it is confined to a distinct understory portion or to moist sites in the Pseudotsuga menziesii-Tsuga heterophylla and Pseudotsuga menziesii Zones (25). In the Rocky Mountains, it is present in the Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylla Vegetation Zones and the lower portion of the Abies lasiocarpa Zone (26). Various persons have described the plant associations and biogeocoenoses in which western hemlock is found; more than 75 are listed for the west coast and more than 30 for the Rocky Mountains (25). Little effort has been made to correlate the communities with one another. Because of its broad range, western hemlock has a substantial number of understory associates. In its Pacific coast range, common shrub species include the following (starred species are also common associates in the Rocky Mountains): vine maple (Acer circinatum), Sitka alder* (Alnus sinuata), Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), snowbrush ceanothus* (Ceanothus velutinus), salal (Gaultheria shallon), oceanspray* (Holodiscus discolor), rustyleaf menziesia* (Menziesia ferruginea), devilsclub* (Oplopanax horridus), Oregon boxwood* (Pachistima myrsinites), Pacific ninebark* (Physocarpus capitatus), Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum), stink currant (Ribes bracteosum), prickly currant* (R. lacustre), thimbleberry* (Rubus parviflorus), salmonberry (R. spectabilis), trailing blackberry (R. ursinus), Pacific red elder (Sambucus callicarpa), common snowberry* (Symphoricarpos albus), Alaska blueberry (Vaccinium alaskaense), big huckleberry (V. membranaceum), ovalleaf huckleberry (V. ovalifolium), evergreen huckleberry (V. ovatum), and red huckleberry (V. parvifolium). The following are other common associates in the Rocky Mountains: creeping western barberry (Berberis repens), russet buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis), birchleaf spirea (Spiraea betulifolia), dwarf blueberry (Vaccinium caespitosum), globe huckleberry (V. globulare), and grouse whortleberry (V. scoparium).

"Western hemlock thrives in a mild, humid climate where frequent fog and precipitation occur during the growing season. Best stands are in the humid and superhumid coastal regions. In subhumid regions with relatively dry growing seasons, western hemlock is confined primarily to northerly aspects, moist stream bottoms, or seepage sites. Within the coastal range of western hemlock, mean annual total precipitation ranges from less than 380 mm (15 in) in Alaska to at least 6650 mm (262 in) in British Columbia. The range in the Rocky Mountains is 560 mm (22 in) to at least 1730 mm (68 in) (25). Mean annual temperatures range from 0.3° to 11.3° C (32.5° to 52.3° F) on the coast and 2.2° to 8.2° C (36.0° to 46.8° F) in the Rocky Mountains. Observed mean July temperatures lie between 11.3° and 19.7° C (52.3° and 67.5° F) along the coast and 14.4° and 20.6° C (58.0° and 69.0° F) in the interior. Mean January temperatures reported for the two areas range from -10.9° to 8.5° C (12.4° to 47.3° F) and -11.1° to -2.4° C (12.0° to 27.6° F), respectively. Recorded absolute maximum temperature for the coast is 40.6° C (105.0° F) and for the Rocky Mountains, 42.2° C (108.0° F). Absolute minimum temperatures tolerated by western hemlock are -38.9° C (-38.0° F) for the coast and -47.8° C (-54.0° F) for the interior. The frost-free period within the coastal range of western hemlock averages less than 100 to more than 280 days (25). In the Rocky Mountains, the frost-free period is 100 to 150 days (20).",Climate,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,2,1
"A natural cross between western hemlock and mountain hemlock, Tsuga x jeffreyi (Henry) Henry, has been reported from the Mount Baker area in Washington. Analysis of polyphenolic pigment suggests that chemical hybrids between western hemlock and mountain hemlock occur but are rare. Intergeneric hybridization between western hemlock and spruce has been discussed in the literature; although similarities exist between the two genera, they do not suggest hybridization (31). Albino individuals or those similarly deficient in chlorophyll have been observed in the wild.",Genetics,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,7,1
"Western hemlock is an important commercial tree species of the Pacific coast and northern Rocky Mountains. Along the Pacific coast, its range extends north along the Coast Ranges from central California to the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, a distance of 3200 km (2,000 mi) (11,18,33). It is the dominant species in British Columbia and Alaska along the Coast Mountains and on the coastal islands. Inland it grows along the western and upper eastern slopes of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington and the west side of the Continental Divide of the northern Rocky Mountains in Montana and Idaho north to Prince George, BC (7,18,26). - The native range of western hemlock.",Native Range,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Western hemlock is monoecious; male and female strobili develop from separate buds of the previous year. Female strobili occupy terminal positions on lateral shoots, whereas the male strobili cluster around the base of the needles (4). Flowering and pollination begin from mid-April to late April in western Oregon and continue into late May and June in coastal Alaska. The solitary, long (19 to 32 mm; 0.75 to 1.25 in), pendent cones mature 120 to 160 days after pollination. Time of maturity of cones on the same branch is variable; ripe cones change from green to golden brown. The cone-scale opening mechanism does not appear to develop fully until late in the ripening period. Seeds are usually fully ripe by mid-September to late September, but cone scales do not open until late October. Empty cones often persist on the tree for 2 or more years. Although flowering may begin on 10-year-old trees, regular cone production usually begins when trees reach 25 to 30 years of age. Mature trees are prolific producers of cones. Some cones are produced every year, and heavy crops occur at average intervals of 3 to 4 years; however, for a given location, the period between good crops may vary from 2 to 8 years or more. For example, in Alaska, good seed crops occur on an average of 5 to 8 years. Seed Production and Dissemination- There are 56,760 to 83,715 cones per hectoliter (20,000 to 29,500/bu). Each cone contains 30 to 40 small seeds. Extraction and cleaning yields an average of 0.79 kg of seed per hectoliter (0.61 lb/bu) of cones. There are 417,000 to over 1,120,000 with an average 573,000 seeds per kilogram (189,000 to 508,000/lb; average 260,000). Slightly less than one-half of the seeds extracted from the cones are viable. In coastal Oregon, more than 19.8 million seeds per hectare (8 million/acre) were released during each of two good seed years from 100-year-old stands, or about 30.3 kg/ha (27 lb/acre). In 1951, a hemlock-spruce stand in Alaska produced 96.4 kg/ha (86 lb/acre) of western hemlock seed. In the Rocky Mountains, western hemlock consistently produces more seed than its associates in the Tsuga heterophylla Zone. Cone scales of western hemlock open and close in response to dry and wet atmospheric conditions. Under wet conditions, seed may be retained in the cones until spring. Western hemlock seed falls at a rate of 80 cm (31 in) per second (27). Released in a strong wind, it can be blown more than 1.6 km (1 mi). In a wind of 20 km (12.5 mi) per hour, seed released at a height of 61 m (200 ft) traveled up to 1160 m (3,800 ft); most fell within 610 m (2,000 ft) of the point of release (19). Seedfall under a dense canopy is 10 to 15 times greater than that within 122 m (400 ft) of the edge of timber in an adjacent clearcut. Seedling Development- Western hemlock seeds are not deeply dormant; stratification for 3 to 4 weeks at 1° to 4° C (33° to 39° F) improves germination and germination rate. The germination rate is sensitive to temperature; optimum temperature appears to be 20° C (68° F). For each 5° C (9° F) drop below the optimum, the number of days required for germination is nearly doubled. Given sufficient time (6 to 9 months) and an absence of pathogens, western hemlock will germinate at temperatures just above freezing (4). Germination is epigeal. Western hemlock seeds remain viable only into the first growing season after seedfall. Provided adequate moisture is available, seed germination and germinant survival are excellent on a wide range of materials. Seeds even germinate within cones still attached to a tree. Western hemlock germinates on both organic and mineral seedbeds; in Alaska, establishment and initial growth are better on soils with a high amount of organic matter. Mineral soils stripped of surface organic material commonly are poor seedbeds because available nitrogen and mineral content is low. In Oregon and Washington, exposed organic materials commonly dry out in the sun, resulting in the death of the seedling before its radicle can penetrate to mineral soil and available moisture. In addition, high temperatures, which may exceed 66° C (150° F) at the surface of exposed organic matter, are lethal. Under such moisture and temperature conditions, organic seedbeds are less hospitable for establishment of seedlings than mineral seedbeds (27). Burning appears to encourage natural regeneration on Vancouver Island; after the third growing season, burned seedbeds had 58 percent more seedlings with better distribution than unburned seedbeds (17). Decaying logs and rotten wood are often favorable seedbeds for western hemlock. Decayed wood provides adequate nutrition for survival and growth of seedlings (23). In brushy areas, seedlings commonly grow on rotten wood where there is minimum competition for moisture and nutrients. Seedlings established on such materials frequently survive in sufficient numbers to form a fully stocked stand by sending roots into the soil around or through a stump or log. Because western hemlock can thrive and regenerate on a diversity of seedbeds, natural regeneration can be obtained through various reproduction methods, ranging from single-tree selection to clearcutting. Through careful harvesting of old-growth stands, advance regeneration often results in adequately stocked to overstocked stands. Western hemlock is difficult to grow in outdoor nurseries. Container-grown stock appears to result in higher quality seedlings, less damage to roots, and better survival than does bare root stock. Initial growth is slow; 2-year-old seedlings are commonly less than 20 cm (8 in) tall. Once established, seedlings in full light may have an average growth rate of 60 cm (24 in) or more annually. Vegetative Reproduction- Western hemlock can be propagated by layering and from cuttings. Seedlings that die back to the soil surface commonly sprout from buds near the root collar. Sprouting does not occur from the roots or the base of larger saplings. Western hemlock grafts readily. Incompatibility between the scion and rootstock does not appear to be a problem. Growth of grafted material is better than that of rooted material.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Western hemlock may form pure stands or be a component of mixed stands. Young stands vary in stocking, but understocking is infrequent. Natural 20-year-old stands can have 14,800 to 24,700 or more stems per hectare (6,000 to 10,000/acre). Stocking levels of 1,480 to 1,790 stems per hectare (600 to 725/acre) at crown closure are believed to provide the best yields if commercial thinnings are part of the management regime (12). If thinnings are not planned, stocking levels as low as 740 well-distributed trees per hectare (300/acre) can provide maximum yields at rotation age (27). The response of western hemlock to nitrogen fertilizer is extremely variable. It appears to vary by geographic location and stocking level. For overstocked stands, a combination of precommercial thinning and fertilizer often gives the best response. Comparative yield data from paired British plantations strongly suggest that western hemlock commonly outproduces two of its most important associates, Douglas-fir and Sitka spruce (1). Natural stands of western hemlock along the Pacific coast attain appreciably higher yields than Douglas-fir stands having the same site index (34); the weighted mean annual increment of western hemlock for some common forest soils in Washington is 33 to 101 percent more than the mean annual increment for Douglas-fir (30). On the Olympic Peninsula, western hemlock out-produces Douglas-fir by 25 to 40 percent. Similar relationships occur in south coastal British Columbia (12). The higher mean annual increment of western hemlock apparently is due to the ability of western hemlock stands to support more trees per hectare; individual trees also have better form than other species and hence better volume (at least 4 to 14 percent) (34). Mixed stands of western hemlock and Sitka spruce are especially productive. In the Picea sitchensis Zone of Oregon and Washington, the mean annual increment of such stands frequently exceeds 42 m³/ha (600 ft³/acre). At higher elevations and farther north, mixed stands of western hemlock and Pacific silver fir are also highly productive. Yield data for natural stands are given in table 1. Volumes predicted for normally stocked stands may actually underestimate potential yields by 20 to 50 percent. Data from British Columbia suggest greater yields can be had if a high number of stems per hectare are maintained (12). Yields of western hemlock on the best sites can exceed 1848 m³/ha (26,400 ft³/acre) at 100 years of age. Western hemlock forests are among the most productive forests in the world. The biomass production of several western hemlock stands with a site index (base 100 years) of 43 m (140 ft) was investigated at the Cascade Head Experimental Forest near Lincoln City, OR. The biomass of standing trees of a 26-year-old, nearly pure western hemlock stand was 229 331 kg/ha (204,614 lb/acre) and that of a 121-year-old stand with a spruce component of 14 percent was 1 093 863 kg/ha (975,966 lb/acre). Net primary productivity per year for these two stands was estimated to be 37 460 and 22 437 kg/ha (33,423 and 20,019 lb/acre). Net primary productivity appears to peak at about 30 years, then declines rapidly for about 50 years. Foliar biomass in the stands at Cascade Head averages 22 724 kg/ha (20,275 lb/acre) with a leaf area of 46.5 m²/m² (46.5 ft²/ft²) (8, 10). By comparison, available data indicate much lower values for highly productive Douglas-fir stands- 12 107 kg/ha and 21.4 m²/m² (10,802 lb/acre and 21.4 ft²/ft² ), respectively. On the best sites, old-growth trees commonly reach diameters greater than 100 cm (39.6 in); maximum diameter is about 275 cm (108 in). Heights of 50 to 61 m (165 to 200 ft) are not uncommon; maximum height is reported as 79 m (259 ft). Trees over 300 years old virtually cease height growth (27). Maximum ages are typically over 400 but less than 500 years. The maximum age recorded, in excess of 700 years, is from the Queen Charlotte Islands (16). Several major associates (Douglas-fir, western redcedar, Alaska-cedar) typically reach much greater ages. Rooting Habit- Western hemlock is a shallow-rooted species; it does not develop a taproot. The roots, especially the fine roots, are commonly most abundant near the surface and are easily damaged by harvesting equipment and fire. Reaction to Competition- Western hemlock is rated to be very tolerant of shade. Only Pacific yew and Pacific silver fir are considered to have equal or greater tolerance of shade than western hemlock. Western hemlock responds well to release after a long period of suppression. Advance regeneration 50 to 60 years old commonly develops into a vigorous, physiologically young-growth stand after complete removal of the overstory; however, poor response to release has been noted for suppressed trees over 100 years old. Advance regeneration up to 1.4 m (4.5 ft) tall appears to respond better to release than taller individuals. Because of its shade tolerance, it is an ideal species for management that includes partial cutting; however, if it is present and the management goal is for a less tolerant species, normal partial cutting practices are not recommended. Under conditions of dense, even-aged stocking, early natural pruning occurs, tree crowns are usually narrow, and stem development is good. Given unrestricted growing space, the quality of western hemlock logs is reduced because of poorly formed stems and persistent branches. Trees that develop in an understory vary greatly in form and quality. The successional role of western hemlock is clear; it is a climax species either alone or in combination with its shade-tolerant associates. Climax or near-climax forest communities along the Pacific coast include western hemlock, western hemlock-Pacific silver fir, western hemlock-western redcedar, Pacific silver fir-western hemlock-Alaska-cedar, and western hemlock-mountain hemlock. The longevity of some associates of western hemlock makes it difficult to determine if some of these near-climax communities will develop into pure western hemlock stands or if western hemlock will ultimately be excluded. Climax or near-climax communities in the Rocky Mountains include western hemlock, western hemlock-western redcedar, and occasionally subalpine fir-western hemlock. In the last community, western hemlock plays a distinctly minor role (26). Damaging Agents- Many agents adversely affect the growth, health, and quality of western hemlock trees and stands. Because of its thin bark and shallow roots, western hemlock is highly susceptible to fire. Even light ground fires are damaging. Prescribed burning is an effective means of eliminating western hemlock advance regeneration from a site. Because of its shallow roots, pole-size and larger stands of western hemlock are subject to severe windthrow. Thousands of hectares of young stands dominated by coastal western hemlock have originated after such blowdown. Western hemlock suffers frost damage in the Rocky Mountains, especially along the eastern edge of its range where frost-killed tops are reported (20,26). Snowbreak occurs locally; it appears to be most common east of the Cascade and Coast Mountains, and especially in the Rocky Mountains. On droughty sites, top dieback is common; in some exceptionally dry years, entire stands of hemlock saplings die. Suddenly exposed saplings may suffer sunscald. Excessive amounts of soil moisture drastically reduce growth. Western hemlock is one of the species most sensitive to damage by sulfur dioxide (16). Spring applications of the iso-octyl esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in diesel oil can kill leader growth of the last 3 years. Severe fluting of western hemlock boles is common in southeast Alaska, much less common on Vancouver Island, and relatively uncommon in Washington and Oregon. There appears to be a clinal gradient from north to south; the causal factor is not known. No foliage diseases are known to cause serious problems for western hemlock. Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium tsugense) is a serious parasite along the Pacific coast from California nearly to Glacier Bay, AK; its presence on western hemlock in the Rocky Mountain States is unconfirmed. It increases mortality, reduces growth, lowers fiber quality, and provides an entryway for decay fungi. Uninfected to lightly infected trees may have a greater growth in volume (40 percent) and height (84 percent) than severely infected trees; in mature stands, volume losses as high as 4.2 m³/ha (60 ft³/acre) per year have been reported (29). Dwarf mistletoe in western hemlock is easy to control; success is nearly 100 percent if methods of sanitation are good. Armillaria mellea, Heterobasidion annosum, Phaeolus schweinitzii, Laetiporus sulphureus, Inonotus tomentosus, Poria subacida, and Phellinus weiri are the major root and butt pathogens of western hemlock. Armillaria mellea occurs widely, seldom kills trees directly, and is not a major source of cull. Heterobasidion annosum, the most serious root pathogen of western hemlock, can limit the alternatives available for intensive management (3). The incidence of infected trees in unthinned western hemlock stands ranges from 0 to more than 50 percent. In some thinned stands, every tree is infected. Heterobasidion annosum spores colonize freshly cut stumps and wounds; the spreading mycelium infects roots and spreads to adjacent trees through root grafts. Treating stumps and wounds with chemicals can reduce the rate of infection. Phellinus weiri is a common root pathogen where Douglas-fir is or was a major component of the stand. In the Rocky Mountains, a similar relationship may exist with western redcedar. Phellinus weiri rapidly extends up into the bole of western hemlock. The first log is frequently hollow; only the sapwood remains. The only practical controls for P. weiri are pulling out the stumps and roots or growing resistant species. High risk bole pathogens include Echinodontium tinctorium, Heterobasidion annosum, and Phellinus weiri. Echinodontium tinctorium causes extensive decay in overmature stands in the Rocky Mountains. It is less destructive in immature stands, although it is found in trees 41 to 80 years old; 46 percent of the trees in this age group in stands studied were infected. Echinodontium tinctorium is of little consequence on the coast. Heterobasidion annosum spreads from the roots into the bole of otherwise vigorous trees. On Vancouver Island, an average of 24 percent (range 0.1 to 70 percent) of the volume of the first 5-m (16-ft) log can be lost to H. annosum (24). Rhizina undulata, a root rot, is a serious pathogen on both natural and planted seedlings on sites that have been burned. It can kill mature trees that are within 8 m (25 ft) of the perimeter of a slash burn (3). Sirococcus strobilinus, the sirococcus shoot blight, causes dieback of the tip and lateral branches and kills some trees in Alaska; the potential for damage is not known (27). Of the important insects attacking western hemlock, only three do not attack the foliage. A seed chalcid (Megastigmus tsugae) attacks cones and seeds; the larva feeds inside the seed. This insect normally is not plentiful and is of little consequence to seed production (14). A weevil (Steremnius carinatus) causes severe damage in coastal British Columbia by girdling seedlings at the ground line. In the Rocky Mountains, the western larch borer (Tetropium velutinum) attacks trees that are weakened by drought, defoliated by insects, or scorched by fire; occasionally it kills trees (9). Since 1917, there have been only 10 years in which an outbreak of the western blackheaded budworm (Acleris gloverana) did not cause visible defoliation somewhere in western hemlock forests (28). Extensive outbreaks occur regularly in southeast Alaska, on the coast of British Columbia, in Washington on the south coast of the Olympic Peninsula and in the Cascade Range, and in the Rocky Mountains. In 1972, nearly 166 000 ha (410,000 acres) were defoliated on Vancouver Island alone. Damage by the larvae is usually limited to loss of foliage and related growth reduction and top kill. Mortality is normally restricted to small stands with extremely high populations of budworms. The western hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria lugubrosa) has caused more mortality of western hemlock than have other insect pests. Outbreaks last 2 to 3 years on any one site and are less frequent than those of the budworm. The greatest number of outbreaks occurs on the south coast of British Columbia; the western hemlock looper is less prevalent farther north. Heavy attacks have been recorded for Washington and Oregon since 1889. The insect is less destructive in the interior forests. Although mortality is greatest in old growth, vigorous 80- to 100-year-old stands are severely damaged. Two other loopers, the greenstriped forest looper (Melanolophia imitata) and the saddleback looper (Ectropis crepuscularia), cause top kill and some mortality. The phantom hemlock looper (Nepytia phantasmaria) in the coastal forest and the filament bearer (Nematocampa filamentaria) play minor roles, usually in association with the western hemlock looper (28). The hemlock sawfly (Neodiprion tsugae) occurs over most of the range of western hemlock. Its outbreaks often occur in conjunction with outbreaks of the western blackheaded budworm. The larvae primarily feed on old needles; hence, they tend to reduce growth rather than cause mortality (9). The hemlock sawfly is considered the second most destructive insect in Alaska (13). Black bear girdle pole-size trees and larger saplings or damage the bark at the base of the trees, especially on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer browse western hemlock in coastal Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The snowshoe hare and the brush rabbit damage hemlock seedlings, principally by clipping off the main stem; clipping of laterals rarely affects survival of seedlings (5). Mountain beaver clip the stems and lateral branches of seedlings and girdle the base of saplings along the coast south of the Fraser River in British Columbia to northern California. Four years after thinning, evidence of girdling and removal of bark was present on 40 percent of the trees (5). Mortality results from both kinds of damage.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,14,1
"Western hemlock grows on soils derived from all bedrock types (except possibly serpentines) within its range. It grows well on sedimentary (argillites, shales, sandstones, limestones), metamorphic (gneisses, marbles, quartzites, schists), and igneous (andesites, basalts, diorites, gabbros, granites) materials. Under appropriate climatic conditions, it thrives on all major landforms-colluvial, eolian, fluvial, lacustrine, marine, morainal, residual, rock, and organic. Western hemlock grows on a variety of soils and is a characteristic species on soils of 6 of the 10 soil orders: Alfisols, Entisols, Histosols, Inceptisols, Spodosols, and Ultisols; and on many great groups, including: Fragiboralfs, Fragiudalfs, Hapludalfs; Fluvaquents, Udifluvents, Quartzipsamments; Borofolists, Cryolfolists; Cryandepts, Dystrandepts, Vitrandepts, Cryaquepts, Haplaquepts, Dystrochrepts, Cryumbrepts, Haplumbrepts; Fragiaquods, Placohumods, Cryorthods, Fragiorthods, Haplorthods; and Haplohumults. It is found on most soil textural classes. Height growth, however, decreases with increasing clay content or soil bulk density. This is attributed to inadequate soil aeration (35) or the inability of roots to penetrate compact soils. Western hemlock thrives on soils with perudic and udic soil moisture regimes. If, however, internal soil drainage is restricted within 1 m (3.3 ft) of the soil surface, height growth decreases (35). Western hemlock is poorly suited to sites where the water table is less than 15 cm (6 in) below the soil surface (22). Although capable of existing on soils with moisture regimes tending toward ustic or xeric, it grows poorly; frequently, tops die back in years of drought. The soil organic horizon under mature stands ranges from less than 7 to more than 57 cm (2.8 to 22.5 in); the average depth increases from 11.4 cm (4.5 in) on soils with good drainage to 43.2 cm (17.0 in) on poorly drained soils (15). Commonly, the majority of roots, especially fine roots, are concentrated just below the organic horizon. The importance of the organic horizon as a continual supply of available nutrients for western hemlock cannot be overstated. In coastal British Columbia, earthworms are common in the organic horizons, even where the pH is less than 4; earthworms may play an important role in making nutrients available for root uptake. On many soils of Oregon and Washington, however, rooting depths exceed 1 m (3.3 ft). Soil reaction (pH) under stands containing western hemlock ranges from less than 3.0 to nearly 6.0 in the organic horizons. The pH in the surface mineral horizons ranges from 4.0 to 6.3 and that of the C horizon from 4.8 to 6.2 (21). Optimum range of pH for seedlings is 4.5 to 5.0. Western hemlock is highly productive on soils with a broad range of available nutrients. Evidence from various locations on the Pacific coast suggests that the productivity of western hemlock increases as soil nitrogen increases (15,21). There is no evidence that seedlings prefer ammonium over nitrate ions (32). Phosphorus may be limiting on some sites as suggested by data from Oregon showing a strong relation between site index and soil phosphorus (21). Although the requirement of western hemlock for cations is unclear, rooting habit and field data suggest that it requires or tolerates considerable amounts of calcium. The range in elevation at which western hemlock grows is broad, from sea level to 2130 m (7,000 ft); its distribution varies by latitude and mountain range. On the coast, western hemlock develops best between sea level and 610 m (2,000 ft); in the Rocky Mountains, between 490 and 1280 m (1,600 and 4,200 ft) (26).",Soils and Topography,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,15,1
"The forest industry recognizes western hemlock as an all-purpose raw material. It treats well and is used for pilings, poles, and railway ties. Strength and nailing characteristics make it a preferred species for construction lumber in North America and overseas. Better lumber grades are used for appearance and remanufacture products. Western hemlock has good-to-excellent pulping characteristics and is an important fiber source for groundwood, thermomechanical, kraft, and sulfite pulps.",Special Uses,Western Hemlock,tsuga,heterophylla,conifer,16,1
"Western juniper is a single species overstory in many northern stands. In ecotones or transitions, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and curlleaf mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) are the most common tree associates at the lower edge of the conifer zone (5,6). At upper elevations, western juniper often grows in narrow ecotones where deep, forested soils grade into shallow, rocky scab flats. Small stands or groups of trees commonly grow where rock outcrops produce shallow soil inclusions in ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and other forest types (5,6,11). In the Sierra Nevada, western juniper may be found on shallow soils with Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), California red fir (Abies magnifica), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), or lodgepole pine (24). At the southern extension of its range in San Bernardino County, it generally grows at a higher elevation than California juniper (Juniperus californica) and Utah juniper (J. osteosperma) (20). This is the only documented area where western juniper and singleleaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla) grow together in a pinyon-juniper woodland vegetation type, although distributions are known to overlap geographically near the west edge of Nevada and from east-central to southern California (10,13). Western juniper is the associate of singleleaf pinyon only in the high altitude section of the type, primarily near Big Bear Lake, CA (13). Western juniper is recognized in five forest cover types (9). It is the dominant species in Western Juniper (Society of American Foresters Type 238); an associate species in Interior Ponderosa Pine (Type 237) and Jeffrey Pine (Type 247); and a minor or occasional species in Blue Oak-Digger Pine (Type 250) and California Mixed Subalpine (Type 256). Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is the most common shrub species associated with western juniper throughout its range. Other shrubs common to western juniper communities in the northern portion of its range are gray rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), green rabbitbrush (C. viscidiflorus), antelope-brush (Purshia tridentata), wax currant (Ribes cereum), and horsebrush (Tetradymia spp.). Less common shrubs are low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula), stiff sagebrush (A. rigida), spiny hopsage (Atriplex spinosa), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), prickly phlox (Leptodactylon pungens), and desert gooseberry (Ribes velutinum) (2,5,8). Common grass or grasslike species in northern areas are bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), prairie Junegrass (Koeleria cristata), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii), bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and Thurber needlegrass (Stipa thurberiana). Less common are threadleaf sedge (Carex filifolia), Ross sedge (C. rossii), sixweeks fescue (Festuca octoflora), needle-and-thread (Stipa comata), and western needlegrass (S. occidentalis). Forb species common to northern communities include western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), milkvetch (Astragalus spp.), littleflower collinsia (Collinsia parviflora), obscure cryptantha (Cryptantha ambigua), lineleaf fleabane (Erigeron linearis), woolly eriophyllum (Eriophyllum lanatum), spreading groundsmoke (Gayophytum diffusum), lupine (Lupinus spp.), a suffrutescent wild buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), and tufted phlox (Phlox caespitosa). Less common associates are sulfur eriogonum (Eriogonum umbellatum), small bluebells (Mertensia longiflora), and Hooker silene (Silene hookeri) (2,5,8). Major western juniper associations in central Oregon include Juniperus/Artemisia/Festuca, Juniperus/Artemisia/Festuca-Lupinus, Juniperus/ Festuca, Juniperus/Artemisia/Agropyron-Chaenactis, Juniperus/ Artemisia/Agropyron, Juniperus/Artemisia/Agropyron-Astragalus, Juniperus/Artemisia-Purshia, Juniperus/Agropyron, and Juniperus/ Agropyron-Festuca (8). In one treatment of vegetation types in the conterminous United States, western juniper is considered the dominant species in the Juniper Steppe Woodland (Juniperus-Artemisia-Agropyron), number 24, and is a secondary species in the Juniper-Pinyon Woodland (Juniperus-Pinus), number 23 (8,10,17).",Associated Forest Cover,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,1,1
"Northern populations of western juniper grow in a climate characterized as continental. The climate is semiarid with typical intermountain characteristics of dry hot summers, cold winters, and precipitation of 230 to 355 mm (9 to 14 in), which occurs principally as snow during the winter and as rain in the spring and fall (5). Precipitation is generally sparse in the summer. Frost can occur during any month in central Oregon, the area of western juniper's most extensive stands; however, July and August are generally frost free. Temperatures in central Oregon range from a record low of -32° C (-26° F) during January to a record high of 41° C (105° F) during August. The average temperature in January is -1° C (30° F) and in July, 18° C (64° F). Southern populations of western juniper grow in a similar climate; however, winter temperatures are less extreme than in northern areas. Summer lightning storms are common in the western juniper zone and result in natural fires which have historically had a major influence on distribution and past occurrence of juniper. Although western juniper grows in extensive stands in a narrow range of precipitation (230 to 355 mm; 9 to 14 in) in central Oregon, it is a minor species in many upper elevation areas of higher precipitation. The latter areas have shallow, rocky soils too droughty to support other more common upper-slope conifers.",Climate,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,2,1
"Two subspecies of western juniper have been identified, Juniperus occidentalis ssp. occidentalis and ssp. australis. Distribution of the former is in south-central and southeastern Washington, eastern Oregon, southwestern Idaho, northeastern California, and the northwestern corner of Nevada; that of the latter is near Susanville in Lassen County, CA, south to San Bernardino County, CA (4,10,20,23,26). The only other divergence reported is a variant that has a narrow spirelike habit and occurs in a very restricted location in central Oregon (24). Western juniper may be hybridizing with Utah juniper where the two species grow together in northwestern Nevada east of California's Warner Mountains. Two relict individuals in the White Mountains of California may be hybrids of western juniper and Utah juniper (26).",Genetics,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,7,1
"Western juniper is found intermittently from latitude 34° N. in California to latitude 46° 37' N. in southeastern Washington, in a narrow belt from longitude 117° W. in Idaho and California to longitude 123° W. in northern California, and in sparse, scattered stands in south-central and southeastern Washington, southeastern Oregon, and the northwest corner of Nevada. In southwestern Idaho, it grows on approximately 162 000 ha (400,000 acres) (2). Western juniper reaches its greatest abundance as extensive and continuous stands in central Oregon. Stands more limited in size extend up the valleys and foothills of the southern Blue Mountain region, and small groups or individuals are scattered sparsely through the northern Blue Mountains. Extensive stands are common on the plains and in the foothills of north-central Oregon, and large stands occur down the high plains and foothills of south-central Oregon (5,6). From north-central through south-central Oregon, western juniper grows in various densities on roughly 1 140 000 ha (2,816,000 acres) (5). It is found near Mount Ashland in southwestern Oregon (10), the only native stand documented west of the Cascade Range in Oregon. It grows in scattered locations west of the Cascades in northern California and extends south to Trinity County. Western juniper is present in extensive stands from the Oregon border south through the Pit River Valley in northeastern California and continues intermittently as sparse stands in a narrow corridor along eastern California south to disjunct stands in the San Bernardino Mountains (17). The eastern limits of this species are in San Bernardino County, CA, and Owyhee County, ID. The western limit is Trinity County, CA. - The native range of western juniper.",Native Range,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- The northern Juniperus occidentalis ssp. occidentalis is submonoecious; the southern subspecies australis is dioecious. In Oregon and Washington, western juniper flowers in spring and sheds pollen in May. Yellowish-brown staminate cones are terminal, ovoid, and 3 to 4 mm (0. 12 to 0. 16 in) long. They have 12 to 15 microsporophylls. Ovulate cones are 6 to 8 mm. (0.24 to 0.31 in) long, subglobose to ellipsoid, bluish-black when mature, and very glaucous. Ovulate cones, referred to as berries, have resinous pulp and mature in September of the second season in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Ovulate cones commonly have two to three developed seeds, rarely one. The seed has a thick, bony outer coat and a thin, membranous inner coat. The membranous coat surrounds a fleshy endosperm within which a straight embryo with cotyledons occurs (4,14,24,26). Seed Production and Dissemination- Good seed production in western juniper occurs nearly every year. Seed yield from 45 kg (100 lb) of fruit averages 9 kg (20 lb). Cleaned seeds average 27 000/kg (12,300/lb) and range from 17 600 to 35 000/kg (8,000 to 15,860/lb) (14). Seeds are disseminated during the fall, primarily by birds and mammals. Animals ingest the fruit but do not digest the seeds. Dissemination of seeds by animals is evidenced by seed-filled droppings, particularly from robins and coyotes. Western juniper is often found growing along fence rows, seeds having been deposited there by perched birds (14,19,24). Fruit can be collected after it has fallen from the tree or by handpicking it from the tree. Care must be taken when collecting fruit directly from the tree because the new, unripe crop and the 2-year-old, ripe crop are mixed. Fruit should be collected as soon after ripening as possible to prevent removal by animals. It should be stored in shallow trays or piles to prevent excessive heating until seeds are extracted. Seeds of western juniper may be extracted from fruit by use of a macerator or hammermill in conjunction with water. Because of its resinous nature, pulp is more easily removed from the seeds if berries are presoaked in a lye solution consisting of 1.25 grams of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide per liter (1 teaspoon to 1 gallon) of water for 1 to 2 days. After they are cleaned, seeds should be washed to remove the lye and then stored dry in sealed containers at -2° to 4° C (29° to 40° F) and with a moisture content of approximately 10 percent (14). Seedling Development- Natural germination of western juniper occurs during April in Oregon. Germination is epigeal. How long after fruit ripening germination occurs and what dormancy characteristics are present are not known. Seeds of many juniper species show delayed germination because of dormant embryos or hard seed coats. Seeds of western juniper are thought to have both these characteristics. Stratification of seeds should be conducted in a sand or peat medium. A warm stratification is suggested for western juniper, fluctuating from 20° C (68° F) at night to 27° C (81° F) during the day for 45 to 90 days, and then cold stratification of approximately 4° C (39° F) to induce germination (14). After stratification, seeds can be sown in the fall or spring. For spring planting, seeds should be sown before air temperatures reach 21° C (70° F). Bare mineral soil seedbeds are reported as best for successful germination of seed and establishment of seedlings (24). Young plants are normally vigorous, single stemmed, and have pyramidal forms. Western juniper is very hardy in the early growth stage, resists disease and insect attacks well, and is not preferred as a food item by domestic or wild animals. Considerable browsing, however, occurs on deer winter ranges when other forage is limited; heavy use results in a hedged growth form. Vegetative Reproduction- Planting stock has been successfully grafted and cuttings have been successfully rooted in experimental trials. Some stock has been developed by layering (24).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- In the sapling and pole stages, western juniper has straight holes, and the crown varies from medium tapered to round. Early growth rate varies by site; however, growth throughout its range is poor, relative to most conifer species. Height of mature trees ranges from 4 to 10 in (13 to 33 ft), with exceptions at both ends of the spectrum, depending on site conditions. Occasionally, trees reach exceptional heights, such as one recorded as 26.5 in (87 ft) tall and 396 cm (156 in) in d.b.h.; and another, 26.5 in (87 ft) tall and 414 cm (163 in) in d.b.h. (4,21). Boles of mature trees are massive and more tapered than those of many conifer species, and the butt section is often slightly fluted. This species commonly develops full crowns and heavy limbs at maturity and, in the overmature stage, has a ragged, dead-topped, gnarled appearance. Western juniper is a long-lived and ruggedly picturesque species, reaching ages estimated to be more than 1,000 years (24). Old-growth stands in central Oregon are between 200 and 400 years old. Rooting Habit- Seedlings of western juniper, typical of and site species, produce rapid spring root extension with minimal top growth. There is a greater downward growth than lateral growth of roots, again characteristic of and site species. As seedlings become established, their roots extend laterally to take maximum advantage of nutrients and seasonal moisture in upper soil horizons. As a mature tree, western juniper lacks a central taproot. It has roots that are wide spreading and strong, often penetrating deep into cracks of bedrock. Reaction to Competition- Western juniper is intolerant of shade and competes poorly with conifers on upper slope sites. Although many individual specimens are found growing as seedlings or saplings in upper slope conifer communities with moderate to dense crowns, they are usually small and suppressed and have low vigor. Establishment of western juniper in this situation apparently occurs when the stand is opened by disturbance. Western juniper is intolerant of fire and historically was kept in restricted sites by natural fires. Since the advent of effective fire control and intensive livestock grazing (reducing ground fuel and understory competition), regeneration and establishment of western juniper have expanded into suitable sites previously dominated by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana). This expansion of young stands is common in Oregon, Idaho, and northeastern California (2,3,5,6). Damaging Agents- Because of the characteristic wide spacing in most stands, the short stature of the trees, and the extensive, strong root systems that often penetrate cracked rock under the soil mantle, western juniper is very resistant to wind. Most damage from wind occurs as top breakage in mature and overmature trees, and little damage occurs in young stands. Fire resistance varies with age. Seedlings, saplings, and poles are highly vulnerable to fire (18). Mature trees have some resistance to fire because they have little fuel near the stem and relatively thick bark, and because foliage is fairly high above the ground. Old-growth stands remain in existence because, historically, intense natural fires have not occurred and human-caused fires have been controlled (2,3,5,6). Because of effective fire controls, young stands are expanding into shrublands that would otherwise be maintained by periodic natural fires (2). Where desired, it is easiest to control or eliminate western juniper on rangelands with fire management when trees are less than 2 m (6 ft) tall. The taller the trees become, the more intense the fire must be to obtain good control. If a site has developed a dense stand of large trees, fuel consisting of shrubs and bunchgrass is often inadequate for burning trees under any weather conditions that management can safely tolerate (18). Because the species has relatively little commercial value, little attention has been given to the identification or effect of insects that attack western juniper. Serious damage in western juniper by insects is infrequent. The juniper bark beetle (Phloeosinus serratus) can cause mortality, particularly to trees in a weakened condition, during a drought (24). Gall midges feed on western juniper and produce galls; however, their effect on productivity has not been studied. Although termites are not considered a problem in use of products made from western juniper wood, an unidentified species of termite has been observed in dead material on lower portions of overmature trees, as well as in juniper fenceposts in central Oregon. The principal damaging agents to western juniper are a white trunk rot (Pyrofomes demidoffii) that attacks living trees and an unidentified brown cubicle rot usually found in the basal portions of the trunk (24). These rots cause high losses and have prevented the use of western juniper wood for pencils. A single sporophore in evidence usually indicates a tree is unmerchantable. The endophytic fungi Retinocyclus abietis anamorpha and Hormoneme sp. have been found on the foliage of western juniper. Infection rates increase with age, density, and purity of stands. In general, western juniper is minimally susceptible to infection (22). Two mistletoes, identified as constricted mistletoe (Phoradendron ligatum) and dense mistletoe (P. densom), cause lower vigor, deformity of branches, and brooming of the foliage (12). A third mistletoe, R. juniperinum (Viscaceae), also occurs on western juniper (25). Brooming of foliage is also caused by the stem rusts Gymnosporangium kernianum and G. betheli. One other rust of the same genus has been reported (12). Except for the white trunk rot and the unidentified brown one, none of the diseases that attack western juniper has been assessed.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,14,1
"Western juniper grows on soils developed in parent materials originating from metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous sources. Included are tuff, welded tuff, pumice, volcanic ash, rhyolite, andesite, granite, basalt, and eolian soils, and colluvial or alluvial mixtures of these soils. Western juniper forms complex patterns on zonal, intrazonal, and azonal soils. Profile development is often weak. Soils are generally stony but can be nearly free of stones. They are commonly shallow (25 to 38 cm; 10 to 15 in) but range to deep (more than 122 cm or 48 in). Fractured bedrock or broken indurated subsoil layers commonly occur under shallow overburdened soils. Surface horizons are often of medium texture, and subsoils of medium to fine texture; however, textures can vary from sandy to clayey. Indurated layers can occur and are associated with accumulations of clay, calcium carbonate, and silica. They may be less than 1.5 cm (0.6 in) to several centimeters thick (5,6,8). Under mature western juniper trees in central Oregon, soil Ca, K, and pH are higher than in inter-space soils and soils under young trees. These changes appear to increase the ability of western juniper to compete with other vegetation (7). Soils supporting juniper at high densities are frequently Mollisols. Argixerolls, Haploxerolls, and Haplaquolls are common great groups. Soils supporting scattered juniper are commonly Aridisols-including Camborthids, Durargids, and Haplargids however, Argixerolls are also common. Other soils on which western juniper can be found are Durixerolls and Cryoborolls of the order Mollisols, Torriorthents of the order Entisols, and Chromoxererts of the order Vertisols (5,6). Western juniper is found on all exposures and slopes. In central Oregon, it is common in large continuous stands on level to gentle topography. In other areas, it grows less continuously on terraces, moderately sloping alluvial fans, canyon slopes, and steep, rocky escarpments (5,6,8). Elevations at which western juniper is found range from about 185 m (600 ft) along the Columbia River to more than 3050 m (10,000 ft) in the Sierra Nevada (24). In central Oregon, there are large, continuous stands between 670 and 1525 m (2,200 and 5,000 ft) (8).",Soils and Topography,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,15,1
"Western juniper has had no widespread commercial value. During the pioneer era, it was important as firewood and as poles for fences, corrals, and simple shelters. Locally, it is still important for many of the same uses (5). Heartwood is extremely durable and far outlasts other local materials in northern areas when placed in contact with the ground. It probably equals durability of other junipers and of cedars in more southern areas. Western juniper logs are difficult to process. They are rough, limby, short, and have rapid taper. They also have bark inclusions deep in the wood. Juniper is reputed to be difficult to cure because it twists and warps while drying, and to be difficult to plane, splitting easily. The reputation is undeserved-local specialty manufacturers have been air-drying this wood successfully for many years (12). Thin boards can be kiln-dried successfully without checking. In fact, any slow drying process works well. Local manufacturers use western juniper for making furniture, novelty items, toys, tongue-and-groove interior paneling, fenceposts, and firewood. Products experimentally manufactured that are considered commercially feasible include hardboard, particle board, veneer, and exposed and decorative interior studs. Research in extracted essential oils indicates that cedrol, used in scenting and flavoring, could be extracted in quantities and would be of a quality to be commercially competitive with cedrol from other juniper species (1,12). Western juniper is valuable for wildlife cover, food (primarily berries), and nest sites, and as shade for livestock (16,19). Also, management agencies use harvested trees as riprap for stabilizing streambanks. Natural stands in developing areas are highly valuable for landscaping homesites, but the species has not been popular for horticultural uses.",Special Uses,Western Juniper,juniperus,occidentalis,conifer,16,1
"Western larch is a long-lived seral species that always grows with other tree species. Young stands sometimes appear to be pure, but other species are in the understory, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) is its most common tree associate. Other common tree associates include: ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) on the lower, drier sites; grand fir (Abies grandis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and western white pine (Pinus monticola) on moist sites; and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) in the cool-moist subalpine forests (44). Western larch makes up a majority or plurality in the forest cover type Western Larch (Society of American Foresters Type 212) (43). It is included in 11 other cover types: 205 Mountain Hemlock 206 Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir 210 Interior Douglas-Fir 213 Grand Fir 215 Western White Pine 218 Lodgepole Pine 220 Rocky Mountain Juniper 224 Western Hemlock 227 Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock 228 Western Redcedar 237 Interior Ponderosa Pine Classification systems based on potential natural vegetation have been developed for much of the geographic area where western larch grows. Larch is a seral species in 13 of the 21 habitat types described for eastern Washington and northern Idaho (7). In Montana, larch is a significant component in 20 of the 64 forest habitat types (21). Of these 20 habitat types, larch is a major seral species in 12, and a minor seral species in 8. These habitat types are found within the following forest series: the relatively dry-warm Douglas-fir; the moist grand fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock; and the cold-moist subalpine fir. Larch forests typically have a rich understory flora with dense herbaceous and less dense shrub layers. It is not unusual to find as many as 7 tree species and 40 undergrowth species in plots of 405 m² (4,356 ft²) (21). On a 40-ha (100-acre) study area on the Coram Experimental Forest in northwestern Montana, 10 conifer, 21 shrub, and 58 herbaceous species were recorded (31). Some of the common understory species associated with larch are the following: Shrubs Herbs",Associated Forest Cover,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,1,1
"Western larch grows in a relatively moist-cool climatic zone, with low temperature limiting its upper elevational range and deficient moistures its lower extremes (44). Mean annual temperature within the larch zone is about 7° C (45° F), but annual maximums average 29° C (84° F) and minimums average -9° C (15° F) (table 1) (35). Average temperatures during the May through August growing season are about 16° C (60° F) with July the warmest month. The frost-free season varies from about 60 to 160 days, usually from early June through early September. Frosts can occur any month of the year. Annual precipitation in larch forests averages about 710 mm (28 in) in the north part of its range to 810 mm (32 in) in the south. The extremes where larch grows are about 460 mm (18 in) and 1270 mm (50 in). About one-fifth of the annual precipitation occurs during the May through August growing season, most of it in May and June. July and August are usually dry and are characterized by clear, sunny days (60 to 80 percent of the daylight hours), low humidity, and high evaporation rates (44). Elevation and geographic location affect both the amount and the form of precipitation. On midelevation sites, snow commonly blankets most larch forests from November to late April and accounts for over half the total precipitation. Snow accounts for an even higher proportion of the total precipitation in the northerly higher elevation Portions of larch forests. One high elevation larch site at Roland, ID, receives an average of 620 cm (244 in) of snow annually. Lower elevation sites commonly receive an average of more than 150 cm (60 in) of snow.",Climate,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,2,1
"Races of western larch are not known. Putative natural hybridization of western larch and subalpine larch (Larix lyallii) occasionally occurs in areas where their distributions overlap (4). Even where the geographic ranges of the, two species overlap, usually elevations of 300 m (1,000 ft) or more separate them. Interspecific hybrids of western larch and Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis) were taller and more vigorous than open-pollinated western larch progenies at the end of the first and second growing seasons (48).",Hybrids,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,9,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- Western larch is monoecious; both staminate and ovulate flowers develop throughout the crown. Buds are found at the end of short spurlike lateral branchlets. Vegetative buds are smaller than flower buds-usually about 2.5 to 3.0 mm (0.10 to 0.12 in) in diameter, whereas flower buds range from about 3.0 to 4.8 mm (0.12 to 0. 19 in) in diameter. Ovulate buds are one to one and one-half times longer than they are wide and are rounded or conical on the end. Staminate buds are usually globose and about one and one-half to two times longer than wide. Vegetative and flower buds can be detected early in the fall, about 1 year before subsequent cone crops mature. Methods of sampling buds and conelets have been devised for forecasting larch seed crops on individual trees, as well as stands (24). Pollen and seed conelets appear several days before vegetative buds open-usually from about April 15 to May 15 (44). Conelets are generally very conspicuous, varying from bright red to green. Pollination occurs in late May and early June (33). Cones complete their development in one season and mature by mid- to late-August, reaching 2.5 to 4.5 cm (1.0 to 1.8 in) in length. Cones usually begin to open by early September, but in cool-moist summers cone opening may be delayed a month or longer. More than 80 percent of the seeds usually are dispersed by mid-October (44). Cones open when they have dried to a moisture content of 35 to 40 percent, opening at the same time on individual trees, but varying substantially among trees in the same stand (39). Cones usually fall from the tree during the following winter, but many may stay attached through the next summer. Seed Production and Dissemination- Larch is a good seed producer, but cone crops vary substantially by year and location. Long-term records of larch seed production in Montana show that good seed crops are produced at about 5-year intervals with fair to poor crops in the intervening years (44). Two good crops or several poor crops, however, may occur in close succession. Overall, the ratio of good or fair to poor seed crops is about 1 to 1. Cone production is infrequent on larch trees less than 25 years old, although trees as young as 8 years occasionally produce cones. Larch starts bearing abundant cone crops from 40 to 50 years and continues bearing heavily for 300 to 500 years (35). Only dominants and codominants produce significant numbers of cones (44). Cone production usually is a function of crown size because larch bears cones throughout the crown. Trees with the largest crowns produce the most cones. During a good cone year, production ranged from a low of 56 cones in one tree with 45 major branches to a high of 2,090 cones in another tree with 95 major branches. Also, vigorous, full-crowned, mature trees averaging 56 cm (22 in) in diameter produced about five times as many seeds as 36-cm (14-in) trees in the same stand and age class (44). A mature cone may have as many as 80 filled seeds per cone, but the average is about half that number (39). Seed viability is related to cone-crop size, ranging from a low of 5 to 10 percent viability in poor crops to 70 to 80 percent in good crops. Young trees usually produce seeds of higher viability than overmature trees. Larch seeds are small and lightweight, averaging 302,000/kg (137,000/lb) (45). Because of their relatively large wing, they are dispersed to greater distances than the heavier seeds of Douglas-fir and subalpine fir, but to about the same distance as the light seed of Engelmann spruce (37). Larch seed may be dispersed 240 m (787 ft) from clearcut boundaries under normal wind conditions (fig 1). Although the seeds traveling that distance are only about 5 percent of that falling within the timber, they may amount to 100,000/ha (40,000/acre) in a heavy seed year-more than is adequate to restock favorable seedbeds. Overstocking often occurs near the seed source when bare soil is exposed. Seeds are disseminated more uniformly in seed tree and shelterwood cuttings than in clearcuts. Figure 1- Dispersal characteristics of sound western larch seed from a seed source along a clearcut boundary. Seed production in mature natural stands of larch may exceed 1.2 million seeds per hectare (0.5 million seeds/acre) in a heavy seed crop. Records at Coram. Experimental Forest indicate that small rodents eat only about 1 to 3 percent of the seeds during the overwintering period (41). In contrast, rodents usually feed heavily on the larger seeds of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine during this same period. Larch seed germinates about the time of snowmelt from late April to early June, usually 1 to 2 weeks before associated tree species (38). Germination is epigeal (45). Natural stratification of larch seeds during the winter prompts rapid and complete germination. Without stratification, spring-sown larch seeds germinate slowly and erratically, with some seeds holding over until the next season. Artificial stratification methods using cold-moist conditions work well for preparing seed for field germination. These same seed treatments, as well as those using stimulants, such as hydrogen peroxide, are particularly useful for testing germinative energy and capacity (26). Air temperatures of about 27° C (80° F) are ideal for larch seed germination, but seeds germinate at temperatures 10° to 15° C (17° to 27° F) cooler than that. Seedling Development- Western larch is a seral species well adapted to seedbeds exposed by burning (9) or mechanical scarification (35,40). Seedbeds of undisturbed litter, humus, sod, and areas with heavy root competition are poor for larch seedling survival. Most seedling losses occur the first growing season- after 3 years seedling losses are minor (35). For example, studies on areas favorable for larch show that 54 percent of the seedlings survived the first season; 85 percent of the remaining seedlings survived the second season; and by the fifth season the remaining seedlings survival was 94 percent. In other studies, an average of 39 percent of the larch seedlings survived the first 3 years (44). Seedling survival is affected mostly by biotic factors early in the growing season and by physical factors late in the season. Until about mid-July mortality is caused primarily by fungi, rodents, birds, and insects. Most losses of first-year seedlings, particularly those growing on duff, are caused by fungi, usually immediately after germination. Seedlings growing on mineral soil seedbeds are far less susceptible to fungi than their counterparts growing on duff under both full sun and partial shade. Under full shade, however, susceptibility on the two types of seedbed is reversed (44). Seedling losses to animals, insects, and birds are relatively minor overall but may be heavy in specific locations and years. Insolation is the most important physical factor affecting larch seedling survival (38). High soil surface temperatures exceeding 57° C (135° F) are not uncommon starting in late June, resulting in heat girdling of seedlings at the soil-air interface. Again, duff is the least desirable seedbed, with lethal temperatures occurring earlier in the season and on more days. Lethal soil temperatures are reached most frequently on duff, less on burned mineral soil, and least on scarified mineral soil. On south and west slopes, soil surface temperatures exceed 79° C (175° F), and few larch seedlings survive regardless of the type of seedbed (38). Drought is the major physical factor affecting mid-to late-season seedling survival. Unlike insolation, drought losses are heaviest in full shade because of the heavy competition for moisture by all the associated tree and understory vegetation. Although aspect affects germination very little, it has a pronounced effect on seedling survival. North, northwest, and northeast exposures and gentle to flat topography provide the most favorable conditions for larch seedling survival. High surface temperatures and droughty conditions on the south and west exposures preclude survival of any significant number of larch seedlings. As a result, larch is either absent or but a minor stand component on hot, dry slopes. Larch seedlings grow about 5 cm (2 in) the first growing season. In shade, root penetration may average only 2.5 cm (1 in) the first year, while its counterparts growing in the sun or partial shade may have 23 cm (9 in) roots. Seedlings growing in partial shade usually grow faster in height than seedlings in full sunlight for the first few years, but faster in full sunlight after that. Larch seedlings break dormancy very easily. Buds usually burst by late April, well before those of any other native conifers. Shoot growth starts from late May to mid-June. Larch seedlings grow rapidly in spite of the relatively short growing season of the Northern Rockies. Average annual height growth of about 30 cm (12 in) for the first 4 years is common (44). Of its major associates only lodgepole pine matches the rapid juvenile height growth of western larch. Douglas-fir seedlings grow at about one-half the rate of larch, and Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir seedlings grow at about one-fourth the rate of larch (28). Vegetative Reproduction- Larch does not reproduce by sprouts. Cuttings have been successfully rooted by researchers at the Intermountain Forest and Range Experiment Station, but methods have not been fully tested at this time. One technique requires cutting 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) scions from young larch trees, dipping the lower portion of the cutting in a powder mixture of 0.8 percent indolebutyric acid and 10.0 percent Captan 50 wettable powder (mixed with talc), and placing them in a rooting chamber at about 24° C (75° F). Researchers at the Intermountain Station have successfully grafted western larch.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Western larch is long-lived and is the largest of the world larches (20). Trees exceeding 230 cm (90 in) d.b.h. and 900 years of age have been found (44). Larch normally reaches 30 to 55 m (100 to 180 ft) in height at maturity and occasionally exceeds 61 m (200 ft). Larch grows faster in height than any other conifer in the Northern Rockies for the first century, giving this highly shade-intolerant species the height advantage it needs to survive. For the first 50 years, larch and lodgepole pine height growth are similar, but thereafter lodgepole height growth declines in comparison with larch. Differences in height growth of larch and its associated species are readily apparent at early ages. Both larch and lodgepole pine start off faster than their associates. Studies on good quality sites on Coram Experimental Forest in Montana show larch and lodgepole pine growing at about twice the rate of Douglas-fir and three to four times faster than subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce for the first 20 years. On wetter sites in northern Idaho, larch and lodgepole pine typically grow much faster than western white pine, western hemlock, and western redcedar in unthinned natural stands for the first half century. In thinned stands, however, differences in height growth of western white pine and larch are nominal. By age 100, the height growth advantage larch holds over its associates typically becomes less pronounced (35,10). Site productivity accounts for the largest share of the variation in height growth of larch throughout its range. Site index curves for larch (base age of 50) show heights at age 100 ranging from 20 m (65 ft) on low sites to 40 m (130 ft) on high sites (table 2). Average site indices for larch on different ecological habitat types are given in table 3. Physiographic position, directly interrelated with habitat type, also influences height growth. Larch grows most rapidly in height on the deep, moist soils of valley bottoms and lower north and east slopes, but poorly on the upper south and upper west slopes (35): Seedbed conditions at the time of seedling establishment influence height growth in the formative years (27). Studies on Priest River Experimental Forest in northern Idaho showed that on the average 2-year-old larch seedlings were twice as tall on burned seedbeds as they were on bare mineral or duff-covered soil (14). Subsequent studies on Coram Experimental Forest showed that these height growth differences persisted into the teenage years, with larch growing about one-third faster on burned seedbeds than on scarified or undisturbed seedbeds (35). These differences may be due to changes in nutrient availability, water infiltration into the soil, or competing vegetation. Microchemical tests showed increased levels of manganese, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium in the upper soil layers of burned seedbeds (14). Stand density also affects height growth very early in the life of the stand (27). Heavy overstocking is common in young stands with densities sometimes exceeding 86,500 trees per hectare (35,000/acre). In a 9-year-old stand at Coram Experimental Forest for example, dominant larch were growing a third faster in height in stands with 12,400 trees per hectare (5,000/acre) than they were in stands with 86,500/ha (35,000/acre). Thinning these overstocked stands relieved this height growth suppression, but even the dominant trees in unthinned stands continued to grow well below their potential in height (30). By age 24, dominant trees in the thinned stands averaged more than 9 m (30 ft) tall, but their counterparts in the unthinned stands averaged 15 to 20 percent less (29). Diameter growth measured at breast height (1.37 m or 4.5 ft) for larch largely parallels height growth and is affected by many of the same factors. Larch has the potential for rapid diameter growth, but overstocking, insects, and dwarf mistletoe often prevent full realization of this potential. Potential diameter growth curves have been developed for western larch on different combinations of habitat type and site index to provide a basis for evaluating tree and stand conditions (table 4) (35). These projections, based on relatively open trees, show larch at, age 50, reaching diameters ranging from a high of 26 cm (10.3 in) on high to 14 cm (5.4 in) on low quality sites; at age 100, 45 cm (17.8 in) to 25 cm (9.9 in). Larch diameter growth is very sensitive to stand density. For example, in 9-year-old stands on Coram Experimental Forest, overstocking of 86,500 trees per hectare (35,000/acre) had already restricted diameter growth of the dominant trees to half that of their counterparts in stands with 12,400/ha (5,000/acre) (27). At age 19 and 24, dominant trees in these unthinned stands (with about 37,100/ha or 15,000/acre) continued growing at about half the rate of their counterparts in thinned stands (with about 1,000 trees per hectare or 400/acre). For example, at age 24, dominant trees in thinned stands averaged nearly 13 cm (5 in) compared to about 8 cm (3 in) for dominants in unthinned stands (29). Elsewhere, 30- to 50-year-old stands in Montana showed about the same diameter relationships, with crop-trees in unthinned stands growing at about half their potential (25). Basal area increases rapidly to about age 40 years, decelerates, and nearly levels off after age 100. At age 100, basal area of larch forests approaches 69 m²/ha (300 ft²/acre) on high quality sites and about 46 m²/ha (200 ft²/acre) on low quality sites. On high sites, the average annual increase in basal area is about 0.7 m²/ha (3 ft²/acre) for the first century. Average increase during the 100- to 200-year period is only about one-tenth the rate noted in the first 100 years. As basal area stocking approaches site potential, increment drops off rapidly-the site is fully occupied. Larch forests can produce heavy timber volumes. The increase in volume follows a similar pattern as basal area but peaks later. Because of their influence on diameter and height growth, site quality, age, and stocking level play the major roles in volume yield. Projected cubic yields for larch forests at age 100 range from 308 m³/ha (4,407 ft³/acre) on low quality to 813 m³/ha (11,608 ft³/acre) on high quality sites (table 5). With full stocking (but not overstocked), 544 m³/ha (7,765 ft³/acre) is a reasonable objective by age 100 on medium quality sites for larch forests. Rooting Habit- Larch develops a deep and extensive root system, but little information is available about its root growth. Root lengths on first-year natural seedlings usually reach 5 cm (2 in). Under good nursery conditions, well-developed fibrous roots 20 cm (8 in) or longer develop on 1-0 growing stock. Observations in soils under young larch stands indicate extensive fibrous rooting in the top 50 cm (20 in), substantially less in the 50-100 cm (20-40 in) depths, and practically none at greater depths. Soil water depletion studies verify these observations in young larch stands (29). Heavy rooting at depths greater than the above has been observed along roadcuts through old-growth stands. Evaluations of roots of windfallen overmature larch show that nearly all of them were infected with root rots (35). Apparently, these rots play an important role in wind stability of overmature trees, but their importance in young trees is not known. Reaction to Competition- Larch is the most shade-intolerant conifer in the Northern Rockies. Only during the seedling stage can it tolerate partial shading. If larch is overtopped its crown rapidly deteriorates, and its vigor declines severely. Because of its intolerance to shade, larch grows in even-aged stands or age-classes. Its primary associates are usually the same age as larch but often give the appearance of being younger because they grow slower than larch and form the lower strata in the stand. As larch stands mature, however, shade-tolerant associates continue to establish and form younger understories. Fire is essential to the maintenance of western larch in natural forest stands. Most fires that occur on mountain slopes are usually small and of low or moderate intensity (8). Fire intensity, however, increases on steep slopes with heavy fuels, or on dry ridgetops. These fires thin stands, reduce fuels, rejuvenate undergrowth, and prepare seedbeds that promote mixed conifer stands with small pockets of regeneration dominated by seral species, particularly western larch. Intense fires often create definite even-aged stands. At Coram, multiple burns occurring at less than 50-year intervals favor lodgepole pine or shrub fields. Historically, within the mixed conifer/pinegrass communities of the Blue Mountains of Oregon, underburns occur at 10-year intervals and maintain western larch and other seral species in the stands (15). Here, all species, including western larch, often overstock and can stagnate unless periodic fires release some trees. Without fire, grand fir and Douglas-fir replace the seral species. Although larch normally remains in the dominant position, understory trees and other vegetation vigorously compete with larch for available water and nutrients. In one harvest-cutting study, diameter growth of residual mature seed trees after logging increased 67 percent over pre-logging growth (44). When all understory trees were also cut, the seed trees increased an additional 36 percent in diameter increment. Even-aged silviculture systems of shelterwoods, seed-tree cuttings, and clearcuts best fit the ecological requirements of larch forests. They provide an adequate seed source and the microsite conditions needed for establishing the new seedlings. They are also compatible with the site preparations of prescribed burning 'or scarification needed to reduce the duff layers and vegetative competition for the new seedlings. Prescribed burning most closely approximates the natural wildfires that historically have perpetuated larch forests. No detrimental impact on site quality has been attributed to harvesting or prescribed fire on the soil microflora (16). Conversely, uneven-aged silviculture systems have limited utility in most larch forests. Not only does the residual stand show little overall growth response after partial cuttings, the growth increases that do occur are mainly on the more tolerant and generally less desirable species, such as subalpine fir. In addition, partial cuttings discriminate strongly against larch and its shade-intolerant associates in the regeneration process, and larch becomes a minor stand component in stands it formerly dominated. Prescribed burning or scarification needed to regenerate larch are very difficult in partial cuttings. For management considerations other than timber production, such as esthetics or wildlife, there may be rationale for uneven-aged silviculture systems in some larch forests. Even here, however, it should be recognized that these practices violate the normal regeneration sequence in most of these forests, accelerate the succession to tolerant species, and increase insect and disease problems. Studies on Coram Experimental Forest have demonstrated many of the problems with single-tree selection cuttings. Even with special care, it is extremely difficult to use group-selection cuttings in old-growth larch forests. Exceptions to the above are possible in some of the drier phases of Douglas-fir and grand fir habitat types, particularly in the Blue Mountains of Oregon and some lower elevation areas of western Montana. Here, natural underburns at 20- to 30-year intervals perpetuated more open-grown stands and allowed the establishment of western larch and ponderosa pine regeneration under the main forest canopy (1,15). Uneven-aged silviculture systems that mimic these natural conditions are plausible in these types of larch forests. Thinning in young western larch stands, preferably before age 20, enhances the growth of diameter and height during the juvenile years when response potential is greatest. Drastic reduction in the densities found in most unthinned stands is advisable. Studies in young larch show that larch responds well in diameter, height, and crown retention under a fairly broad range of densities after thinning, usually exceeding what were thought to be maximum growth rates (30). Even at ages 30 to 50, larch responds well to release (25,36). By this age, however, overstocking has reduced the crown and response is usually delayed. Timing and extent of response is a function of length and severity of overstocking. Individual tree growth once lost can never be regained. Branch turnups following thinning can be a problem in young larch stands. If a tree is cut off above a live branch, it may turn up, reform the tree, and reduce the effectiveness of the thinning (35). Older larch sometimes produce sprouts from adventitious buds on the upper bole of the tree after thinning of older stands, but this effect may not have practical significance. The amount of sprouting increases with the severity of the thinning (25). Preliminary studies of fertilization in Montana (2) show a positive diameter growth response to fertilization with nitrogen, but the effects last only about 3 years. Similar studies in Idaho showed a short-term diameter growth response to nitrogen (13), but neither study showed any height increase. Damaging Agents- Mature larches are the most fire-resistant trees in the Northern Rockies because of their thick bark, their high and open branching habit, and the low flammability of their foliage. Poles are moderately resistant, but seedlings and saplings have very little resistance to fire (44). Larch is moderately to highly resistant to windthrow because of its extensive root system. Isolated old-growth seed trees or those along cutting boundaries, however, are susceptible to windthrow, particularly those on upper slopes and ridgetops, or those in narrow canyons and saddles where winds are channeled (35). Because larch is deciduous, its branches seldom accumulate excessive amounts of either snow or ice. Early fall or late spring snows occasionally catch larch with a full complement of needles and cause severe bending. After a heavy June snow on the Coram. Experimental Forest, young larch were completely flattened, but they recovered surprisingly well with little apparent long-term damage (34). Young larch is extremely sensitive to noxious fumes, but because it is deciduous, the tree accumulates fewer harmful deposits than other conifers. Fluorine and sulfur dioxide are both harmful, but fluorine is the more toxic. Fluorides at levels of 30 to 35 p/m produce toxic needle effects (5). Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium laricis) is the most damaging disease-causing parasite of larch. It can infect seedlings as young as 3 to 7 years old and continue throughout the life of the tree (49). In addition to killing tree tops, reducing seed viability, creating conditions suitable for entry of other diseases and insects, and causing burls, brashness, and some mortality, it decreases height and diameter growth. Basal area growth reductions can be expected as follows (22): light infection, 14 percent; medium infection, 41 percent; and heavy infection, 69 percent. Infected residual-stand overstories left after logging or fires promptly infect understory stands. Mistletoe seed can be ejected as far as 14 m (45 ft) (42). Thus 50 evenly-spaced, diseased trees per hectare (20/acre) may infest understory trees with just one crop of mistletoe seeds. Proper harvest-cutting systems, particularly clearcutting, can substantially reduce the mistletoe problem. Three other important diseases are found in larch: needlecast caused by Hypodermella laricis, the quinine fungus Fomitopsis officinalis, and red ring rot caused by Phellinus pini. Many other less common but potentially dangerous fungi, such as Encoeliopsis laricina, infect larch but have not caused significant problems in the past (35). Larch casebearer (Coleophora laricella) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) are currently the two most serious insect pests of western larch (35). Casebearer was first detected in the Northern Rockies in 1957 and since then has spread throughout virtually the entire larch forest type (11). Introduced and native parasites, plus adverse weather conditions on many larch sites, appear to be reducing the casebearer problem, however. Severe defoliation by the casebearer can substantially reduce tree growth, but mortality usually is low. Western spruce budworm has been a persistent problem wherever heavy populations of budworm overlap the range of larch (12). The most serious damage to larch is severance of the terminal leader, which results in an average loss of about 25 to 30 percent of the height growth for that year (32). Other insect species affecting larch include the larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii) and the larch bud moth (Zeiraphera improbana) that cause heavy, but sporadic, damage. The western larch sawfly (Anoplonyx occidens), the two-lined larch sawfly (Anoplonyx laricivorus), and the larch looper (Semiothisa sexmaculata incolorata) also damage larch from time to time. Bark beetles are not generally a serious problem for larch, but the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) occasionally attacks weakened trees. At times, the engraver beetle (Ips plastographus), the larch engraver (Scolytus laricis), and the false hemlock looper (Nepytia canosaria) damage larch. Damage from larger animals is relatively minor. Rodents, because of their seed- and seedling-eating habits, can greatly influence seedling establishment. Larch is apparently unpalatable to most big game species. In addition, most larch forests occur in areas of heavy snowpack not suitable for winter game range (35). Bears, however, can be a local problem. They strip the bark on the lower bole of the most vigorous trees in young sapling and pole-sized stands during the spring of the year and often kill the trees.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,14,1
"Western larch grows on a wide variety of soils. The most extensive soils have developed in glacial till or colluvium composed of materials derived from limestone, argillite, and quartzite bedrocks of the Precambrian belt geologic series. Larch also grows on soils developed in Recent and Tertiary alluvium and Pleistocene lake sediments. Most soils suitable for the growth of western larch are deep and well drained. Soils developed in glacial till, colluvium, and recent alluvium have nongravelly to gravelly loamy surfaces and gravelly to extremely gravelly loamy subsoils. Volcanic ash is often incorporated into the surface horizon. Soils developed in Tertiary sediments or Pleistocene lake sediments have silt loam surfaces and silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay subsoils. Most soils supporting the growth of western larch are classified in two orders of the soil taxonomy: Inceptisols and Alfisols. Occasionally western larch is found on soils of the order Spodosols, but Spodosols are not extensive within the range of western larch and generally occur above the upper elevational limits of the species. A majority of the soils supporting the growth of western larch are the Cryoboralf, Cryochrept, and Cryandept great groups. Mean annual soil temperature of the soils within the great groups is about 5° C (41° F) at 51 cm (20 in). At low elevations on southern or western exposures within the range of western larch, soil temperatures are warmer and soils supporting the growth of western larch are in the Eutroboralf and Eutrochrept great soil groups. Western larch grows best on the more moist Eutrochrepts or Eutroboralfs and the lower elevation (warmer) Cryochrepts and Cryoboralfs. It is commonly found growing on valley bottoms, benches, and north- and east-facing mountain slopes. South and west exposures are often too severe for larch seedling establishment, particularly on the drier sites found at larch's lower elevational limits and the southern portion of its range. On moist sites found in the mid-to northern-portion of its range and on mid- to high-elevation sites, larch grows on all exposures.",Soils and Topography,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,15,1
"Western larch forests are valued for their multiple resource values. The seasonal change in hue of larch's delicate foliage from light green in the spring and summer, to gold in the fall, enhances the beauty of these mountain forests. Because larch is an aggressive pioneer species, it quickly reforests areas denuded by natural or man-caused disturbances, providing protection for those important watersheds in the Columbia River Basin. Western larch is an important component of high water-yielding forests-areas where management can influence water yield through harvest cuttings (19) and young stand culture (29). Larch forests provide the ecological niches needed for a wide variety of birds and animals. Hole-nesting birds comprise about one-fourth of the bird species in these forests, and studies on Coram Experimental Forest show that broken-topped larch is a preferred site for the hole-nesters (18). Deer, elk, moose, and the black and grizzly bear are widespread and numerous throughout the range of larch. Larch timber is used extensively for lumber, fine veneer, long-straight utility poles, railroad ties, mine timbers, and pulpwood (35). Larch wood is strong and hard and contains about 4 to 23 percent arabinogalactan. It is the best domestic source of this water soluble gum used for offset lithography and in food, pharmaceutical, paint, ink, and other industries. Arabinogalactan has the consistency of honey and contains 16 percent volatile pinene and limonene (44). Timber harvesting practices in larch forests are now utilizing more of the woody biomass formerly left in the woods after logging. Studies in the last decade have aimed at characterizing this biomass and the environmental consequences of removing biomass from larch forests (46). Typically, large volumes of standing live and dead tree biomass are found in old-growth larch forests (3). For example, of the 512 m³/ha (7,318 ft³/acre) found on a larch study area on Coram Experimental Forest in western Montana, 55 percent was in standing green trees, 20 percent in standing dead, and 25 percent in down material. In addition to tree biomass, shrubs and herbs account for additional biomass (31). In terms of weight, the average total biomass was 325 t/ha (145 tons/acre) with the following distribution:",Special Uses,Western Larch,larix,occidentalis,conifer,16,1
"Pure stands of western redcedar cover some small areas, but it is usually associated with other tree species. Along the coast these include black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), western hemlock, mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), Sitka spruce, western white pine (Pinus monticola), lodgepole (shore) pine (P. contorta), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), Alaska-cedar (C. nootkatensis), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), Douglas-fir, grand fir, Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), red alder (Alnus rubra), Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), and Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Several of these species (black cottonwood, western hemlock, western white pine, Douglas-fir, grand fir, and Pacific yew) are also associated with western redcedar in the interior. Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), western larch (Larix occidentalis), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), white spruce (P. glauca), lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine are also associated with redcedar in the interior. Redcedar is a major component of two forest cover types (11): Western Redcedar (Society of American Foresters Type 228) and Western Redcedar-Western Hemlock (Type 227). It is a minor component of the following types: 210 Interior Douglas-Fir 212 Western Larch 213 Grand Fir 215 Western White Pine 218 Lodgepole Pine 221 Red Alder 222 Black Cottonwood-Willow 223 Sitka Spruce 224 Western Hemlock 225 Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce 226 Coastal True Fir 229 Pacific Douglas-Fir 230 Douglas-Fir-Western Hemlock 231 Port-Orford-Cedar 232 Redwood Some associated shrub species are listed in table 1. Several occur in both interior and coastal environments, but Rocky Mountain honeysuckle (Lonicera utahensis) and clematis (Clematis columbiana) are associated with redcedar only in the interior, whereas salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) and red huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium) are found only on the Pacific slope. Pacific rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum) is an abundant associate in coastal California, Oregon, and Washington, but it is rare and confined to isolated locations in south-coastal British Columbia. Salal (Gaultheria shallon) also is an abundant associate. Its range extends farther south than that of redcedar, but the northern limits of salal are nearly the same as the northern limits of western redcedar in coastal Alaska. Some associated herb species are listed in table 2. Many are common in both coastal and interior environments. However, slough sedge (Carex obnupta) and Pacific water-parsley (Oenanthe sarmentosa) are limited to moist habitats west of the Cascades, whereas wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis) and goldthread (Coptis occidentalis) occur with redcedar only in the interior. Coastal redcedar plant communities in British Columbia have been classified into 24 associations under 9 alliances in the Thuja-Rubus spectabilis order (35). Communities listed in less detailed coastal classifications include redcedar/swordfern, redcedar/devilsclub/maidenhair fern, redcedar/maidenhair fern-ladyfern, redcedar-western hemlock/devilsclub/ladyfern, redcedar-grand fir/mountain boxwood, redcedar-grand fir/swordfern, redcedar-Douglas-fir/Oregongrape, redcedar-Sitka spruce-red alder/skunkcabbage-slough sedge, and redcedar/skunkcabbage (12,28). The redcedar/skunkcabbage plant community also occurs in the interior; where redcedar/devilsclub, redcedar/devilsclub/coolwort (Tiarella trifoliata), redcedar/queenscup (Clintonia uniflora), and redcedar/maidenhair fern are found (7,28,42).",Associated Forest Cover,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,1,1
"Coastal western redcedar receives from less than 890 mm (35 in) of annual precipitation to more than 6600 mm (260 in), mostly as winter rainfall; interior western redcedar, about 710 mm (28 in) in the north, 810 to 1240 mm (32 to 49 in) farther south-about half as spring and autumn rain, one-third as winter snow (2). Although western redcedar is abundant in many forested swamps, it is sometimes found on sites that are too dry for western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) (12,39,42), probably because the root penetration of the redcedar is better. Redcedar leaves are not protected from excessive transpiration by cutin and wax. Trees tolerate stagnant winter water tables averaging less than 15 cm (6 in) below the soil surface on the Olympic Peninsula (32). The species dominates wet ravines and poorly drained depressions in both Glacier National Park in Montana and the Selway Bitterroot Wilderness in Idaho (20,21). Where sufficient precipitation is present, low temperature appears to limit the species' range. Length of the frost-free period abruptly decreases just above the tree's upper elevation limits on Vancouver Island. The northern limits of western redcedar lie between the 11.1° and 11.7° C (52° and 53° F) mean summer temperature isotherms in southeastern Alaska. Absolute minimum temperatures experienced by western redcedar in British Columbia are -10° to -30° C (14° to -22° F) in coastal populations, -14° to -47° C (7° to -53° F) in the interior (28). Western redcedar has a growing season of at least 120 frost-free days along the coast but as few as 75 frost-free days in some portions of its interior range. It is not resistant to frost and is sometimes damaged by freezing temperatures in late spring or early autumn.",Climate,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,2,1

"Western redcedar grows along the Pacific coast from Humboldt County, CA (lat. 40° 10' N.), to the northern and western shores of Sumner Strait in southeastern Alaska (lat. 56° 30' N.). In California, it is common only in the lower Mad River drainage and the wet region south of Ferndale in Humboldt County; it is found elsewhere only in isolated stands in boggy habitats (19). North of the California-Oregon border, the coastal range broadens to include the western slopes of the Cascade Range north of Crater Lake and the eastern slopes north of about latitude 44° 30' N. (12). Optimal growth and development of western redcedar are achieved near the latitudinal center of its range- Washington's Olympic Peninsula. North of the Olympic Peninsula and Vancouver Island, the coastal range narrows again and is restricted to the Coast Ranges and offshore islands. A few scattered stands are found between the Coast Ranges and the Selkirk Mountains near the southern border of British Columbia, but redcedar's coastal range is essentially isolated from its interior range. The interior range extends south from the western slope of the Continental Divide at latitude 54° 30' N. in British Columbia through the Selkirk Mountains into western Montana and northern Idaho (2). The southern limit is in Ravalli County, MT (lat. 45° 50' N.). With the possible exception of a few trees east of the Continental Divide near the upper end of St. Mary Lake, Glacier County, the eastern limit of the range of redcedar is near Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park, MT. - The native range of western redcedar.",Native Range,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,11,1
"Western redcedar seems to vary less than other northwestern conifer species. Lack of isoenzyme variation in newly germinated seedlings from western Oregon and eastern and western Washington indicates that redcedar populations contain little genetic polymorphism (5). Isoenzyme variability is also low in British Columbia (56). Leaf oil terpene composition is similar in populations at both low and high elevations in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana; but small differences between coastal and interior populations were recently detected by discriminant analysis of the chemical data (53). Seedlings from different seed sources usually have remarkably similar forms and growth rates when grown in the same environment. Inland populations are more tolerant of frost than those from coastal populations, however (46), and plantation trials indicate that provenances from Alaska are inferior to those from Oregon and Idaho when grown in Poland (31). Seed orchards have been established in Denmark, where resistance to leaf blight and frost have been shown to be homozygously recessive (52).",Population Differences,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- When grown in the open, western redcedars begin to produce strobili at 10 years of age and usually every other year thereafter. Strobilus development can be artificially induced at younger ages and increased in mature trees by girdling or treating with gibberellin (8). The species is monoecious; male and female strobili are produced on different branches of the same tree, at different heights-the reddish male strobili on lower branches and the green female strobili nearer the treetops and farther from the trunk (38,52). Anthesis and pollination occur during March and April in southern stands near the coast. They occur during May and June in coastal Alaska and interior stands (47). Seed Production and Dissemination- Each mature strobilus usually produces only 3 to 6 seeds (8), but the strobili are often numerous and heavy seed crops are common. In dry years, conebearing stands in the interior tend to be on high, moist sites (14). Average annual seed crops vary from 247,000 to 2,470,000 seeds per hectare (100,000 to 1 million/acre) in coastal forests and from 54,000 to 274,000/ha (22,000 to 111,000/acre) in the interior. Major seedfall occurs during October and November in both ranges (2). Gibberellin-treated, containerized seed orchards should permit efficient management of seed production and harvesting (8). Seeds are small- 448,000 to 1,305,000/kg (203,000 to 592,000/1b) (47). They fall faster and do not fly as far as the seeds of western hemlock, Sitka spruce, and Douglas-fir, but dissemination is adequate within 100 m (330 ft) of a seed source (4,30). The seeds usually germinate well without stratification, and they retain their initial viability for at least 7 years when stored dry (5 to 8 percent moisture) at -18° C (0° F) (8). Germination is epigeal. Seedling Development- Most seeds escape rodent and bird predation, but seedling mortality is high during the germination period (15). Where moisture and temperature conditions are favorable, germination can occur in the autumn, winter, or spring. Almost no germination occurs after the first year, however. Seedbed quality may be critical. Throughout the range of western redcedar, disturbed mineral soil seedbeds seem to be a major requirement for regeneration from seed (41). Although unburned soil benefits redcedar more than soil that has been scorched, slash burning favors redcedar by creating more mineral soil surfaces in cutover areas. Rotten wood that is in contact with the soil is the preferred seedbed in old redcedar groves (41). Partial shade is beneficial because drought and high soil temperature damage seedlings in full sunlight, and poor root penetration causes damage from drought in full shade (48). Direct seeding in the autumn is successful where soil moisture is available, but large quantities of seed may be required to obtain adequate stocking. In the nursery, spring sowing is best; half-shaded seedbeds are recommended (47). Pelleting the seeds makes them more compatible with automated nursery sowing machinery (8). Containerized nursery seedlings can be produced in 7 months. They survive as well or better than bare-root stock when planted in coastal Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, but 2-year-old bare-root stock tends to be most cost effective in the coastal range (6). When bare-root stock is planted, recently lifted dormant seedlings with low shoot/root ratios should be used and cold storage avoided whenever possible. Containerized stock planted in the spring appears to perform better than bare-root stock in the interior (18). Natural regeneration is important in the northern Rocky Mountains, where it is most frequently successful on westerly and northerly aspects in western redcedar habitat types (18). Western redcedar seedlings are less tolerant of high soil temperature and of frost than are the seedlings of Engelmann spruce, grand fir, and Douglas-fir. The exposed upper foliage of young redcedars often sunburns severely (31). Roots of seedlings grow more slowly than the roots of Douglas-fir and incense-cedar, but they outgrow the roots of seedling western hemlock and Sitka spruce. Shoots have a longer growth period than any associated conifer. Non-rigid leaders are produced, and neither lateral nor terminal shoots form dormant buds. Lateral shoot growth is vigorous, amounting to at least 80 percent of terminal shoot growth in young redcedars (31). Seedlings account for most of the western redcedar regeneration in clearcuts and other disturbed areas. On good coastal sites, they grow as tall or taller than Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and Sitka. spruce seedlings during the first 5 years (6,51). The redcedars are subsequently overtaken by Douglas-fir (by age 10) and western hemlock (by age 15). Vegetative Reproduction- Three types of natural vegetative reproduction occur: layering, rooting of fallen branches, and branch development on fallen trees. The resulting ""veglings"" are more abundant than seedlings in mature Idaho stands (40). Saplings that have been knocked down in the western Cascades often regenerate when their branches root. Redcedar clones are easily propagated by the rooting of stem cuttings. Although untreated cuttings will root, a 1-minute dip in a 3,000 ppm solution or a 4-hour soak in a 200 to 400 ppm solution of indolebutyric acid improves rooting speed, the number of cuttings rooted, and the total length of roots per cutting. Ramets for seed orchards can be produced by treating cuttings with indolebutyric acid, then rooting them in a 1-to-1 mixture of peat and perlite (8). Young fragmented stems can be induced to bud after being soaked in a cytokinin solution, and the resulting buds can be rooted on a culture medium that contains napthalineacetic acid and kinetin (33).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Intermediate redcedars are distinguishable from dominants by age 5 on good sites. Codominants usually can be differentiated from dominants by age 25. Mean annual height growth of the dominants is 0.5 m (1.64 ft) in 40- to 60-year-old, pure, second-growth stands on moist sites in western Washington (36). Annual radial increments of 10 mm or even 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 in) occur on the best moist sites in the south coast region of British Columbia (39). Pure, even-aged stands can attain volumes comparable to pure Douglas-fir stands by age 50 on high-quality upland sites in western Washington (37), Plantations should be dense (about 2,470 trees per hectare or 1,000/acre), and intermediate crown classes should be removed in a light thinning to reduce side shade at about age 25 (22,36). Stands of 370 to 430 crop trees/ha (150 to 175 crop trees/acre) at time of harvest may allow maximum diameter growth without causing poor form (36). Maintaining a nearly closed canopy at all times will benefit form because open-grown redcedars tend to develop excessively large limbs and multiple tops. Faster growing trees of acceptable quality can be grown at wide spacings if their lower holes are pruned (50), but percentages of latewood decrease significantly (49). Volumes of 379 to 825 m³/ha (5,418 to 11,782 ft³/acre) were measured in 40- to 60-year-old pure second-growth stands on moist sites in western Washington (36). A yield model on medium sites in British Columbia indicates yields of 70 m³/ha (1,000 ft³/acre) at age 40, 350 m³/ha (5,000 ft³/acre) at age 115, and 595 m³/ha (8,500 ft³/acre) at age 270; maximum current annual increment occurs at 82 years and maximum mean annual increment at 130 years (34). In Great Britain, the cumulative volume produced by normal western redcedar stands on poor sites is 50 m³/ha (714 ft³/acre) at age 20 and 953 m³/ha (13,620 ft³/acre) at age 80. On good sites, cumulative volume produced is 232 m³/ha (3,315 ft³/acre) at age 20 and 1839 m³/ha (26,268 ft³/acre) at age 80. The average age of maximum mean annual increment is 72 on poor sites and 58 on good sites in these British stands (22). At ages 20 and 50, cumulative volume production is lower for western redcedar than for Douglas-fir and Sitka. spruce in Great Britain, but by age 80 the redcedar volume production is higher than that of Douglas-fir and spruce (45). Growth is often much slower. Suppressed redcedar trees that are 200 years old but only 7.6 cm. (3 in) in d.b.h. and 7.6 m (25 ft) tall are not unusual. Survival for such long periods of suppression may be due to the ability of the species to produce new root growth in full shade. It may also be a result of frequent root grafting. Dominant trees often support growth of the root systems and lower boles of suppressed trees (9). Rooting Habit- Tree roots are extensive. Redcedars made up only 17 percent of the basal area but accounted for 82 percent of the root length in a mixed-species stand in northern Idaho (29). Tap roots are poorly defined or nonexistent, but fine roots develop a profuse, dense network. Western redcedar roots usually are deeper than the roots of western hemlock but shallower than the roots of western larch, western white pine, grand fir, and Douglas-fir (30). The soils on which these species usually grow may be responsible, however, because western redcedar, western hemlock, and Douglas-fir trees of similar size growing on similar soils have roots that penetrate to similar depths and extend over similar areas (10). Shallow root systems are most frequent where soil bulk density is high. Redcedar roots cannot grow in dense soils penetrated by the roots of Douglas-fir, red alder, lodgepole pine, and Pacific silver fir (30). Redcedar root systems also tend to be shallower and less extensive on wet sites than they are on deep, moderately dry soils. Where a thick duff layer is present, many redcedar roots lie in the duff rather than in the underlying soil. Root grafting is common (9). Western redcedar mycorrhizae are of the vesicular-arbuscular type, and redcedar seedlings are more responsive to mycorrhizal inoculation than are the seedlings of redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (27). Reaction to Competition- Only Pacific silver fir, western hemlock, and Pacific yew are more tolerant of shade than western redcedar (30). Its relative tolerance may be higher in warm than in cool areas, but redcedar is very tolerant wherever it grows, and it may be ""the species of choice"" for reforesting high, brush-risk areas near the coast (6). Often present in all stages of forest succession, redcedar occupies pioneer, seral, and climax positions (39). Multiple attributes seem to be responsible-redcedar invades disturbed areas as widely distributed seeds but regenerates vegetatively in undisturbed areas, tolerating competition in both (26). Nevertheless, it is usually considered a climax or near climax species. Western redcedar is best managed on moist sites characterized by the presence of ladyfern, queenscup, mountain woodfern, oakfern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris), or thimbleberry. On poorly drained sites of lower quality, fertilizing with nitrogen appears to benefit growth (37). Urea seems to be a better source of that nitrogen than ammonium nitrate (54). Redcedar can be grown in stands of mixed species where uneven-aged management is practiced or when redcedar poles are to be produced under normal even-aged management regimes. But pure stands are more suitable for the long rotations needed to produce large sawtimber, shingles, and shakes. Where western redcedar is managed in mixed-species or uneven-aged stands, its excellent shade tolerance and long life should be considered. Redcedar is usually overtopped by Douglas-fir, grand fir, western hemlock, and western white pine. It tolerates understory conditions in mixed-species stands but often grows slowly there. In uneven-aged stands, western redcedar can maintain acceptable growth rates over long periods, but it should not be given excessive crown space. Thinning from above may release the redcedars in mixed-species stands; thinning from below is preferable in uneven-aged stands of western redcedar. In the northern Rocky Mountains, growth response to release is best on large, young redcedars with green-yellow foliage growing on northerly aspects (17). Redcedars probably should not be released when overtopped, however, because much of the increased growth after their release often occurs in large branches and a spreading crown rather than stem wood (37). Most western redcedars are harvested by clearcutting the mixed-species stands in which they grow. Because of steep terrain, decay, and breakage, redcedar harvesting costs are high and lumber recovery is low (55). Redcedars should not be left as scattered seed trees, however; even those along clearcut margins may be lost to windthrow or exposure. Effects of slash-burning vary with site conditions, but low-impact spring burns tend to benefit the mycorrhizal colonization of seedlings (6). Damaging Agents- Western redcedar is less susceptible than its associates to most damaging agents, but, as it is longer lived, damaged trees are common. Although they are as windfirm as Douglas-fir on dry sites, redcedars, are often windthrown in wet environments and are not resistant to windthrow on the moist sites where growth and yield are highest. Fire resistance also varies with environment. Redcedar is more severely damaged by fire than any of its associates along the coast but is less susceptible than Engelmann spruce, western hemlock, and subalpine fir in the interior (30). Western redcedar suffers little damage from insects, but it is a host for several economically important insect species (13). One of the most important is the gall midge, Mayetiola thujae, which sometimes seriously damages redcedar seeds in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Newly planted seedlings are occasionally damaged by a weevil (Steremnius carinatus) in British Columbia, and larger trees are killed by a bark beetle (Phloeosinus sequoiae) on poor sites in southeastern Alaska. The western cedar borer (Trachykele blondeli) causes degrade and cull in sawtimber. More than 200 fungi are found on western redcedar, but it is less susceptible to pathological attacks than are most of its associates. Indeed, redcedar may be a suitable alternative species on coastal Douglas-fir and western hemlock sites where soils are infected with Phellinus weiri, Fomes annosus, or Armillaria spp. (37). Nevertheless, many attacks occur during the long lives of some redcedar trees, and the heartwood extractives that provide decay resistance are eventually detoxified through biodegradation by a series of invading fungi (25). As a result, the volume of accumulated decay in living trees is greater for western redcedar than for any other major conifer in British Columbia (25), and hollow old trees are common in the interior (7). The major seedling disease, Didymascella thujina, is a leaf blight that infects 2nd- and 3rd-year nursery seedlings. As much as 97 percent of the natural redcedar reproduction may also be killed when this blight reaches epidemic proportions (2). Epidemics are rare in North America, however, and Didymascella is not as damaging here as it is in Europe, where the disease seriously limited production of planting stock until cycloheximide fungicides were developed (3,52). In North America, the most important fungi attacking redcedar are root, butt, and trunk rots (23). The root and butt rots include Phellinus weiri, Armillaria mellea, and Poria subacida. Poria asiatica and P. albipellucida are the most important trunk rots near the coast; P. asiatica and Phellinus weiri are most important in the interior range of western redcedar (2). These rots are most evident in old stands, where much of the standing volume is often defective and unmerchantable. Redcedar seedlings and saplings are often severely browsed by deer, elk, or rodents, and browse damage may be the most important stand-establishment problem (6). Western redcedar is damaged more than Sitka spruce by salt spray. Its foliage is more severely damaged by sulfur dioxide than is the foliage of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and Sitka spruce and less damaged than the foliage of subalpine fir and grand fir. Redcedar is damaged less than Douglas-fir by airborne fluorides and ozone (30).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,14,1
"Western redcedar can tolerate a wide range of soil proper-ties in most localities. Soils on which it is most commonly found are in the orders Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Histosols. It is found on all landforms, soil textures, and parent materials on Vancouver Island (39). In southwestern Oregon, it grows on sedimentary, metasedimentary, gabbroic, dioritic, granodioritic, and occasionally even serpentinite and peridotite parent materials (24). Coarse sandy soils are not well suited to establishment and growth of redcedar in northern Idaho and northeastern Washington, but rocky slopes with limited soil development support redcedars in southeastern Alaska. Poorly drained organic soils also support redcedar south of Petersburg, AK. It grows on loams, clays, sands, chalk downland, and Molina-Juncus peat in England, but is most competitive on fine-textured lowland soils there. It grows well on shallow soils over chalk and can tolerate both acid and alkaline soil conditions (45). Western redcedar seems able to survive and grow on soils that are low in nutrients and is found on such soils over much of its natural range. Site index is positively correlated with foliar nitrogen, sulfur, copper, boron, and chlorophyll. However, productivity may be improved by fertilization (44). When grown in well watered soil fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, redcedar seedlings outgrow the seedlings of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), grand fir (Abies grandis), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), western hemlock, and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Available nitrogen, calcium, and water appear to be the most important factors affecting growth and establishment of redcedar. Established redcedars tend to raise soil cation exchange capacities, pH's, and amounts of exchangeable calcium (1) and thus benefit the soils in which they grow. Western redcedar grows from sea level to 910 m (3,000 ft) in southeastern Alaska. In British Columbia, the elevational range is higher-from sea level to 1190 m (3,900 ft). Redcedar is found in the interior from 320 m (1,050 ft) to 2130 m (7,000 ft). The greatest range in elevation occurs in Oregon, where the species occurs from sea level to 2290 m (7,500 ft) at the rim of Crater Lake.",Soils and Topography,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,15,1
"Shingles and shakes constitute the most important special use of redcedar. Attractive appearance, durability, lightness, and superior insulation qualities probably are responsible for its popularity as a roofing material. Wood is also used in utility poles, fenceposts, piling, paper pulp, clothes closets and chests, caskets, crates, boxes, beehives, and fishtrap floats. Perfumes, insecticides, medicinal preparations, veterinary soaps, shoe polishes, and deodorants are made from cedar leaf oil. Redcedar extractives and residues are used in lead refining, boiler-water additives, and glue extenders (31). When properly trimmed, redcedars make excellent hedges. Their drooping branches, thin fibrous bark, and flat sprays of scalelike leaves make redcedars attractive ornamental trees. The leaves are a major winter food for big game in the northern Rocky Mountains, and deer browse redcedar all year along the coast.",Special Uses,Western Redcedar,thuja,plicata,conifer,16,1
"Western white pine is represented in 18 forest cover types of western North America and Canada. It is the key species in Western White Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 215) (9). In this type, western white pine constitutes a plurality of stocking, but many other species such as grand fir (Abies grandis), subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), California red fir (A. magnifica), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), western larch (Larix occidentalis), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) may also be present. Most often the western white pine component of Type 215 is even aged with an understory containing multi-aged trees of the more shade-tolerant species such as western hemlock and western redcedar. Occasionally, light overstory components of more intolerant species, such as western larch and lodgepole pine, may also be present. In the 17 other cover types, western white pine is a common component, along with many other species, including Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), white fir (A. concolor), noble fir (A. procera), Port-Orford-cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), foxtail pine (P. balfouriana), limber pine (P. flexilis), sugar pine (P. lambertiana), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), red alder (Alnus rubra), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera).

Western white pine is a major seral species in the Tsuga heterophylla / Clintonia uniflora habitat type in western Montana and is also present in several others (21). Western white pine is present in several vegetative associations, communities, and zones in western Oregon and Washington but is a major constituent only of the Tsuga heterophylla zone in the Puget Sound area of Washington (5,11,14). Most of the habitat types, associations, and communities in Washington, Oregon, and the Inland Empire where western white pine grows are strikingly rich in other woody and herbaceous flora (5,6,11,14,21). In contrast, in the Sierra Nevada the vegetation associated with western white pine is characteristically sparse. Shrubs associated with western white pine include huckleberry (Vaccinium spp.), willow (Salix spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), wintergreen (Gaultheria spp.), azalea (Rhododendron spp.), prickly currant (Ribes lacustre), sticky currant (R. viscosissimum), Rocky Mountain maple (Acer glabrum), Greenes mountain-ash (Sorbus scopulina), princes-pine (Chimaphila umbellata), snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), whipplea (Whipplea modesta), ocean-spray (Holodiscus discolor), serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), spirea (Spiraea betulifolia), pachistima (Pachistima myrsinites), and twinflower (Linnaea borealis). Graminoids frequently associated with western white pine include sedge (Carex spp.), woodrush (Luzula spp.), Columbia brome (Bromus vulgaris), pine grass (Calamagrostis rubescens), and nodding trisetum (Trisetum cernuum). Forbs found growing with western white pine include false solomons-seal (Smilacina spp.), twistedstalk (Streptopus spp.), coolwort (Tiarella spp.), violet (Viola spp.), wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), queenscup (Clintonia uniflora), western goldthread (Coptis occidentalis), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), sweetscented bedstraw (Galium triflorum), white trillium (Trillium ovatum), and Brewers lupine (Lupinus breweri).",Associated Forest Cover,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,1,1
"The portions of Vancouver Island, the Cascade Mountains, and the Siskiyou Mountains that are within the range of western white pine have cool maritime climates, with wet winters and dry summers. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the region depending on elevation and exposure. Variation with latitude from northern Oregon through British Columbia is small, however (25). In general, precipitation on Vancouver Island and in the Cascade Mountains averages from 1500 to 2010 mm (59 to 79 in) per year while precipitation in the Siskiyou Mountains averages from 510 to 1520 mm (20 to 60 in) per year. The winter snow line varies with latitude and averages 600 m (2,000 ft) elevation, with dense heavy snowpacks common. Occasionally, vegetation and the forest floor are coated with a layer of ice from glaze storms. Temperatures of the Vancouver Island-Cascade Mountain portions of the western white pine range vary from a low of -18° C (0° F) to a maximum of 38° C (100° F). January is usually the coldest month in the region and July and August are the warmest. Frost-free days range from 200 days in coastal areas to 90 days in the Cascades. In the Sierra Nevada where western white pine grows, the mean annual precipitation varies from 760 to 1500 mm (30 to 59 in). Except for occasional summer thunderstorms, this total falls entirely as snow. The temperature of the area averages between -9° C (15° F) in February to 27° C (80° F) in July and August, with maximum temperature near 37° C (98° F) and a minimum temperature near -32° C (-26° F). In the Sierra Nevada, frost-free days of the western white pine range average between 90 and 180 days, but killing frosts can occur at any time. The climate of the Inland Empire in the western white pine range is influenced by the Pacific Ocean some 400 km (248 mi) to the west. The summers are dry, the majority of the precipitation occurring during the fall and winter. Precipitation averages between 710 and 1520 mm (28 and 60 in), distributed seasonally as follows: 35 percent, winter; 24 percent, spring; 14 percent, summer; and 27 percent, fall (28). Snowfall averages 262 cm (103 in) but ranges from 122 cm (48 in) to 620 cm (244 in). Annual temperatures in the inland range of western white pine average from 4° to 10° C (40° to 50° F) with extremes of -40° and 42° C (-40° and 107° F). The growing season for western white pine in the Inland Empire is irregular depending on location and year but averages between 60 and 160 days (28). The boundaries of the western white pine range in the Inland Empire are limited at the lower elevations by deficient moisture and at the upper elevations by cold temperatures. The southern boundary of the type in the Inland Empire is not fixed by insufficient precipitation alone, but by a balance of precipitation and evaporation (28).",Climate,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,2,1
"Western white pine can be easily crossed with other five-needle white pines (3). It hybridizes successfully with Balkan pine (Pinus peuce), blue pine (P. griffithii), eastern white pine (P. strobus), Japanese white pine (P. parviflora), southwestern white pine (P. strobiformis), and limber pine (P. flexilis). Hybridization with Swiss stone pine (P. cembra), Korean pine (P. koraiensis), and whitebark pine (P. albicaulis) has not been as successful.",Hybrids,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,9,1
"Several single recessive genes are recognized in western white pine (3). Albino genes, chlorophyll deficient genes, a curly foliage gene, and a dwarfing gene have been found. Monoterpenes also appear to be under strong genetic control. Height growth gains of 4 to 12 percent are possible according to estimates from progeny testing and selections. Work on inheritance of blister rust resistance in western white pine began in 1950. This early work indicated considerable heritability of blister rust resistance. Most foliar resistance is governed by genes reducing the frequency of secondary needle infections and causing slow fungus growth in secondary needles (3). In the stem, genetic resistance is governed primarily by genes controlling a fungicidal reaction and causing slow growth of the fungus. Other resistance mechanisms include lowered frequency of needle lesions, premature shedding of needles, and fungicidal reaction in the short shoot. Nursery and field tests of rust resistant seedlings after two cycles of selections indicate rust resistance of 66 and 88 percent, respectively.",Hybrids,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,9,1
"Western white pine grows along the west coast from latitude 35° 51' N. in southern Tulare County, CA, to latitude 51° 30' N. near Butte Inlet in southern British Columbia. Along the west coast, the species grows on Vancouver Island, in adjacent British Columbia, southward through Washington and Oregon, and in the Cascade Mountains (7). It is also found in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon and northern California, in the Sierra Nevada of California, and near Lake Tahoe, NV. In the interior, western white pine grows from latitude 52° 30' N. near Quesnel Lake, BC, southward through the Selkirk Mountains of eastern Washington and northern Idaho, and into the Bitterroot Mountains in western Montana. Its southernmost interior limit is in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon (latitude 44° 14' N.). Isolated populations are found as far east as Glacier National Park, MT. It attains its greatest size and reaches its best stand and commercial development in the Inland Empire, which includes northern Idaho and adjacent sections of Montana, Washington, and British Columbia (28). - The native range of western white pine.",Native Range,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,11,1
"Western white pine is different in genetic variation from most other conifers that have been intensively studied (26). Within northern Idaho, western white pine genetic variation is high, and most of this variation is among trees within a stand. Differences among stands and elevational zones occur, but the proportion of the variance attributable to these sources is usually smaller than that for trees within stands. Evidence indicates little geographic or ecologic differentiation of populations for western white pine. The adaptation of western white pine to different geographic, climatic, topographic, and edaphic conditions is governed more by phenotypic plasticity than by selective differentiation (22). Also, it appears that there is little difference among populations from coastal Washington and western British Columbia and northern Idaho populations (27). There appear to be genetic differences, however, between California populations and Idaho populations (23). Because of the small genetic variation detected in populations of western white pine in northern Idaho, seeds can be transferred without regard to elevation, latitude, longitude, or habitat type.",Population Differences,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- Western white pine is monoecious. Three complete growing seasons are required for seed to mature. Strobilus buds are differentiated during July and August of the growing season before their appearance in June the following spring (28). In northern Idaho, the oval staminate strobili are about 10 cm (4 in) long, borne in clusters of 15 to 25 on branches of the middle crown, and are distinguishable about June 1 (28); whereas, in the Sierra Nevada of California, the staminate strobili appear near the first of July. Pollen dissemination in the Inland Empire usually begins during the last week of June and can continue to the middle of July but usually averages 8.5 days. The greenish-yellow to bright pink ovulate strobili are borne on stalks at tips of the upper branches, and in the Inland Empire become visible about mid-June of the growing season following initiation of the primordia. The erect conelets are from 1.5 cm to 4.0 cm (0.6 to 1.6 in) long at time of pollen dissemination , and they grow to 2.5 cm to 5.0 cm (1.0 to 2.0 in) long by the end of the first growing season (28). Time of anthesis may vary over a period of 20 days and is rigidly controlled by temperatures during the weeks immediately preceding anthesis. Anthesis is delayed about 5 days per 300 m (980 ft) increase in elevation, and about 6 days per degree Fahrenheit below normal temperatures for May and June (28). In the Inland Empire, good strobilus crops in western white pine occur every 3 to 4 years, the major cycle being 4 years. Warm, dry ""stress"" periods, during the early summer of the 2 years before strobilus emergence, favor strobilus production. In contrast, stresses in the late summer of the year prior to emergence or during the period of emergence depress strobilus production. Within individual trees and within localities, maxima pollen shedding and ovulate anthesis practically coincide. No phenological barriers to either selfing or crossing appear to exist, but most western white pine show a moderate to strong discrimination against self-pollination. Western white pine seedlings that result from self-pollination are typically slower growing than seedlings resulting from cross-pollination (3). Western white pine is predominantly female from first strobilus production at age 7 through age 20 (3). Cultural treatments, such as watering, fertilizing, and cultivating, usually have little effect on this characteristic, but thinning and fertilizing 40-year-old western white pine with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium has increased it (1). Seed Production and Dissemination- Cones of western white pine become ripe during August and September of the second year after the strobilus buds are initiated. Color of ripe cones ranges from yellowish or beige-brown through reddish brown and dark brown (17). Western white pine cones are about 20 cm to 25 cm (7.9 to 9.8 in) long; cones as short as 5 cm (2.0 in) and as long as 36 cm (14.2 in) have been reported. Over 18 years, 380 western white pine from 25 to 70 years old in the Inland Empire produced from 2 seeds to more than 300 seeds per cone, with a mean production of 226 (2). Western white pines can begin cone production as early as age 7 and become more prolific with age. Not until trees are about age 70 does cone production become both frequent and abundant. It continues to increase with age until trees are about 50 cm (19.7 in) in diameter. After that, seed production depends on individual tree vigor and character of crown or possibly on heritable capacity to set and bear cones (298). Seed yields for western white pine range from 30,900 to 70,500/kg (14,000 to 32,000/lb) with an average of 59,000/kg (27,000/lb) (17). In the Inland Empire, seed production varies from 41,000 to 457,000/ha (16,600 to 185,000/acre), with average annual seed yields for a 75-year-old stand and an over-mature stand of 8,600/ha (3,500/acre) and 99,000/ha (40,100/acre), respectively. Several cone and seed insects and rodents can cause partial to almost complete failures of cone crops in otherwise poor to fair crop years. The cone beetles, Conophthorus monticolae and C. lambertianae, and cone moths, Dioryctria abietivorella and Eucosma rescissoriana, cause serious seed losses some years (12). Western white pine seeds are also a favorite food of red squirrels and the deer mouse. In the Inland Empire, seed dissemination of western white pine begins in early fall; 15 percent of the current crop reaches the ground before September 1, about 85 percent by the end of October, and 15 percent during the late fall and winter (28). Seeds are usually disseminated by wind, but squirrels, mice, and various birds contribute to seed dissemination. Most seeds fall within 120 m (390 ft) of the parent tree, but they have been known to travel over 800 m (2,620 ft) from it (28). Western white pine seeds remain viable after overwinter storage in duff on the forest floor. Seeds have shown 40 percent viability after one winter's storage, and 25 percent viability after two winters' storage; and less than 1 percent after 3 and 4 years' storage. Western white pine seeds properly stored under artificial conditions of seed moisture content of 5 to 10 percent and temperatures of -18° C (0° F) to -15° C (5° F) remain viable for 20 years (17). Seedling Development- Western white pine seed requires 30 to 120 days of cold, moist conditions before germination commences (17). Seed dormancy appears to be controlled by the seed coat, papery seed membrane, and physiological elements of the embryo, gametophyte, or both (16). There is a strong genetic component to seed germination with high family heritability. Both fresh seed and stored seed require cold stratification temperatures of 1° C (33° F) to 5° C (41° F) to break dormancy. Germination is epigeal. The seeds of western white pine usually germinate in the spring in soil that was wet to field capacity by melting snow. In the Inland Empire, seed germination at lower elevations begins in late April. At higher elevations and on protected sites, germination may be delayed until early June. Germination can continue on exposed sites until July 1 and on protected sites until August 15. Under full sun, germination begins much earlier and ends much earlier than in partial or fully shaded conditions. Soil temperatures probably control the beginning of germination, and drying out of the topsoil or duff probably stops germination (28). Light appears to have little importance in natural germination of western white pine seed. Mineral surfaces are better germination media than duff even though duff may contain many stored seeds. During the first growing season, a high percentage of seedlings die, principally because of diseases, but insects, rodents, and birds cause serious seedling losses. Fusarium, cause of a damping-off disease, and Neopeckia coulteri, a snow mold, can cause extensive seedling mortality during the first year (15). Seedlings up to 5 years old are often killed by Rhizina undulata, a root rot, in patches 0.5 m (1.6 ft) to 1.5 m (5 ft) in diameter. Seedling mortality late in the first growing season is due primarily to temperature and drought. High surface temperature is the most important cause of mortality on exposed sites, and drought is a factor on heavily shaded areas where root penetration is slow and unable to keep pace with receding soil moisture. For the most part, western white pine seedlings have low drought tolerance (20). All factors considered, western white pine seedling establishment is favored by partial shade on severe to moderately severe sites. On the more sheltered sites, such as north slopes, little or no shade is best for seedling establishment (28). Once established, western white pine grows best in full sunlight on all sites. Early root and shoot growth of western white pine seedlings usually is not rapid. The first summer, the primary root grows about 15 cm (6 in) to 30 cm (12 in) in open situations, between 13 cm (5 in) and 23 cm (9 in) under partial shade, and only 5 cm (2 in) to 8 cm (3 in) under full shade. Seedlings planted in soils rich in nutrients, high in organic matter, and with low bulk densities can have first-year root elongation up to 50 cm (20 in). Seedlings usually average between 3 cm (1 in) and 5 cm (2 in) in height by the end of the first growing season. In the Inland Empire, open-grown western white pine seedlings require about 8 years to reach a height of 1.4 m (4.5 ft) (28). Similarly, 20-year-old western white pine grow about 81 cm (32 in) to 99 cm (39 in) per year on good sites and about 23 cm (9 in) to 46 cm (18 in) on poor sites. Both height growth and diameter growth of western white pine in the Inland Empire usually begin about the first week of May but may begin as early as April 5 and as late as June 25 depending on elevation, latitude, and aspect (24). Also, in the Inland Empire, leaf buds usually open near May 21 but may open as early as March 27 and as late as June 21. Here, shoot growth usually ends by August 11; reported dates for shoot growth cessation are as early as June 9 and as late as October 21. Winter buds can be formed as early as June 14 and as late as September 30 but are usually formed by August 13. In the Inland Empire, diameter growth normally ceases by the end of August. Old needles usually turn straw yellow between the middle of August and the first week of September and drop soon thereafter. Total needle fall of western white pine is moderate when compared to associated species (20), with needle retention of 3 to 4 years. Vegetative Reproduction- Western white pine does not naturally reproduce by sprouting or layering. Cuttings from trees more than 4 to 5 years old are difficult to root (3), although cuttings from 3-year-old seedlings have been rooted with fair success using rooting hormones. Needle bundles from 2-year-old seedlings have produced roots and some have produced shoots successfully. Western white pine is relatively easy to propagate by grafting at all ages (3). Several types of grafts have been used; early spring grafting before flushing has been most successful. Also, scions, taken from a variety of places in the tree crown, graft with equal success. Grafting conducted under greenhouse conditions is more successful than field grafting. Interspecies grafting on other five-needle rootstocks, such as eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), sugar pine (P. lambertiana), and blue pine (P. griffithii), has been generally successful. Grafting of western white pine on species other than the five-needle white pines has not been accomplished.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Western white pine trees most often have clean boles with minimum taper and narrow crowns. In the absence of western white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), the species is long lived; trees are commonly 300 to 400 years old and rarely, up to 500 years old. Overmature trees are often more than 180 cm (71 in) in d.b.h. and 60 m (197 ft) tall. Tables 1 and 2 show the sizes, net volume, basal areas, and growth rates for western white pine in fully stocked stands in the Inland Empire. Although blister rust modifies stand development, in the absence of the rust, stands develop as shown. Rooting Habit- The extent of western white pine's root system and the density of its rootlets depend on external conditions (18). Approximately 65 percent of the total root system, exclusive of the central vertical system, occurs in the uppermost 30 cm (12 in) of soil. Mature western white pine systems can spread 8 m (26 ft) laterally from the root collar with verticals descending off the lateral system, as well as in a concentration beneath the root collar. The root systems are tolerant of dense soils and have moderate growth rates. Western white pine trees have approximately 75 percent of their absorbing surface in the upper 60 cm (24 in) of the soil (28). Fine root development of western white pine is favored where vegetative competition is low and available moisture is high. The fungi that have been reported to form mycorrhizae with western white pine are Suillus granulatus, S. subaureus, S. subluteus, Boletellus zelleri, Cenococcum graniforme, Gomphidius ochraceus, G. rutilus, Russula delica, R. xerampelina, and Tricholoma flavovirens. Reaction to Competition- Western white pine is almost always a seral species. It is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance when compared to other northwestern tree species. The species attains a dominant position in the stand only following wildfires, even-aged silvicultural systems, or through cultural stand treatments favoring the species. Western white pine can be regenerated using even-aged silvicultural systems. On favorable sites, clearcut, seed-tree, and shelterwood systems result in adequate and diverse natural regeneration within 5 to 10 years after the regeneration cut. If a natural blister rust-resistant seed source is not present on the site, planting can be used to regenerate the stands. Western white pine seedlings are well suited for planting. Both bare-root and container-grown western white pine seedlings have excellent survival and growth when properly planted on appropriate sites. Bare-root stock has better survival with spring planting, but containerized stock appears to have excellent survival when planted during either season. When natural regeneration and the clearcut system are used for establishing conifer mixtures that include western white pine, it is not uncommon to regenerate 11,000 trees per hectare (4,451/acre), of which 1,000/ha (405/acre) are western white pine (4). Similarly, seed-tree cuts can produce 12,000 trees per hectare (4,856/acre) of which 1,500/ha (607/acre) are western white pine. Shelterwood systems produce more trees, but the proportion that are western white pine is less than for other systems. On southerly aspects, regardless of the cutting system, less regeneration occurs. The individual tree selection system cannot be used to manage western white pine successfully because it tends to favor the more shade-tolerant species, such as western redcedar and western hemlock, but group selection may have limited application. Where reproduction has become established under partial cuttings, the density of overstory and time until removal greatly affect development. Western white pine growth can be inhibited even by the shade of a light shelterwood. Sixteen-year-old western white pine growing under an overwood density of 6 m²/ha (27 ft²/acre) were 2.0 m (6.6 ft) tall compared to trees 0.5 m (1.6 ft) tall growing under an overwood density of 21 m²/ha (91 ft²/acre) (28). The composition of a western white pine stand is determined during the first 30 years of the stand's life (13). Lodgepole pine and western larch can grow one and one-half times as fast in height as western white pine during this period. Western larch can usually maintain its superiority in height growth through maturity, but lodgepole pine's growth superiority seldom lasts past age 50. Similarly, grand fir can equal western white pine height growth for the first 30 years and Douglas-fir is about equal in height growth. On northerly aspects and in shaded conditions, western hemlock height growth can equal that of western white pine (8). Dominant western white pine over age 30 responds to release, but not aggressively. In the Inland Empire, in 55- to 65-year-old stands, half of the basal area must be removed to gain lasting improvement (10). The effectiveness of light to moderate thinnings in 55- to 65-year-old stands of western white pine is short-lived. Therefore, during the first 30 years, species composition is relatively plastic and can be modified materially by changing the density of residual overwood and by weeding or thinning. Beyond age 30, treatments are less effective and must be drastic to be long lasting. Damaging Agents- At one time or another, fire has left its mark on practically every part of the western white pine forest (28). Western white pine depends on fire or timber harvesting to remove competing conifers and allow it to become established as an early seral species. Its relatively thin bark and moderately flammable foliage make it intermediate in fire resistance among its conifer associates (20). As a result of fire protection and the lack of major fires, plus blister rust infection, the proportion of western white pine regeneration (planted and natural) in northern Idaho, eastern Washington, and western Montana decreased from 44 percent in 1941 to 5 percent in 1979. Western white pine when dormant is tolerant of cold and along with lodgepole pine is one of the more frost-tolerant northwestern species. Needle desiccation can occur when cold, drying winds cause excessive loss of moisture that cannot be replaced fast enough because of cold or frozen soil or tree trunks. Also, western white pine is more tolerant of heat than most of its more shade-tolerant associates. The species is sensitive to both sulfur dioxide and fluoride smelter fumes, which cause the foliage to yellow and drop prematurely (15,20). Depending on the site, western white pine is relatively windfirm, but considerable damage can occur from windthrow. Snow often causes breakage in young pole stands. Western white pine is beset by many serious diseases (15). By far the most prominent disease of western white pine is blister rust. In northern Idaho and contiguous parts of Montana and Washington, a combination of climate, abundant alternate host plants (species of Ribes), and susceptible pines contribute to heavy losses. But, through selection of naturally rust resistant trees for seed sources for natural regeneration and planting of rust resistant nursery stock, damage to western white pine stands from blister rust in the future should be minimal. Other stem diseases, such as dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium laricis, and A. tsugense, occur on western white pine; however, they are of little consequence. In prolonged periods of drought, pole blight, a physiological disorder, can occur in stands of the 40- to 100-year class, causing yellow foliage and dead resinous areas on the trunk. Later the top dies and, in a few years, the tree. The disease does not appear to be caused by a primary pathogen but results from rootlet deterioration in certain soils restricting the uptake of water. The disease, a consequence of a drought from 1916 to 1940 (19), caused serious mortality to western white pine from 1935 to 1960. At present, the disease is not a major cause of mortality in western white pine stands. In conjunction with pole blight studies, root lesions caused by Leptographium spp. were isolated; these could have a role in the decline caused by pole blight. A needle blight, caused by Lecanosticta spp., often leads to shedding of foliage more than I year old. Another foliage disease that attacks mainly the upper and middle crown is needle cast caused by Lophodermella arcuata. Two other needle cast fungi, Bifusella linearis and Lophodermium nitens, attack isolated trees. The foremost root disease of western white pine is Armillaria spp., causing fading foliage, growth reduction, root-collar exudation of resin, dead and rotten roots, and black rhizomorphs. Heterobasidion annosum and Phellinus weiri also cause some mortality of individuals and groups. The most important butt-rot fungi are Phellinus pini, Heterobasidion annosum, and Phaeolus schweinitzii. Many other fungi are capable of causing decay in injured or overmature trees, and rot often becomes excessive in trees over 120 years of age. The bark beetles are the most important group of insects that attack western white pine. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) kills groups of trees, primarily in mature forests. Trees weakened by blister rust are often attacked by the mountain pine beetle. Likewise, weakened trees are sometimes attacked by the red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens). Usually, this beetle is not aggressive and does not become epidemic, but through repeated attacks it can kill trees. More often, it just weakens them, leading to fatal attack by other bark beetles (12). Attack of western white pine by mountain pine beetle sometimes results in attack on the bole by emarginate ips (Ips emarginatus). Likewise, the ips beetle (Ips montanus) attacks weakened western white pine, its principal host, in association with other bark beetles. The Pityogenes fossifrons beetle breeds principally in western white pine, but its attacks are seldom primary. The beetle is capable, however, of attacking western white pine reproduction. Many other bark beetles and insects attack western white pine, but, for the most part, they do not cause extensive damage.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,14,1
"A wide variety of soils support western white pine along the west coast of Washington and Oregon (11). The species reaches its best development on deep, porous soils but is most common on poor, sandy soils. The soils are derived from a wide variety of parent material but are generally moderately deep with medium acidity. Organic matter content is usually moderate, and textures range from sandy loam to clay loam. The majority of the soils in which western white pine grows have been classified as Spodosols. In the Puget Sound area, extensive stands of western white pine grow on soils originating from glacial drift. Soils of the Inland Empire western white pine region are very diverse. Soil depths range from 25 cm (10 in) to over 230 cm (90 in) and have developed from decomposed granite, schist, quartzite, argillite, sandstone, and shale. Most often, the more rocky soils have developed from basalt, glacial deposits, alluvial deposits, or lacustrine deposits (28). In the Inland Empire, the upper soil layers that support western white pine are composed of loess or loessial-like material. As along the west coast, most of the soils that support western white pine in the Inland Empire are Spodosols. The pH of soils supporting western white pine in the Inland Empire ranges from 4.5 to 6.8 with a mean near 5.4 (6). The cation exchange capacity of these soils ranges from 20.5 to 28.5 meq/100 g with a mean of 25.1 meq/100 g. Mean concentrations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium are 0.5, 10.5, and 0.8 meq/100 g, respectively. Nitrogen content of soils of the Inland Empire western white pine range varies from 0.14 percent to 0.48 percent with a mean of 0.25 percent. Western white pine grows at a wide range of elevations. In interior British Columbia, it grows at elevations up to 450 m (1,480 ft), while on Vancouver Island it is normally found at elevations up to 1200 m (3,940 ft) and has been found at elevations over 1500 m (4,920 ft). In western Washington, western white pine is found growing at sea level (near Puget Sound) and up to 910 m (2,980 ft) in elevation in the Cascades. Farther south in the western Cascades, it grows between elevations of 600 and 1850 m (1,970 and 6,070 ft). On the eastern side of the Cascades, it is found growing between elevations of 350 and 1450 m (1,150 and 4,760 ft). In the Olympic Mountains, the species ranges from sea level to an elevation of 550 m (1,800 ft). In the Siskiyou Mountains, western white pine is found at elevations from 1830 to 2140 m (6,000 to 7,020 ft). Farther south in the Sierra Nevada, it usually grows at elevations from 1830 to 2300 m (6,000 to 7,550 ft) with occasional trees at elevations of 3350 m (10,990 ft). In northern Idaho and contiguous parts of Washington, Montana, and British Columbia, western white pine usually grows between 500 m (1,640 ft) and 1800 m (5,910 ft). Here the topography is usually steep and broken with V-shaped and round-bottomed valleys. Western white pine can grow on a variety of slopes and aspects but is most common along moist creek bottoms, lower benches, and northerly slopes. The most extensive bodies of western white pine are found in the wide river bottoms, less steep lower slopes, and in the more gently rolling country of the Priest, Coeur d'Alene, St. Joe, and Clearwater River basins (28).",Soils and Topography,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,15,1
"Because western white pine wood is nonresinous, it is highly desired for the manufacture of moldings and trim. Also, western white pine is used for pattern stock, in cabinet shops, and for home handicraft because of its softness and workability. The clear grades of lumber are used for patterns in the foundry industry, mainly because of the high degree of dimensional stability. Decorative plywood is manufactured by slicing, and a limited amount of rotary-cut veneer is manufactured for industrial use. Western white pine grows in some of the finest western outdoor recreation areas and has considerable esthetic value. In addition, the long, distinctive cones are collected in considerable numbers for novelties or souvenirs.",Special Uses,Western White Pine,pinus,monticola,conifer,16,1

"White ash and Texas ash (Fraxinus texensis (Gray) Sarg.) intergrade in Texas. The pumpkin ash (Fraxinus profunda (Bush) Bush) behaves in many respects as if it were a true breeding hexaploid derivative of a cross between tetraploid white ash and diploid green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.). However, attempts have failed to artificially cross the two species. It is likely that natural hybridization between white ash and other species is extremely rare (16).",Hybrids,White Ash,fraxinus,americana,hardwood,9,0
"White ash grows naturally from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, to northern Florida in the east, and to eastern Minnesota south to eastern Texas at the western edge of its range (7). -The native range of white ash.",Native Range,White Ash,fraxinus,americana,hardwood,11,0
"White ash contains several phenotypic variants of leaf form that appear to be genetically controlled even though they are randomly distributed throughout the natural range. Chief among these are 9-leaflet, narrow-leaflet, blunt-leaflet, ascidiate leaflet, partially pubescent, purple-keyed, and crinkle-leaf forms. A purple leaf variant is vegetatively propagated and grown as an ornamental. White ash is a polyploid species. Diploids (2n=46) occur throughout the species range but most tetraploids (2n=92) are found south of latitude 35° N and hexaploids (2n=138) are concentrated between latitude 35° and 40° N. Although three ecotypes were previously recognized on the basis of seedling morphology and ploidy level (15), recent work has shown that the variation in several traits is closely related to latitude. This clonal variation and the strong effects of ploidy level on several other traits indicate that ecotypes probably do not exist in white ash (2).",Population Differences,White Ash,fraxinus,americana,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- White ash is dioecious; flowers appear with or just before the leaves in April and May. A good seed crop is produced about every third year. The time between the first noticeable enlargement of the male flower buds until shedding is 2 to 3 weeks. Pollen shedding from an individual tree usually takes 3 or 4 days. The pollen is carried by wind as far as 100 in (328 ft) from the point of dispersion. Female buds are completely open a few days after they begin to swell. Exposed flowers remain receptive for about I week, but once the stigmas discolor, the period of receptivity is past. Abundant seed crops are borne by about half of the flowering trees. Good seeds are produced in all parts of the crown. Almost 99 percent of the fruits (samaras) contain one seed, about 1 percent contain two, and a very small percent have twin embryos. Vigorous trees may first flower when only 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) in d.b.h., but white ash is usually 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) in d.b.h. before it flowers abundantly. Seed Production and Dissemination- The seed is dispersed by wind up to 140 in (460 ft) from the parent tree. White ash seed has a very pronounced dormancy. Although the embryo is completely developed morphologically at the time of seedfall (September to December), the physiological state of the endosperm and embryo inhibit germination. Seeds must be stratified under moist conditions for 2 or 3 months before they will germinate, and the average laboratory germination is 54 percent. The minimum seed-bearing age is 20 years (14). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal. Natural regeneration from seeds will occur if the soil, humus, or leaf litter is wet in the spring. Under experimental conditions, seedlings developed best in 45 percent of full sunlight (8). Thus silvicultural systems that can provide sunlight, such as shelterwood or clearcutting, have been recommended for white ash. Photoperiodic response appears to vary with geographic location. North Carolina seedlings showed no growth response to a 14.5-hour daylength. In a Massachusetts test, however, northern seedlings ceased height growth and dropped their leaves well before the first frost, while southern seedlings continued height growth until late autumn. Vegetative buds begin to enlarge in April or May. Height growth is 90 percent complete in 30 days, and 100 percent complete in 60 days. Diameter growth generally continues until August. Young white ash exhibits strong apical dominance. Thrifty open-grown seedlings 2 in (6.6 ft) tall often have only two or three pairs of lateral branches, and sometimes none. If the terminal bud is removed, apical dominance is altered and new branches develop from the uppermost pair of lateral buds. Generally one of these grows faster than the other and soon assumes apical control. Vegetative Reproduction- Stumps of freshly cut seedling and sapling white ash sprout readily. Usually only one or two stems are produced. This species can be propagated by conventional methods of budding, grafting, or layering. Even open field and bench grafting of unpotted stock are highly successful. Diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid white ash have all been successfully grafted on diploid stock.",Reproduction and Early Growth,White Ash,fraxinus,americana,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Depending on the amount of root competition, a field-grown white ash tree in full sunlight may take from 3 to 15 years to become 1.5 m (5 ft) tall. By then, its root system is usually well established and white ash is able to grow rapidly even if surrounded by weeds. Post-juvenile growth rates of dominant and codominant trees in unthinned, even-aged stands in central Massachusetts are as follows: Yield tables are not available for white ash in pure stands. However, for plantations in Canada ranging in age from 20 to 38 years, We growth of the dominant and codominant trees averaged 3 to 5 mm. (0.1 to 0.2 in) per year in diameter and 0.2 to 0.8 m (0.7 to 2.6 ft) in height (13). In mixed Appalachian hardwood stands, diameter growth ranged from 3 to 8 mm (0.1 to 0.3 in) per year, depending on site quality and individual tree variation. Rooting Habit- White ash generally forms a taproot that in turn branches into a few large roots that grow downward. From these vertical roots, single lateral branches develop at intervals. Intraspecific grafting is common. The distribution of roots is strongly influenced by soil type. On a loamy sand, most of the roots, both large and small, were in the A horizon. On a fine sandy loam, the majority of the fine roots were in the B, horizon, and the large roots equally in the A and B1. Knowledge of mycorrhizal associations is limited. Gyrodon merulioides has been reported on white ash. Seedlings inoculated with the endomycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae and G. fasciculatus grew markedly better than nonmycorrhizal controls (12). Reaction to Competition- White ash is a pioneer species that establishes itself on fertile abandoned fields in several parts of the country. In the Southeast, much of the abandoned agricultural land is incapable of supporting white ash. On such sites, white ash establishes itself only after some site protection and improvement has been accomplished by pines. However, pioneer ash often do not develop into good timber trees unless other hardwoods or pines are also present to provide competition and reduce branchiness. Open-grown trees commonly remain single stemmed and fine branched until they are 9 to 12 ni (30 to 40 ft) tall, although old specimens can become as broad crowned as an elm. With even slight crowding, the single-stemmed characteristic can easily be maintained throughout a rotation. Shade-killed branches drop quickly-small ones within a year or two and larger ones within 4 or 5 years (16). Uninjured terminal buds suppress the growth of all lateral buds on the current year's growth, and they suppress the growth of other laterals to such an extent that each internode has only one pair of branches that persist more than a few years. Even the strongest lateral branches grow only half as fast as the terminal except on old, open-grown trees. Little or no epicormic branching occurs on the boles of released trees. The branches of dominant trees emerge from the bole at about a 35° angle from the vertical, whereas the branches of intermediate trees emerge at about a 55° angle (16). When young, white ash is a shade-tolerant tree. Seedlings can survive under a canopy with less than 3 percent of full sunlight but grow little under these conditions. Seedlings that receive sufficient sunlight grow rapidly. With increasing age, white ash becomes less tolerant of shade and is classed overall as intolerant. The decrease in shade tolerance with increasing age is reflected in the fact that young white ash is abundant in the understory of northern hardwood stands, but few grow into the overstory unless provided with light from above. Despite its low shade tolerance, white ash is characteristic of intermediate as well as early stages of natural plant succession. Throughout its range it is a minor but constant component of both the understory and overstory of mature forests on suitable soils. It owes its position in the final overstory to its ability to persist for a few years in moderately dense shade and to respond quickly to openings in the canopy created by death or other causes. White ash can be maintained more easily in a dense stand than can some of its more shade-intolerant associates, such as northern red oak. In contrast, dominant or codominant white ash responds readily to thinning and within a few years will increase its crown area to take full advantage of any reasonable release (16). Damaging Agents- Ash decline (also called ash dieback) is the most serious problem affecting white ash. Especially prevalent in the northeastern part of the tree's range, this disease complex occurs from the Great Plains to the Atlantic coast between 39 and 45 degrees north latitude (10). The disease, ash yellows, caused by mycoplasma-like organisms (MLO), has been found associated with most of the dying trees where ash decline is conspicuous (9). However, since not all dying trees are infected with MLO, ash decline is thought to result from multiple causes. Drought-weakened trees may be invaded by cankercausing, branch-girdling fungi such as Fusicoccum spp. and Cytophorna pruinosa. Additional stresses that may be involved in the etiology of ash decline are air pollution, leaf-spotting fungi, and viruses. Control recommendations are based primarily on maintaining good tree vigor (6). Air pollution damages white ash. It is rated as sensitive to ozone and is severely injured by stack gases from soft coal consumption and from industrial processes, both of which emit sulfur dioxide. Two leaf spot fungi, Mycosphaerella effigurata and M. fraxinicola, are common in nurseries and in the forest and cause premature defoliation of white ash. Anthracnose (Gloeosporium aridum) also causes premature defoliation and is most serious following exceptionally wet springs. An ash strain of tobacco ringspot virus causes chlorotic areas on the leaves and has been associated with ash dieback. A rust (Puccinia peridermiospora) distorts petioles and small twigs. Cankers caused by Nectria galligena may cause branches to break but are rarely found on main stems. Heartwood rots may be caused by Perenniporia fraxinophilus, Phellinus igniarius, Pleurotus ostreatus, Tyromyces spraguei, and Laetiporus sulphureus. These organisms usually enter through wounds or broken branches, mainly on older trees. Of 26 species of nematodes reported from the roots or root zones of white ash, only one, Meloidogyne ovalis, has been associated with root injury. However, nematodes can be vectors for the ringspot virus (5). Of the insect pests, the oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi) is the most serious. Severe infestations cause yellowing of the leaves, and if prolonged, may kill some trees. The cottony maple scale (Pulvinaria innumerabilis) also attacks white ash. The brownheaded ash sawfly (Tomostethus multicinctus) and the blackheaded ash sawfly (Tethida cordigera) are defoliators that are of concern mainly on ornamental trees. The forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and the green fruitworm (Lithophane antennata) feed on forest trees and occasionally cause complete defoliation within small geographic areas. The larvae of sphingid moths-Sphinx chersis (the great ash sphinx), S. kalmiae, and Ceratornia undulosa-feed on the leaves of white ash, as does the notched-wing geometer (Ennomos magnaria). The larvae of two leaf roller moths, Sparganothis dilutocostana and S. folgidipenna, also feed on ash. The ash bark beetle (Leperisinus aculeatus) may cause slight injury when the adults bore into the bark to hibernate. The ash borer (Podosesia syringae) may seriously damage young shade and shelterbelt trees. The ash and privet borer (Tylonotus bimaculatus) attacks and kills branches, especially on older trees. Both the red-headed ash borer (Neoclytus acurninatus) and the banded ash borer (N. caprea) colonize cut logs and dead or dying trees (1). White ash seedlings are easily damaged or destroyed by deer and cattle browsing. Rabbits, beaver, and porcupine occasionally use the bark of young trees for food.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,White Ash,fraxinus,americana,hardwood,14,0
"White ash has demanding soil fertility and soil moisture requirements. These requirements may be provided by soils derived from a variety of parent materials-limestone, basalt, shale, alluvium, and fine glacial till. A large number of soil types may support white ash, many of which are included in the Hapludalfs and Fragiudalfs of the order Alfisols, Haplorthods and Fragiorthods of the order Spodosols, and Dystrochrepts and Fragiochrepts of the order Inceptisols (11). White ash grows most commonly on fertile soils with a high nitrogen content and a moderate to high calcium content. Nutrient culture results show that an absence of nitrogen reduces seedling dry weight by 38 percent compared to seedlings grown in complete nutrient solution, and that calcium is the second most important macroelement, followed by sulfur (3). Its pH tolerance varies from 5.0 to 7.5. Soil moisture is an important factor affecting local distribution. Best growth occurs on moderately well drained soils, including areas underlain by compacted glacial till; light textured, well drained, glacial drift; and sandy to clay loam soils in which roots can penetrate to a depth of 40 cm (16 in) or more. Although rarely found in swamps, white ash is intermediately tolerant of temporary flooding. White ash is found in various topographic situations. It grows from near sea level in the southeastern Coastal Plain to about 1050 m (3,450 ft) in the Cumberland Mountains and up to 600 m (1,970 ft) in New York's Adirondack Mountains. In the hilly and mountainous areas of the Northeast, it grows on the mesophytic lower and middle slopes, usually stopping short of both the dry, oak-pine ridgetops and the cold, spruce-fir mountain tops. In the Coastal Plain, white ash usually is limited to the slightly elevated ridges in the floodplains of major streams. In the Central States it is most common on slopes along major streams, less common in upland situations, and rarely found in the flat bottoms of major streams or in depressions (16).",Soils and Topography,White Ash,fraxinus,americana,hardwood,15,0

"White basswood is a component of five forest cover types (5): White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 52), Yellowpoplar (Type 57), Yellow-Poplar-Eastern Hemlock (Type 58), Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 59), and Silver Maple-American Elm (Type 62).

"Currently three species of Tilia in North America are recognized: T. americana, T. heterophylla, and T. caroliniana (9,10), although there are no known races or varieties within them. Recent studies of field specimens, field plots, and nursery plantings indicate that the variation in Tilia is essentially clinal. Pubescence and stellate hairs tend to be absent in the northwest portions of the ranges of basswoods but abundant in South Carolina (2). Flavonoid variation patterns indicate definite differences between northern and southern populations and show an intermediate zone in the southern Appalachians (7). These patterns suggest that there is only one species, Tilia americana L., in the range from Massachusetts to North Carolina. The population occupying the remaining southeastern portion of the range could be named T. americana var. heterophylla. Hybrid swarms between white basswood and other species have been observed outside the glaciated area in southern Ohio (4). It has also been suggested that the absence of distinct morphological differences between species of basswood leads to inconstancy of insect pollinators and hence to hybridization (1).",Genetics,White Basswood,tilia,heterophylla,hardwood,7,0
"The range of white basswood extends from southwestern Pennsylvania west in southern Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to Missouri; south to northern Arkansas; east to northeastern Mississippi, Alabama, northwestern Florida, and Georgia; and north to Maryland. Outlying populations occur in eastern Pennsylvania and western New York. It reaches its largest growth in the Appalachian Mountains, where it is often dominant. However, it is most common in the mixed mesophytic forests of the Cumberland Plateau, where it is second only to sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in frequency (10,11). -The native range of white basswood.",Native Range,White Basswood,tilia,heterophylla,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- White basswood flowers in the latter part of June and early July. Once flowering begins, flowers, pollen, and nectar are abundant. The perfect flowers are protandrous; the anthers usually open in the afternoon and release pollen for 24 hours, after which the stigmas become receptive and nectar production begins. There are 66 insect species known to pollinate basswood; bees and flies are the most common diurnal visitors and moths the principal nocturnal visitors. Nocturnal pollinators produce somewhat less fruit set than diurnal pollinators. Although insect pollination is predominant, wind pollination plays a minor role. White basswood is not self-compatible (1). The fruits are nutlike, leathery or woody, ellipsoidal, about 13 mm (0.5 in) long, and covered with rust-brown, woolly hairs. The fruits are borne in clusters of six or seven on bracts. The bracts, which are shaped like long, slender leaves, may serve as wings for the purpose of wind dispersal or may function primarily as flags to attract nocturnal pollinators. The light-colored bracts are distinct against the dark foliage at night (1). Seed Production and Dissemination- White basswood seeds ripen in September and October following pollination and are dispersed in the winter and spring. Little information exists on fruit set and seed dispersal of this species. In general, these events seem to differ little from those of American basswood (Tilia americana) (11). As with most tree seeds, natural germination is best on mineral soil. No specific information is available for white basswood, but in general, basswood seeds may remain dormant for as long as 2 or 3 years (12). Seedling Development- Little is known about the early growth of white basswood. Immediate sowing after early collection of American basswood fruits (when they first turn slightly brown) has been found to give good germination success. Germination is epigeal. Basswood seedlings are usually planted as 1-0 or 2-0 stock (12). Vegetative Reproduction- White basswood sprouts vigorously and commonly grows in clumps of three to six or more stems. Although clump growth is good, the trees are frequently defective and susceptible to sleet and wind damage. Hence, stands of sprouts are less desirable than those of seedling origin (11).",Reproduction and Early Growth,White Basswood,tilia,heterophylla,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Mature white basswood may exceed 27 rn (90 ft) in height and 91 cm (36 in) in d.b.h. Typically, the bole is free of branches, smooth, and cylindrical. The growth rate of basswood is intermediate compared with other southern Appalachian species; it grows faster than most of the oaks and maples, but considerably slower than yellow-poplar and northern red oak. Economic maturity for sawtimber is estimated to be a d.b.h. of between 43 and 61 cm (17 and 24 in), depending on the vigor class of the tree (11). No volume or yield tables are available for white basswood. A standing inventory of basswood-including net annual growth, removals, and mortality-is available for five Southeastern States (table 1). Although white basswood is not distinguished from American basswood in this survey, the latter species grows only in the northern and westernmost portions of Virginia and North Carolina. White basswood grows in all five States. Rooting Habit- White basswood roots have been found to have ectotrophic mycorrhizae; a fungus grows on the outside of the short root to form a mantle, and two rows of spherical cells are present in the cortex to form a Hartig net (8). Reaction to Competition- Basswood is classed as shade tolerant, and variations between American basswood and white basswood are not noted (11). Damaging Agents- White basswood is relatively free of serious diseases, although it is attacked by cankers, rots, stains, leaf spots, and wilt. Discolorations of the wood are common following wounding of any type, but they are not considered serious defects unless decay enters before the wound heals. Decay fungi attacking white basswood include species of Daedalea, Fomes, Hydnum, Pholiota, Pleurotus, Polyporus, Irpex, and Stereum. Basswoods of stem sprout origin or seedlings that have been wounded are likely to become highly defective; often the main bole of such trees will be almost entirely hollow (6,11). Cankers caused by Nectria galligena are common on basswood but are not considered serious problems. Other stem diseases of minor importance are Nectria cinnabarina, Botryosphaeria ribis, and Strumella coryneoidea. Leaf spots are common but do not cause excessive damage. The common leaf spots are caused by species of Cercospora, Phyllosticta, Gnomonia, Phlyctaena, and Asteroma. Wilt caused by species of Verticillium is known to occur in white basswood but so far has been of no consequence in forest stands (6,11). White basswood is also comparatively free of serious insect enemies, but it is the host of many defoliators, several borers, aphids, and gall midges. Common defoliators include the basswood leafroller (Pantographa limata), elm spanworm (Ennomos subsignaria), linden looper (Erannis tiliaria), whitemarked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma), variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), basswood leafminer (Baliosus nervosus), bagworm (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis), and the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica). Important borers include the linden borer (Saperda vestita), Chrysobothris azurea, flatheaded sycamore-heartwood borer (Chalcophorella campestris), which enters the wood at wounds, Dicerca lurida, ambrosia beetles (Platypus compositus), and the twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) (3). Like those of yellow-poplar, the tender twigs and smaller branches of basswood are readily browsed by livestock and white-tailed deer. Because of its thin bark, basswood is very susceptible to fire damage, especially at the seedling and sapling size. Consequently, butt rot is very common and a serious problem in burned stands.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,White Basswood,tilia,heterophylla,hardwood,14,0
"Quite particular in its soil and moisture requirements, white basswood cannot tolerate very wet or very dry conditions, and it almost always grows on moist but well-drained soils. This tree grows best along mountain streams or in mountain coves where the soils have an alluvial or a colluvial origin. These soils are deep, friable, and have considerable humus (11). White basswood is found on soils of five orders, Inceptisols, Ultisols, Alfisols, Entisols, and Mollisols. Of these, Inceptisols and Ultisols occupy by far the largest areas, and their common property is moisture availability for more than half the year or for more than 3 consecutive months during the warm season. Moisture availability during the warm season is also a property of Alfisols, which are present in the western portions of the range of white basswood, but it is not a property of Entisols and Mollisols. However, the latter orders occupy very small areas in the southern and western margins of the species range (13). Although rare at very low elevations, basswood is occasionally found on the Coastal Plain but appears with increasing frequency in the upper Piedmont. It is common in the Appalachian Mountains at elevations between 900 m (3,000 ft) and 1500 m (5,000 ft), where it usually grows on north and east exposures and on flood plains or in deep, moist coves (11).",Soils and Topography,White Basswood,tilia,heterophylla,hardwood,15,0
"Because of its soft texture, light weight, and dimensional stability, basswood lumber (including that of white basswood) is a choice wood. In addition to lumber uses, it is highly desirable for veneer, slack cooperage, excelsior, drawing boards, and particleboard; other values include bee pasture, yielding a fragrant honey, and shade and ornamental plantings (12).",Special Uses,White Basswood,tilia,heterophylla,hardwood,16,0
"The most common associates of California white fir in the mixed conifer forests of California and Oregon include grand fir (Abies grandis), Pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), incense-cedar (Libocedrus decurrens), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), sugar pine (P. lambertiana), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) (21,47). In the central Sierra Nevada, white fir is a major associate of the relatively rare giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (21). Species mix varies with elevation, site, and latitude. White fir is more abundant on the cooler, wetter sites. California white fir is a major climax component throughout the mixed conifer forests within its range. It is displaced successionally only at its northern limits in Oregon, where western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and perhaps western redcedar (Thuja plicata) replace white fir as a climax species on moister sites (22). At the upper elevational limits of the mixed conifer forest, white fir dominates, occasionally forming pure stands. Still higher, white fir mixes with California red fir (A. magnifica) in transition to the red fir type. In the southern Sierra Nevada, white fir in this transition zone generally tolerates canopy closure better and dominates on nutrient-rich sites (46). Lodgepole pine is common in these white fir and mixed fir forests, growing around meadows and along streams. Individuals of Jeffrey pine, western white pine (P. monticola), and sugar pine are scattered through the forest (47). In Oregon, scattered western hemlocks are also found (22). At low elevations California white fir is an aggressive, tolerant species that appears to have been held in check by frequent natural fires. Extensive fire control efforts, however, have reduced fire frequency. As a result, white fir is becoming a major stand component in California at elevations and on sites where originally it was minor (48). Dense fir regeneration beneath older stands of less tolerant trees is common and threatens a major change in species composition. In many places, especially with giant sequoia, such changes are undesirable, and control measures, including reintroduction of fire, are necessary. In Arizona and New Mexico, Rocky Mountain white fir is a major climax component in 11 major habitat types and phases (42). Listed in sequence-from warm and dry low-elevation to cool and moist high-elevation environments-these habitat types include ponderosa pine/Arizona fescue, white fir/Arizona fescue, white fir-Douglas-fir, white fir-Douglas-fir/Gambel oak, white fir-Douglas-fir/Rocky Mountain maple, and blue spruce-Engelmann spruce/forb (Senecio spp.). White fir is a minor climax component in the Douglas-fir-southwestern white pine/grass (Muhlenbergia spp.), blue spruce-Douglas-fir, and blue spruce/sedge (Carex spp.) habitat types. Additional associates are subalpine and corkbark firs. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) is a major seral species in many areas. A variety of woody brush species can assume major importance in much of the white fir range, particularly in mixed conifer zones. Following drastic disturbance, brush can quickly occupy and dominate a site. Common species include mountain whitethorn, deerbrush, and other Ceanothus species, manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), currant and gooseberry (Ribes spp.), several chinkapins (Castanopsis spp.), and a few oaks (Quercus spp.) (21,22). In addition to severely competing for light and moisture (14), at least one Ceanothus species contains allelopathic chemicals in its foliage that suppress radicle growth of white fir (12). Mycorrhizal associations are thought to protect white fir roots from allelopathic chemicals produced by bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) (1). Other species of lesser vegetation that sometimes assumes a significant role includes bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa) and several grasses. Seeds of some species can lie dormant in the forest floor for as long as 300 years and germinate following removal of forest cover by fire or harvesting. In areas where brush is vigorous, tree seedlings that can survive and grow under brush cover are favored, provided the time between fires is long enough (e.g., 20 years) to allow the fir to establish crown dominance (13,21,40). Pure stands of white fir frequently begin this way. White fir is represented in at least 14 forest cover types of western North America. Pure stands are White Fir (Society of American Foresters Type 211) (19). It is a major component in Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer (Type 243) and is also found in the following types: 206 Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir 207 Red Fir 210 Interior Douglas-fir 216 Blue Spruce 217 Aspen 229 Pacific Douglas-fir 231 Port Orford-cedar 237 Interior Ponderosa Pine 244 Pacific Ponderosa Pine-Douglas-fir 245 Pacific Ponderosa Pine 247 Jeffrey Pine 256 California Mixed Subalpine",Associated Forest Cover,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,1,1
"Rocky Mountain white fir grows on high mountains, typically with long winters, moderate to heavy snowpacks, and short growing seasons. Annual precipitation ranges from about 510 mm (20 in) to slightly more than 890 mm (35 in). In the central Rocky Mountains, rainfall is distributed evenly during the summer months. In Arizona and New Mexico, summer tends to be wetter than spring (37). California white fir grows in cold, high elevations and in warm-to-hot low elevations. Precipitation ranges from 890 mm (35 in) to 1900 mm (75 in) or more per year. California white fir grows best in the southern Cascades and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, where precipitation is generally between 990 and 1240 mm (39 to 49 in). Locations receiving 1500 mm (59 in) or more are not uncommon, however (21). Essentially, all precipitation occurs during the nongrowing season. Fall and early spring rains are a major portion of the precipitation at lower elevations and winter snowpacks provide more than 80 percent of the moisture at high elevations (57). Occasional summer thundershowers are usually light. Growth studies on Swain Mountain Experimental Forest, in the southern Cascades of California, indicate that high-elevation stands of California white fir grow best in years with precipitation as low as 38 percent of normal (45). At these elevations low precipitation usually means early snowmelt and a longer growing season (54).",Climate,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,2,1
"White fir is an adaptable and genetically plastic species. Throughout its range, elevational and latitudinal gradients are reflected as changes in stomatal number and arrangement, needle shape, growth rate, phenology, (34), and trachied length (16). Interspecific crossbreeding is reasonably easy between fir species within the same group (e.g., A. concolor and A.grandis within Section Grandes), but difficult to impossible between sections (15,35,55). In the northern portion of its range, California white fir intergrades and hybridizes freely with grand fir, both being in the Section or group Grandes (15). The species are morphologically, ecologically, and chemically distinct (20,31). They differ in stomatal number and reaction to moisture stress (63). Grand fir grows most abundantly on cool, moist sites and white fir on warmer, drier sites. Grand fir has a higher incidence of heart rot than white fir. Grand fir bark has a red-purple periderm and is high in camphene. White fir bark periderm is yellowish and camphene content is low (62). Hybrid trees are intermediate in all of these characteristics, including incidence of heart rot, which may be more closely related to cool, wet sites than to genetic differences (26). Over a large area from northwestern California through central Oregon and into central Idaho, identification of the two species is difficult and sometimes impossible. White fir in this region is called ""grandicolor.""",Genetics,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,7,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- White fir is monoecious. The reddish male strobili (cones) are generally less than 1.6 cm (0.6 in) long and are densely grouped on the underside of 1-year-old twigs about midcrown. Female cones are borne erect on 1-year-old branches, usually in the uppermost crown although both male and female cones are occasionally found on the same branch. California white fir flowers in May or June and fertilization occurs shortly thereafter. Flowering of Rocky Mountain white fir at the higher elevations may be delayed and extend into July. Female cones reach full size, 7.5 to 13 cm (3 to 5 in) long, in late summer and turn from greenish or purplish to brown when mature (21,52). Cone specific gravity is about 0.85 when mature (52). The seed matures in September, up to 3 weeks before seedfall (44). Seed Production and Dissemination- Studies of white fir seed and cone production in Oregon, California, and the Rocky Mountains indicate that heavy crops are borne on a 3- to 9-year cycle (25,29,37). Adequate to good crops are produced more often, generally every 2 to 5 years. On extreme sites, cone production patterns may be different. Seed size varies widely and a kilogram may contain between 18,960 and 39,070 seeds (8,600 to 17,700/lb) (50). Relatively small proportions (20 to 50 percent) of white fir seed are sound, even in good seed years (21,52). Seed numbers, however, can reach 1.5 million/ha (600,000/acre) or more (24,30). Seed production varies with tree age, size, and dominance. The best, most reliable producers are mature, healthy dominants in the 30- to 89-cm (12- to 35-in) d.b.h. range (29). White fir trees can begin bearing cones when only 40 years old and continue beyond 300 years (45). Immature trees can produce heavy seed crops, but their performance is more erratic than that of mature trees (28). Because cones are borne almost exclusively in the uppermost part of the crown, any top damage caused by insects, diseases, or mechanical agents (for example, wind and snow) directly reduces cone production. Large old trees are prone to such damage. Trees that have lost their tops, however, can frequently develop new terminals and resume cone bearing. Studies in California indicate that mature dominants along the edge of a clearcutting produce between 1.5 and 6.7 times as many cones as similar trees in adjacent closed stands (28). Regeneration data, also from California, indicate that mature trees left in seed tree or shelterwood cuts increase seed production (42). Seeds are released as cones disintegrate on the tree. The white fir seed has a relatively short, broad wing for its weight and falls more rapidly than a pine or spruce seed. Because most dissemination is by wind, the distance of seed spread is more limited than that of many associated species. Reliable downwind seed spread into an opening generally is limited to 1.5 to 2 times tree height (28). Seedling Development- White fir seeds germinate in the spring immediately following snowmelt (37) or, where snowpacks are deep, in, on, and under the snow (23). In the Rocky Mountains, white fir germination in spring is in contrast to that of other major species in the mixed conifer type that do not germinate until the summer wet season (37). Seeds that germinate several centimeters above ground in the snowpack rarely survive after snowmelt. Seeds that fall before permanent winter snow cover, therefore, are more likely to produce seedlings. Germination and early growth are best on bare mineral soil. Root systems developed in mineral soil without organic layers are longer, heavier, and have more mycorrhizal root tips than those grown in soil with organic layers (6). White fir seedlings are epigeal. In general, white fir becomes established best in partial shade, but once established grows best in full sunlight. It is less tolerant of shade than associated true firs (except red fir), is slightly more tolerant than Douglas-fir, and is much more tolerant than pines or oaks (37,41,56). Because white fir can survive and grow beneath heavy brush cover and eventually overtop the brush and dominate the site, many pure stands exist in otherwise mixed conifer areas (36). Previously it was thought that white fir growth was extremely slow for the first 30 years. It appears now, however, that slow growth beyond 5 years is not inherent and may be caused by environmental conditions, such as prolonged shading and browse or frost damage. White fir is more susceptible to spring frost damage and deer browse than many associated species (37,41). Radial growth begins before height growth and lasts longer. Height growth begins later in white fir than in associated species at mid-elevations and lasts only about 6 weeks. Occasionally, in California, height growth begins again in late summer. The resulting succulent growth is subject to frost kill. White fir trees from low-elevation seed sources are twice as likely to increase height growth in response to moisture supplied during the summer than are white fir from high elevations or red fir from any elevation (33). Vegetable Reproduction- White fir shows no tendency to reproduce by sprouting or layering, but cuttings can be rooted with or without hormones. The relative ease with which cuttings from juvenile material can be rooted provides an opportunity to produce genetically selected planting stock at relatively low cost.",Reproduction and Early Growth,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- The capacity of white fir to produce large volumes per unit area was recognized before the species was considered of commercial value. As recently as 1962, white fir was regarded as undesirable in forests managed for timber. The productivity of fully stocked, 100-year-old stands in California (53,59) and eastern Washington and Oregon (11) on good [Site Index 27 m (90 ft)] and average [Site Index 18 m (60 ft)] sites is evident (table 1). The unusual productivity is possible, at least in part, because this species can grow in stands of high basal area. In mixed-conifer stands, white fir still demonstrates a high level of productivity, although its height growth begins to decrease earlier than that of associated species (10,17). Rooting Habit- Root systems of mature forest trees, including white fir, have not been the subject of much research. What little is known has been gleaned from observations of windthrown trees. Mature white fir rooting habit appears to be fairly adaptable: deep and intensive where soil conditions permit or shallow and widespread where rocks or seasonal water tables limit effective soil depth. There is no strong tendency to maintain a single deep taproot, although rapid taproot development is critical for survival of new germinants in the dry summer climate. White fir is susceptible to windthrow following partial cutting, especially when marginal codominant and lower crown classes are left as the residual stand. Root diseases contribute significantly to lack of windfirmness. Root grafting between firs is common and is frequently demonstrated by living stumps (21). Root grafting is also a factor in the spread of root rots. Effects of mycorrhizal associations are beginning to be explored. Early information indicates that these root and fungi relationships are significant, especially in establishment and early growth on poor sites, and that bare mineral soil promotes the association (6). Reaction to Competition- White fir has several features of major silvicultural significance. The species is classified as shade tolerant, more so than most of its mixed conifer associates (41). Relative shade tolerances of red fir and white fir in the high-elevation burning transition zone are uncertain. In the northern end of their respective ranges, shade tolerance may be affected by the evident exchange of genetic material with associated species-white fir with grand fir (A. grandis) and red fir with noble fir (A. procera) (2). White fir is capable of rapid growth to a large size and grows best in full sunlight. It can survive for exceptionally long periods as a suppressed tree and still respond to release by increasing growth dramatically. The time period before growth begins to accelerate varies depending on crown condition at time of release (36). Seed production increases following release even on dominant trees (38). Because of these features, white fir is a major management consideration in any mixed conifer stand where it is a component. Partial cutting and most shelterwood cuttings favor white fir and increase its importance in the stand. Prescribed burning in areas where white fir is not desired may be the only reasonable way to control its abundance. Underburning in groves of giant sequoia to control young white firs and to create seedbeds for giant sequoia reproduction is a special example. To manage pure stands of white fir is relatively easy and, with intensive management, young stands can be extremely productive. White fir can be regenerated naturally or artificially. Natural regeneration can be achieved through clearcutting as long as the maximum downwind width of openings does not exceed 1.5 to 2 times the height of trees left as seed sources. Shelterwood cuttings have been successful in establishing natural regeneration (30). On sites where brush competition is a problem, planting under shelterwood has promise. Because of high growth rates in dense, even-aged stands, even-aged management is the likely choice. Uneven-aged management is theoretically possible, however, because of the species' shade tolerance and response to release. The long period of extremely slow growth under shade and the incidence of dwarf mistletoe infestation make uneven-aged management questionable, however. Damaging Agents- White fir saplings and poles are susceptible to fire damage or kill, but trees become more resistant to both with age and size. White fir is considered more fire resistant than its associated species at high elevations (37,41), but less resistant than its associates at low elevations (47). Fire scars, commonly found in old-growth stands, provide an entry court for a variety of disease and decay organisms. White fir is sensitive to spring and fall frosts. Spring frosts can kill developing buds as well as foliage. Damage to established trees, other than Christmas trees, is not usually significant. On some sites, repeated damage to new fir growth can give a competitive advantage to more resistant species. Cold damage to mature trees takes the form of frost cracks and ring shake. Frost cracks are associated with some rot and decay loss (9). Sudden rises in temperature during May and early June can cause damage nearly identical to that of spring frosts. Sun-scalding following thinning is rare in mature trees, although young, thin-barked trees are susceptible. When white fir boles are injured, recovery is slow (9). Compared to its associated species, white fir is moderately susceptible to ozone damage. Although fir grows faster than associated species in southern California, diameter growth is affected by oxidant damage as much as that of Ponderosa pine (43). White fir is more resistant to fluoride damage than Douglas-fir or ponderosa pine (37). As intensive management of this productive species increases, so will the importance of mechanical injury. Studies in Oregon and California have shown that conventional logging techniques for thinning or partial cutting damaged 22 to 50 percent of the residual stand. Seventy-five percent of these wounds were at ground level, where infection by some decay-causing fungus is almost certain (3). Loss of volume by time of final harvest can be considerable. Two parasitic plants, white fir mistletoe (Phoradendron bolleanum subsp. pauciflorum), a true mistletoe, and white fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium abietinum f. sp. concoloris), cause major damage to white fir (9). In Arizona, Mexico, and the central to southern Sierra Nevada of California, white fir mistletoe is a serious problem on large old trees. Heavy infections cause spike tops, loss of vigor, and increased susceptibility to bark beetle attack. Dwarf mistletoe is a major problem from the southern Sierra Nevada north into Oregon. It is found elsewhere throughout the native range of white fir in coastal and southern California, Nevada, and Arizona (39,63). One-third of the white fir stands in California are severely infested by dwarf mistletoe and the parasite is present in other forest types that contain white fir. Heavily infected trees suffer significant growth losses and are prone to attack by Cytospora abietis, a fungus that kills branches and further reduces growth. Because of reduced vigor, infected trees are more susceptible to bark beetle attack and various diseases (50,51). Heart rots, entering through open mistletoe stem cankers, increase mortality of old-growth trees through stem breakage. Changes in wood structure in the large stem bulges caused by dwarf mistletoe infections reduce the strength of lumber produced. Current lumber grading practices, however, are not adequate to identify the affected wood (61). Dwarf mistletoe need not be a problem in young managed stands because three factors make damage subject to silvicultural control. The parasite is host specific: white fir can be infected only by A. abietinum f. sp. concoloris, which in turn can parasitize only one other fir, grand fir. Small trees (less than 1 m [3.3 ft] tall) are essentially free from infection even in infested stands. Infected young firs free from new overstory infection outgrow the spread of mistletoe if height growth is at least 0.3 m (1 ft) per year (50). Annosus root rot (Heterobasidion annosum) is present in all conifer stands and may become a major disease problem as management of white fir increases. Once established, the disease affects trees within a slowly expanding, circular infection center. Spread from tree to tree is through root contacts. New infection centers begin by aerial spread of spores and infection of basal wounds and freshly cut stumps. In true fir, annosus root rot usually does not kill directly but produces considerable moisture stress and loss of vigor that predispose the tree to attack by bark beetles, notably Scolytus. Direct damage resulting from infection is restricted primarily to heart rot of butt and major roots, leading to windthrow and stem breakage (9). Some degree of control is available through silvicultural means and use of borax on freshly cut stumps. Other rots of major significance include the yellow cap fungus (Pholiota limonella), Indian paint fungus (Echindontium tinctorium), and white pocket rot (Phellinus pini) (9). Yellow cap fungus causes heavy losses from butt rot and enters through fire scars and basal wounds (9). Indian paint fungus is a major heart rot organism. This fungus probably infects fir in the same manner it does western hemlock (3). Entry is through branchlets less than 2 mm (0.08 in) in diameter. The fungus can remain dormant for up to 50 years before being activated by injury to the tree (18). Rot commonly extends 3 m (11 ft) below and 6 m (20 ft) above each characteristic fruiting body (4). No effective control is known although trees less than 40 years old are relatively free of rot because they have so little heartwood. In the white fir-grand fir complex of Idaho, the fungus was found in 97 percent of the trees that had decay. Almost 80 percent of the decay in old-growth grand fir-white fir stands of eastern Oregon and Washington is caused by Indian paint fungus; in California, it is much less common (9). Insects from seven genera attack white fir cones and seeds. Two cause damage with considerable loss of seed. Seed maggots (Earomyia spp.) are the most abundant and damaging. The fir cone looper (Eupithecia spermaphaga) covers almost the entire range of white fir and periodically causes considerable local damage (27). Although many insects feed on white fir foliage, few cause significant damage as defoliators. The most destructive of these is the Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata). Over most of its range the tussock moth shows equal preference for true fir and Douglas-fir foliage. Epidemic outbreaks, although sporadic, are explosive and damaging. In California, white fir is the preferred host, but outbreaks have not reached the severe levels sustained elsewhere (27). Occasionally, localized outbreaks result in increased stand growth as mortality of subordinate trees ""thin"" an overdense stand (59,60). The western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) is the most destructive defoliator in western North America, causing serious damage in Canada and the Rocky Mountains and Pacific coast regions of the United States. Some outbreaks are short lived, but some continue for 20 years or more. Although initial damage is to new foliage and buds, trees can be completely defoliated in 4 to 5 years. Ultimate damage ranges from minor growth loss to major tree mortality over extensive areas, depending on severity and duration of the outbreak (27). A similar species, the Modoc budworm (Choristoneura retiniana [= viridis]), is endemic to the Warner Mountains of northeastern California and southeastern Oregon. Damage to California white fir in the Warner Range has been sporadic and light (27). The New Mexico fir looper (Galenara consimilis) is restricted to New Mexico and can be a serious problem locally on white fir. Weevils of the genus Agronus attack foliage of young trees and may cause concern with intensive forest management. Sawflies (Neodiprion spp.) are generally not a problem-but are potentially damaging in dense stands of young fir. In California, a species of Neodiprion sawfly has reached epidemic levels locally on white fir. White fir needleminer (Epinotia meritana) covers the full range of white fir and can cause extensive branch kill predisposing trees to bark beetle (Scolytus) attack (27). Cutworms (Noctuidae) can be a problem in nurseries and, more especially, in natural regeneration areas. Cutworms have been responsible for more than 30 percent of the seedling mortality in California (21,28). The most damaging white fir pest is the fir engraver beetle (Scolytus ventralis). This bark beetle is found over the entire range of white fir and causes serious damage nearly everywhere. Mortality equivalent to an estimated 2.4 million m³ (430 million fbm) of growing stock is caused each year in California alone. Losses during epidemics are even larger (27). The fir engraver can attack any tree, but those suffering from root rot infections or tussock moth attack are especially vulnerable. In general, anything that reduces tree vigor, such as mistletoes, Cytospora, drought, or fire, increases susceptibility to attack (20). Several other bark beetles-including one species of Pseudohylesinus and two species of Scolytus, the roundheaded borer (Tetropium abietis) and the flatheaded fir borer (Melanophila drummondi)- frequently join the fir engraver in attacking and killing individual trees. In epidemic conditions, however, mortality is primarily caused by the fir engraver. Maintenance of stand health and vigor is the only known control (27). Locally, small rodents can cause significant loss of seed and occasionally girdle seedlings. Pocket gophers limit regeneration in many areas, particularly clearcuts, by feeding on fir seedlings during winter and spring. Pocket gophers in combination with meadow voles and heavy brush can prevent conifer establishment for decades (21,37). Pocket gopher damage occurs on trees of all ages and sizes. Feeding on root tissues at the root crown has girdled saplings up to 12.7 cm (5 in) in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.). In at least one place, such feeding has resulted in death of mature trees up to 93.7 cm (36.9 in) d.b.h. (32). Direct control of pocket gopher is difficult and expensive. Indirect control by habitat manipulation offers some possibilities. Spring browsing of succulent growth by deer and other big game animals can retard height growth for many years. Normally, trees are not killed, and most can grow rapidly once browsing pressure is removed. In managed stands, however, reduced height growth can result in significant economic loss. Damage by big game can be severe in the Southwest. Damage from livestock grazing is limited primarily to trampling and appears to be decreasing as the number of cattle on the open range decreases (37).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,14,1
"Throughout its natural range, white fir grows on a variety of soils developed from almost every kind of parent material. These materials include recent volcanic and igneous rocks of nearly all compositions, large areas of intrusives (mostly granites), and various metamorphics, including serpentine. Sedimentary materials range from limestone, sandstone, and shale to unconsolidated Pleistocene lake deposits (5,21,22). These soils fall into the Inceptisol, Entisol, Alfisol, and Ultisol soil orders. Alfisols are most frequently found at the lower elevations in California where white fir is a component of the Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer Type. White fir is generally tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, nutrient availability, and pH values. It seems to be more dependent on moisture availability and temperature than on soil series. In at least one area of summer-dry Mediterranean climate, productive stands of white fir may utilize water obtained from shattered or otherwise porous bedrock well below the maximum soil depth (8). Growth and development are best on moderately deep and well-drained sandy-loam to clay-loam soils, regardless of parent material. High-elevation fir forests respond strongly to nitrogen fertilizer because low temperatures inhibit decay and natural release of nitrogen from the forest floor (49). California white fir is moderately sensitive to excess soil moisture and invades high-elevation meadows by growing near older lodgepole pine, taking advantage of relatively dry ground created by the pine roots. A similar pattern of meadow invasion can develop where radiational heat loss on clear, cold nights is significant. In these situations, the frost-sensitive fir is protected by the pine foliage. The species grows on various types of terrain, including the extremely steep and unstable slopes of the geologically young Coast Ranges in northwestern California. It develops best on gentle slopes and level ground. Elevations range from a minimum of 600 m (1,970 ft) in the headwaters of the Willamette River of central Oregon to a maximum of almost 3400 m (11,150 ft) east of the continental divide in central Colorado. Lower and upper elevational limits increase from north to south and from west to east as temperatures, distance from the Pacific Ocean, or both increase. Most California white fir in the Sierra Nevada is found at elevations between 1200 and 2100 m (3,900 and 6,900 ft). It grows at elevations of 1500 to 3000 m (4,900 to 9,800 ft) in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California. Rocky Mountain white fir is found most frequently at elevations between 2100 and 2700 m (6,900 and 8,900 ft) (21,22,47).",Soils and Topography,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,15,1
"White fir is a general, all-purpose, construction-grade wood used extensively for solid construction framing and plywood. A significant portion of the Christmas trees used in California are young white fir. These trees are harvested from natural stands, from regeneration areas where the trees are cultured for as long as 11 years before harvest, and from areas used specifically for Christmas tree production. Detailed and exact wildlife censuses for large areas do not exist, and any listing of species numbers associated with a major forest type is an approximation. There are, however, about 123 species of birds found in the white fir type of California, 50 of which are associated primarily with mature forests. Perhaps because of the dense nature of most true fir forests in California, there are only 33 species of mammals commonly present and of these only 7 are generally associated with mature forests. Reptiles are represented by 17 species, mostly at lower elevations. Only eight are regularly associated with mature forests (58).",Special Uses,White Fir,abies,concolor,conifer,16,1

"Flowering and Fruiting- White oak flowers in the spring at about the same time leaves appear. The time may vary from late March to late May depending upon latitude. It is monoecious; flowers of both sexes are present on the same tree. The yellowish staminate flowers appear first and are home in 5- to 8-cm (2- to 3-in) catkins. The reddish pistillate flowers appear 5 to 10 days later either singly or in pairs on short stalks. Female flowers that are not fertilized abscise during the development period. High abscission rates are common and may be related to weather conditions during the period of pollination, ovule development, and fertilization (44). Ripe anthers open and close with changes in relative humidity. Normally, pollen dissemination is completed within 3 days but periods of wet weather delay pollen shedding. Dry winds and freezing weather are also detrimental to flower development and pollen shedding (28). Acorn crops are good in years when the weather is warm for 10 days during flowering and then cool for 13 to 20 days afterward. The acorn crop has been poor in years when cool periods preceded warm periods at the time of flowering (36). Acorn maturity is reached approximately 120 days after pollination. Acorn drop follows 25 days later and is complete within a month. Physiological maturity, as indicated by normal germination, is reached when acorns change color from green to light brown (4). Acorns germinate almost immediately after falling to the ground in September or October. Seed Production and Dissemination- White oak can produce seeds prolifically, but good acorn crops are irregular and occur only every 4 to 10 years. Sometimes several years may pass without a crop. Acorn yields range from 0 to 500,000 acorns per hectare (202,000/acre) (7,22,28). This great variation in acorn production exists not only among isolated stands of oaks but also among individual trees within stands and from year to year. Trees normally bear seeds between the ages of 50 and 200 years, sometimes older; however, opengrown trees may produce seeds as early as 20 years. Individual white oak trees tend to have either very good or very poor seed crops and are noticeably consistent in seed production from year to year (20,28,36,40). A recent study (13) showed that white oak flower production varies not only annually but also among trees within a given year and that much of the variation in acorn production can be related to flower abundance at the time of pollination. More than 23,000 acorns were produced during a good seed year by an individual white oak tree growing in Virginia; it was 69 years old, 63.5 cm (25 in) in d.b.h., and 21 in (69 ft) tall, and had a crown area of 145 m² (1,560 ft²) . Average production in good years for individual forest-grown trees, however, is probably no more than 10,000 acorns. Several studies have shown that only a small portion of the total mature acorn crop (sometimes only 18 percent) is sound and fully developed; the remainder is damaged or destroyed by animals and insects (15,28,40). However, some damaged acorns germinate if the embryo is not damaged. Light acorn crops are often completely destroyed by animals and insects, so seedlings are produced only during heavy crop years. Seeds are disseminated by rodents (chiefly squirrels and mice), gravity, and wind. The area seeded by individual trees is small and therefore widespread reproduction depends on adequate distribution of seedbearing trees. Seedling Development- Germination is hypogeal. Sound white oak acorns have a germination capacity between 50 and 99 percent (30). Seeds germinate in the fall soon after dropping, requiring no pretreatment for germination. For germination to occur, the moisture content of acorns must not fall below 30 to 50 percent. Germination is favored at soil temperatures between 10° and 16° C (50° and 60° F). Germination is severely limited after 15 days of exposure to flooded conditions (1). When acorns germinate, their roots begin to grow but the shoot remains dormant. This trait serves to protect it from damage by freezing (11). After germination, root growth continues until interrupted by cold weather. Broken radicles are replaced on freshly sprouted seeds. Root and shoot growth resumes in the spring, and after the first growing season, seedlings 7.6 to 10.2 cm (3 to 4 in) high normally develop a large taproot 6 to 13 mm (0.25 to 0.50 in) in diameter and more than 30.5 em (12 in) long. Oak seedling establishment is best on loose soil because the radicle cannot penetrate excessively compact surfaces. A humus layer is especially important because it keeps the soil surface loose and porous and because it mechanically supports the acorn as the radicle penetrates the soil (28). If climate and soil are favorable for germination, white oak reproduces adequately from seed when: (1) large seed trees are within about 61 m (200 ft); (2) litter cover is light to moderate (but not thick); and (3) light reaching seedling level is at least 35 percent of full sunlight. Reproduction is least abundant on moist sites that have a thick carpet of ferns and lesser vegetation (6). Seedlings persist more readily in open stands typical of dry exposures but can be maintained on moist sites if adequate sunlight reaches the forest floor. Although important, soil moisture is probably not a critical factor in determining early seedling survival except under unusually dry conditions. At least one study has shown that when available soil moisture was 19 percent of oven dry soil weight, white oak seedling survival was 98 percent; at 3 percent available moisture, survival was 87 percent (28). A Missouri study has shown that despite an adequate crop of sound acorns, the number of new white oak seedlings produced in any given year is low compared to other oaks, particularly black oak Quercus velutina). However, these individuals may persist in the understory for many years (90 years) by repeatedly dying back and resprouting. This phenomenon permits the gradual buildup of advance reproduction that is often taller and more numerous than the advance reproduction of associated oaks. Under ideal growing conditions it is common for individual seedlings to grow 0.6 m (2 ft) or more a year. However, white oak seedlings established at the time of overstory removal normally grow too slowly to be of value in stand reproduction. Mean height of seedlings 10 years after overstory removal on sites with a site index of 13 to 19 in (43 to 63 ft) at base age 50 years in Missouri was slightly more than 0.6 m (2 ft) while seedling sprouts and stump sprouts averaged 4.9 and 6.4 m (16 and 21 ft), respectively (27). Vegetative Reproduction- Small white oak trees sprout prolifically and vigorously when cut or damaged by fire. The ability to sprout depends on the d.b.h. of the parent trees as follows (23): Shoot elongation of stump sprouts increases with increasing stump diameter up to 15 cm (6 in) after which it declines. Annual height growth of stump sprouts when overstory competition is removed averages 0.7 ni (2.2 ft) (24). Another source of vegetative reproduction is seedling sprouts. Seedling sprouts are stems with root systems that are several to many years older. These develop as a result of repeated dieback or mechanical damage. In general, low stump sprouts from pole-size trees and seedling sprouts are about as good as trees grown from seed. However, sprouts originating high on the stump are likely to have heartwood decay (28). The seedlings and seedling sprouts already present in a mature stand (advance reproduction), together with stump sprouts, regenerate the stand with oaks following overstory removal. Although many stands may have adequate numbers of stems, the size of the reproduction when the overstory is removed is the key to adequate growth and subsequent stocking (31). A minimum of 1,095 stems per hectare (443/acre) that are 1.37 m (4.5 ft) tall or taller is required to ensure a future stocking of at least 546 dominant and codominant oaks per hectare (221/acre) when average stand diameter is 7.6 cm (3 in) (33). Nevertheless, stands deficient in advance reproduction may be adequately stocked if a sufficient number of stumps sprout.",Reproduction and Early Growth,White Oak,quercus,alba,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- White oak is a large, long-lived tree often 24 to 30 ni (80 to 100 ft) in height and 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in) in d.b.h. Individual trees 46 m (150 ft) high, 244 cm (96 in) in d.b.h., and 600 years old have been recorded. In the open it is characterized by a short stocky bole with a widespreading rugged crown. In the forest, white oaks develop a tall straight trunk with a compact crown (28). White oak generally has the reputation of being a slow-growing tree. According to growth averages from Forest Resources Evaluation data in the Central States, 10-year d.b.h. growth of white oak was 3.0 cm (1.20 in) for seedlings and saplings, 3.5 cm (1.37 in) for poles, and 4.7 cm (1.84 in) for sawtimber. These growth rates were slower than scarlet oak Quercus coccinea), northern red oak (Q. rubra), or black oak but faster than chestnut oak (Q. prinus). Among the non-oak species only hickory and beech had slower growth rates than white oak, while yellow-poplar, black walnut (Juglans nigra), white ash, and sugar maple all had faster growth rates than white oak (16). Although white oak was once a component of mixed, uneven-aged stands, most white oaks today are in pure to mixed second growth stands of sprout origin. Individual trees may contain 5.7 m³ (1,000 fbm) or more of wood but this is uncommon. Pure and mixed unthinned stands at age 80 normally contain from 28 to 168 m³/ha (2,000 to 12,000 fbm/acre) of wood, occasionally more. Mean annual volume growth over a 60-year period in these stands ranges from 0.95 m³/ha on fair to poor sites to 2.2 m³/ha on good sites (68 fbm/acre to 156 fbm/acre) (17). Total volumes of fully stocked, even-aged stands of mixed oak have been reported to be 89.3 m³/ha (6,380 ft³/acre) at age 100 on site index 24.4 m (80 ft) sites; and merchantable volumes of 294 m³/ha (21,000 fbm/acre) have been found in stands on comparable sites in Wisconsin at age 100. However, such high volumes are rare and occur in localized areas (28). Because oaks in general, and white oak specifically, are long-lived trees, rotation length can be long (120+ years). But rotation lengths can be shortened by as much as 50 percent and yields increased dramatically if stands are thinned early and regularly, particularly on good sites. If thinnings are begun at age 10 and stands rethinned to 60 percent stocking at 10-year intervals, volume yield at age 60 on good sites (264 m³/ha or 18,840 fbm/acre) is approximately double that in similar unthinned stands. Mean annual growth in such thinned stands is 3.9 m³/ha (279 fbm/acre) (17). Throughout its range, site index for white oak is generally less than for yellow-poplar and other important oaks on the same site (26,28). White oak site index is approximately 1.2 ni (4 ft) less than black oak and 2.1 in (7 ft) less than scarlet oak. On all sites the index for white oak is higher than that for shortleaf pine. And on the poorest sites, the index for white oak is higher than that for yellow-poplar. Rooting Habit- White oak is deep rooted-a trait that persists from youth to maturity. White oak seedlings produce a conspicuous, well-developed taproot but this gradually disappears with age and is replaced by a fibrous root system with well-developed, tapered laterals. Although the deepest point of root penetration observed during a study conducted at the Harvard Black Rock Forest in Massachusetts approached 1.2 m (4 ft), most of the main branches away from the central stem were within 53.3 cm (21 in) of the ground surface. Fine roots are typically concentrated in dense mats in the upper soil horizons usually close to trunks but occasionally lying beneath the base of neighboring trees (5,14,39). Root grafts between neighboring trees are common, especially under crowded conditions. The ratio between the area of the root system and the area of the crown ranges from 3.4 to 1 to 5.8 to 1. Following stand thinning, roots of released trees are capable of elongating at the rate of 0.24 m (0.8 ft) per year. Root regeneration of young forest-grown seedlings may be hampered following top damage. A study of root regeneration of 1-0 white oak seedlings growing under greenhouse conditions has shown that new growth of seedlings whose shoot tops were pruned was 20 to 80 percent less than that of unpruned seedlings (12). Reaction to Competition- White oak is generally classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. It is most tolerant in youth and becomes less tolerant as the tree becomes larger. White oak seedlings, saplings, and even pole-size trees are nevertheless able to persist under a forest canopy for more than 90 years. Saplings and pole-size trees respond well to release. A 41 percent increase in diameter has resulted in young stands 1 year following release, and this trend has continued through the fourth year following release. Moreover, diameter growth of released trees for a 20-year period can be expected to be double that of nonreleased trees. Release significantly increases height growth only for those trees in the intermediate or suppressed crown classes. Young white oak sprout clumps thinned to one stem show a slightly greater diameter growth response over released single-stemmed trees (8,28,29). Such increases are possible when stands are heavily thinned, but the response becomes less dramatic as residual stand stocking increases. Other things being equal, however, the trees to release should be the large potential crop trees that show evidence of rapid recent growth. Thinning combined with fertilization can boost 2-year diameter growth by 95 percent over unthinned and unfertilized pole-size white oak according to tests conducted in the Boston Mountains of Arkansas (19). The addition of nitrogen and calcium to soils in the Allegheny Plateau region of central Pennsylvania increased stand volume more than 40 percent (42). White oak usually becomes dominant in the stand because of its ability to persist for long periods of time in the understory, its ability to respond well after release, and its great longevity. When associated with other oaks and hickory in the central and southern hardwood forests, white oak is considered a climax tree. On good sites in the north, it is usually succeeded by sugar maple. In the Ozark-Ouachita Highlands, white oak is climax on moderately dry to moist sites. In sheltered, moist coves and well-drained second bottoms throughout its range it may be succeeded by beech and other more tolerant species (10). Most research and field experience suggest that even-aged silviculture is most suitable for white oak growing in pure or mixed hardwood stands. Although selection silviculture has been considered, it has been difficult to develop a sustainable stand structure without continual cultural treatments to restrain the more tolerant species, particularly on the better sites (34). If oak advance reproduction is adequate, clearcutting is the recommended silvicultural system (32). if oak advance reproduction is scarce or absent, new seedlings need to be established. Some reduction of overstory density should help to stimulate seed production, but because of the periodicity of seed crops, it will probably take a long time to establish an adequate number of new seedlings. Seedlings can be planted under an overstory and allowed to develop. The overstory should be maintained at about 60 percent stocking and if competition from an existing understory will impair the growth of the planted seedlings, its density should be reduced. Planting oaks after clearcutting has generally been unsatisfactory because the planted seedlings do not grow fast enough to compete with new sprouts. Reducing both overstory and understory competition is likely to accelerate the growth of small oak advance reproduction. However, even with this increased growth, advance oak reproduction grows slowly and the development period may be from 10 to 20 years or longer. Natural pruning of white oak is usually good in moderately to heavily stocked stands. Large dominant trees have cleaner boles than smaller trees in lower crown classes. Some branches along the trunk tend to persist when exposed to sunlight. Epicormic sprouting may be heavy on trees that have been grown in fully stocked stands for 20 years or more and then given sudden and heavy release (28). However, residual stand density and the vigor of trees may be more important to the persistence of epicormics than to their initiation following thinning (41). Significantly more epicormic branches have been observed on multiple-stemmed trees than on single-stemmed trees. Live branches not more than 4 cm (1.5 in) in d.b.h. may be saw-pruned without danger of introducing rot. However, epicormic sprouts will often develop around the edges of the wound on saplings and small pole-size trees. Diameter growth of thinned and pruned trees may be 10 percent less than thinned but unpruned trees (35). Damaging Agents- Several insects attack white oak trees (15,28,43). They are usually not important but may become epidemic and kill weakened trees. Economically, the most important are the wood borers. These may damage the wood of standing trees and cause log and lumber defects. White oak is attacked by several leaf eaters including the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), orange-striped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), variable oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), several oak leaf tiers (Psilocorsis spp.), and walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata). Frequently trees are killed from an interaction of damaging agents such as a defoliator followed by invasion of a shoestring fungus and the twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus). White oak also hosts various scale insects, gall-forming insects, and twig pruners, but most of these are of minor importance. White oak acorns are commonly attacked by insects, in some cases affecting half the total acorn crop. Weevils of the genera Curculio and Conotrachelus cause most acorn damage. Light acorn crops usually are more heavily infested than heavy ones. Two moths damage acorns, the filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus) and Valentinia glandulella. The Cynipid wasps cause galls to develop in the acorn or on the cup. The oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus) frequently damages white oak, making it unfit for tight cooperage. Attacks by this insect usually occur at wounds made by logging, lightning, and wind. Golden oak scale (Asterolecanium variolosum) can seriously damage and even kill the tree. It is especially damaging when accompanied by drought. Decay of heartwood resulting from fire scars causes the most serious white oak losses. The amount of decay depends on the size of the wound, the species of fungi, and the length of time since wounding. In general, rot spreads in the stem if the basal sear is more than 0.3 m (1 ft) in d.b.h. The larger the wound, the faster the rot (28). Oak wilt, a vascular disease caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum, is potentially the most destructive disease of both the red and white oaks. It is widely distributed throughout the Central States. White oak is less susceptible to oak wilt than the red oak species, and may lose only a limb at a time, or may sustain infection by the pathogen without ever showing symptoms (21). Several other diseases of white oak seldom kill or cause much loss. Perennial cankers induced by bark diseases Strumella coryneoides and Nectria galligena are responsible for most of the losses in white oak particularly where ice and snow accumulation is common. Damage results from a weakening of the bole at the cankers with subsequent wind breakage. The trunk can become wholly or partially unmerchantable. A root rot caused by the fungus Armillaria mellea attacks weakened trees. Root rot caused by Armillaria tabescens is similar and attacks oaks in the South. White root rot caused by Inonotus dryadeus is common on weak and suppressed trees. The fungus Gnomonia veneta causes irregular brown areas on leaves and shoots. It may cause loss of some leaves and rarely, complete defoliation. Oak leaf blister, caused by Taphrina caerulescens, is prevalent on eastern oaks, producing blisterlike swellings on the foliage. White oak is moderately resistant to ice breakage, sensitive to flooding, and resistant to salt spray and brief salt-water submergence (21,28). It is sensitive to fire injury but less so than scarlet oak. Coal smoke and the resulting fly ash deposit on the soil surface substantially reduce white oak productivity (2,38).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,White Oak,quercus,alba,hardwood,14,0
"White oak grows on a wide range of soils and sites. It is found on podzols, gray-brown podzolic soils, brown podzolic soils, red and yellow podzolic soils, lithosols, planasols, and alluviums. The tree grows on both glaciated and nonglaciated soils derived from many parent materials. It is found on sandy plains, gravelly ridges, rich uplands, coves, and well-drained loamy soils. Growth is good on all but the driest, shallowest soils (28). Mineral nutrition is not limiting to white oak growth except on very sandy soils where moisture is also a limiting factor. The amount of variability in white oak growth that can be accounted for by soil factors alone is low (9,28,37). Nevertheless, several studies have identified the more important factors to be thickness of the A, and A2 horizons and the percent clay in the surface soils (18,25,28). White oak is most frequently found growing on soils in the orders Alfisols and Ultisols. The major site factors influencing white oak growth are latitude, aspect, and topography (9,18). White oak has the ability to grow on all upland aspects and slope positions within its range except extremely dry, shallow-soil ridges; poorly drained flats; and wet bottom land. It grows best on north and east-facing lower slopes and coves and grows well on moderately dry slopes and ridges with shallow soils. White oak is more abundant although smaller in size on the drier west- and south-facing slopes than on the more mesophytic sites. It is found at all altitudes in the central and southern parts of its range, but it is seldom found above 150 in (500 ft) in elevation in the northern part of its range. It is excluded from the high Appalachians in New York and New England; but it is a scrub tree at elevations of 1370 in (4,500 ft) in the southern Appalachians (28).",Soils and Topography,White Oak,quercus,alba,hardwood,15,0
"Acorns are a valuable though inconsistent source of wildlife food. More than 180 different kinds of birds and mammals use oak acorns as food; among them are squirrels, blue jays, crows, red-headed woodpeckers, deer, turkey, quail, mice, chipmunks, ducks, and raccoons. White oak twigs and foliage are browsed by deer especially in clearcuts less than 6 years old (3). White oak is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree because of its broad round crown, dense foliage, and purplish-red to violet-purple fall coloration. It is less favored than red oak because it is difficult to transplant and has a slow growth rate.",Special Uses,White Oak,quercus,alba,hardwood,16,0
"Eastern Forest- The forest cover type White Spruce (Society of American Foresters Type 107) (40) is found in either pure stands or mixed stands in which white spruce is the major component. Associated species include black spruce, paper birch (Betula papyrifera), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), red spruce (Picea rubens), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) are sometimes included in the community mix. The type is minor and confined to abandoned fields in New England and the Maritime Provinces, and within the fog belt farther north in Quebec and Labrador. It is more widespread elsewhere in eastern Canada and as far north as the tree line in Ungava and along Hudson Bay. In northern Quebec, the lichen (Cladonia) woodland, the feathermoss forest, and the shrub forest with bog birch (B. nana) and heath species are common white spruce communities. White spruce is an associated species in the following Eastern Forest cover types: Boreal Forest Region1 Jack Pine 5 Balsam Fir 12 Black Spruce 16 Aspen 18 Paper Birch 38 Tamarack Northern Forest Region15 Red Pine 21 Eastern White Pine 24 Hemlock-Yellow Birch 25 Sugar Maple-Beech-Yellow Birch 27 Sugar Maple 30 Red Spruce-Yellow Birch 32 Red Spruce 33 Red Spruce-Balsam Fir 37 Northern White-Cedar 39 Black Ash-American Elm-Red Maple In three of these types, Aspen (Type 16), Paper Birch (Type 18), and Red Pine (Type 15), white spruce attains increasing importance in the stand composition as the succession progresses and more tolerant species take over. Western Forest- White Spruce (Type 201) is the pure white spruce forest in the West. In Alaska and the Northwest Territories, the type is largely confined to stream bottoms, river floodplains and terraces, and warm, south-facing upland sites. Farther south in British Columbia and Alberta, it has broader distribution from as low as 760 m (2,500 ft) to 1520 m (5,000 ft). Associated tree species in Alaska include paper birch, quaking aspen, black spruce, and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). In Western Canada, subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), balsam fir, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and lodgepole pine (P. contorta) are important associates. The type varies little and generally comprises closed stands. White spruce plant communities in interior Alaska include white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/ avens (Dryas)/moss; and white spruce/alder (Alnus spp.)/blue-joint (Calamagrostis canadensis) (32,43, 61). Two communities are common in northwestern Canada and in Alaska: (1) white spruce/willow (Salix spp.)/buffaloberry (Shepherdia spp.)/northern goldenrod (Solidago multiradiata)/crowberry (Empetrum spp.) and (2) white spruce/willow/buffaloberry/huckleberry (Gaylussacia spp.)/dewberry (Rubus spp.)/peavine (Lathyrus spp.). In White Spruce-Aspen (Type 251), either species may be dominant, but each species must make up at least 20 percent of the total basal area. Paper birch and black spruce may also be represented in Alaskan stands along with balsam fir and lodgepole pine in Canadian stands. The type is common throughout western Canada at lower elevations and in all of interior Alaska. Associated shrubs in Alaska are American green alder (Alnus crispa), willows, common bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), soapberry, highbush cranberry (Viburnum edule), and mountain cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Associated shrubs in the Prairie Provinces are common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), and western chokecherry (Prunus virginiana var. demissa). White Spruce-Paper Birch (Type 202) is defined similarly to White Spruce-Aspen in that either spruce or birch may be dominant as long as each species makes up at least 20 percent of the basal area. Aspen, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, and black spruce are associated species. The type is common in Western Canada and in Alaska from the Arctic Circle to the Kenai Peninsula. Undergrowth species include willow, American green alder, highbush cranberry, prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), mountain cranberry, bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), and Labrador-tea (Ledum groenlandicum). Whereas White Spruce-Aspen and White Spruce-Paper Birch are successional stages leading to the pure White Spruce type, Black Spruce-White Spruce (Type 253) may be a climax near the altitudinal and northern treeline. But black spruce may be replacing white spruce on some intermediate sites on older river terraces (160). Black Spruce-White Spruce is the lichen-woodland type from Hudson Bay to northwestern Alaska along the treeline as well as in open stands at alpine treeline sites in interior Alaska and northwestern Canada. It is also found on sites intermediate to the two species, such as older terraces above the floodplain. Paper birch, tamarack (Larix laricina), balsam poplar, aspen, and balsam fir may be found within the stands. In open stands near the treeline, resin birch (Betula glandulosa), alder, and willows may form a continuous shrub cover that on drier sites may be replaced by mats of feathermosses and Cladonia lichens. Labrador-tea, bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), mountain cranberry, and black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) are other common shrubs within the type. In addition to these three tree cover types in which white spruce is a major component, the species is an associate in the following Western Forest cover types: 203 Balsam Poplar 204 Black Spruce 206 Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir 217 Aspen 218 Lodgepole Pine 237 Interior Ponderosa Pine 252 Paper Birch 254 Black Spruce-Paper Birch Several of these types are intermediate in the succession. Paper Birch may advance through White Spruce-Paper Birch to pure White Spruce. Balsam Poplar (Type 203) is eventually overtopped and replaced by white spruce; on some sites the process is very slow. Aspen often precedes the more tolerant spruce and fir forests, and lodgepole pine may be replaced by white spruce in northern latitudes. In the Canadian boreal spruce-fir forest, American green alder is the most widespread tall shrub, with littletree willow (Salix arbusculoides), gray willow (S. glauca), and Bebb willow (S. bebbiana) important in the western range. Mountain maple (Acer spicatum), showy mountain-ash (Sorbus decora), and American mountain-ash (S. americana) are important in the East. Highbush cranberry, red currant (Ribes triste), prickly rose, and raspberry (Rubus idaeus) are the most common medium to low shrubs. The most wide-ranging members of the herb-dwarf shrub stratum are fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), one-sided wintergreen (Pyrola secunda), one-flowered wintergreen (Moneses uniflora), northern twinflower (Linnaea borealis), naked bishops-cap (Mitella nuda), bunchberry, dwarf rattlesnake-plantain (Goodyera repens), stiff clubmoss (Lycopodium annotinum), and horsetail (Equisetum spp.) (91). An average of 24 bryophytes (17 mosses and 7 liverworts) occur in Canadian white spruce-fir stands (92). The most common mosses are Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens, Ptilium cristacastrensis, Dicranum fuscescens, and Drepanocladus uncinatus. The most common liverworts are Ptilidium pulcherrimum, R. ciliare, Lophozia spp., and Blepharostoma trichophyllum. Some common lichens are Peltigera apthosa, P. canina, Cladonia rangiferina, C. sylvatica, C. alpestris, C. gracilis, and Cetraria islandica.",Associated Forest Cover,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,1,1
"White spruce has been described as a, ""plastic"" species because of its ability to repopulate areas at the end of glaciation. It grows under highly variable conditions, including extreme climates and soils. In the north, the position of the tree line has been correlated to various factors, including the 10° C (50° F) isotherm for mean July temperature, cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean net radiation (especially during the growing season), and low light intensities (see review 39). None of the variables strictly define the northern limit of spruce, and in northern Alaska the presence of mountainous topography makes it difficult to determine controlling factors (26). Other biotic and abiotic variables affecting the northern and altitudinal distribution include lack of soil, low fertility, low soil temperature, fire, insects, disease, human impact, soil stability, and others (39,158,159). The southern limit of the belt in which white spruce forms more than 60 percent of the total stand roughly follows the 18° C (64° F) July isotherm. The association is particularly close northeast of Lake Superior; in the Prairie Provinces, the species' limit swings north of the isotherm. At the northern limit of the species' range, climatic extremes are significant. For example, -54° C (-65° F) in January and 34° C (94° F) in July were recorded extremes in one study area (102,158). Mean daily temperatures of -29° C (-20° F) for January are recorded throughout the species' range in Alaska, Yukon, and Northwest Territories, while mean daily July temperatures range from about 21° C (70° F) in the extreme southeastern area of distribution to 13° C (55° F) throughout much of Alaska and Canada. Maximum temperatures as high as 43° C (110° F) have been recorded within the range in Manitoba. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1270 mm (50 in) in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to 250 mm (10 in) through the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and parts of Alaska. Conditions are most severe, however, along the southern edge of distribution through Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, where a mean annual precipitation of from 380 to 510 mm (15 to 20 in) coincides with mean July daily temperature maxima of 24° C (75° F) or more. The growing season ranges from about 180 days in parts of Maine to about 20 days in parts of Canada. Generally, however, white spruce grows in regions where the growing season exceeds 60 days (108). Photoperiod varies continuously over the range of the species from approximately 17 hours at summer solstice along the southern edge of the species' distribution to 24 hours north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska and parts of northern Canada.",Climate,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,2,1
"No races of white spruce are recognized, but four varieties have been named: Picea glauca, Picea glauca var. albertiana, Picea glauca var. densata, and Picea glauca var. porsildii. It seems unnecessary to distinguish varieties, however (23,96). White and Engelmann spruce are sympatric over large areas in British Columbia, Montana, and Wyoming. White spruce predominates at lower elevations (up to 1520 m or 5,000 ft), and Engelmann spruce predominates at higher elevations (over 1830 m or 6,000 ft). The intervening slopes support a swarm of hybrids between the two species; these hybrids are the type that gave rise to the so-called variety albertiana. Sitka and white spruce overlap in northwestern British Columbia and areas in Alaska. The hybrid Picea x lutzi Little occurs where the species are sympatric. The population in Skeena Valley has been studied in some detail. It represents a gradual transition from Sitka to white spruce, a hybrid swarm resulting from introgressive hybridization (20,130). Natural hybrids between black and white spruce are rare along the southern edge of the species' range, undoubtedly because female receptivity of the two species is asynchronous. A single occurrence from Minnesota has been described (97) and its hybrid origin definitely established (129). To the north, they are more common; intermediate types occur north of latitude 57° N. along the Alaskan highway in British Columbia (130). The hybrids have also been found along the treeline in the forest tundra (93). Many artificial hybrids have been produced (75,117); a few show some promise, but none has achieved commercial importance.",Hybrids,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,9,1
"White spruce has a transcontinental range, from Newfoundland and Labrador west across Canada along the northern limit of trees to Hudson Bay, Northwest Territories, and Yukon. It almost reaches the Arctic Ocean at latitude 69° N. in the District of Mackenzie in the Northwest Territories (149). In Alaska, it reaches the Bering Sea at Norton Bay and the Gulf of Alaska at Cook Inlet. In British Columbia, it comes within 100 km (60 mi) of the Pacific Ocean in the Skeena Valley where it overlaps with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), and from there it extends south through British Columbia, and east through Alberta and Manitoba to Lake Winnipeg and south and east through northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, central Michigan, northeastern New York, and Maine. The contiguous distribution shown extending south in the Rocky Mountains into Montana actually may be outliers similar to those found further south in Montana, in the Black Hills in Wyoming and South Dakota (approximately latitude 44° N.), and at Cypress Hills in Saskatchewan (149). White spruce grows from sea level to about 1520 m (5,000 ft) elevation. It is found near 610 m (2,000 ft) on the central tableland of Labrador north of latitude 52° N. (108), and in Alaska white spruce forests approach 910 m (3,000 ft) at about latitude 68° N. in the Dietrich River Valley on the south slope of the Brooks Range (26). It reaches 1160 m (3,800 ft) in the timberline forest at latitude 61° N. in the Liard Range in the Northwest Territories (79), and farther south in the Rocky Mountains it is the dominant species from the edge of the plains at 1220 m (4,000 ft) to about 1520 m (5,000 ft). In interior British Columbia, white spruce grows at elevations as low as 760 m (2,500 ft) in the east Kootenay Valley (130). - The native range of white spruce.",Native Range,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,11,1
"White spruce is highly variable over its range; the variation pattern is clinal and generally follows the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. As an example, southern provenances are the fastest growing and the latest flushing when tested near the southern edge of the range; Alaskan trees are dwarfs and are susceptible to spring frost because they flush early. Soil-related adaptive variation has been demonstrated, and variation in germination temperature requirements have also been described (117). Because the species shows such strong adaptive affinity to local environments, seed collection and seed and seedling distribution must adhere to seed zoning and seed transfer rules. Variation in monoterpenes, DNA content, and taxonomic characteristics suggest two major populations-one in the East, east of longitude 95° W., and another in the West. Further subdivision of these populations must await new research (117). Two high-yielding provenances have been identified. In the East, a source centered around Beachburg and Douglas in the Ottawa River Valley about 97 km (60 mi) northwest of Ottawa has proven superior in the Lake States, New England, and southern portions of the range in eastern Canada (96). In the West, the Birch Island provenance (lat. 51° 37' N., long. 119° 51' W., elev. 425 m (1,400 ft)) has been exceptional. In coastal nurseries, it will grow as fast as Sitka spruce. Provisional seed zones have been summarized for Canada (141) and are being developed for Alaska. In the Lake States, general zones have been developed, and superior and also inferior seed sources identified (113,135). Tentative seed transfer rules have been suggested for British Columbia. They limit altitudinal movement to 150 m (500 ft) and suggest that high-elevation spruce provenances from southern latitudes can be moved 2 to 3 degrees of latitude. They also warn that a transfer north of more than 3 degrees will probably result in a detrimental silvicultural effect in southern provenances from low elevations (131). Analysis of enzyme patterns is providing new information on population structure that can be used for improving and refining seed management practices for reforestation (2,17,20). Hybrids between provenances have been tested on a small scale with promising preliminary results (179). Constructing seed orchards of mixed provenances or of selected alien trees and selection from the local provenance could be an inexpensive approach to increasing yields.",Population Differences,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,12,1
"Flowering and Fruiting- White spruce is monoecious. Reproductive buds are differentiated at the time shoot growth ceases, the year before flowering and seed dispersal (35,118). The process lasts about a week. In British Columbia, it occurs during the last 2 weeks of July over a wide range of sites; this suggests that it may occur at about the same time throughout much of the species' range. Development of reproductive buds continues for 2 to 2.5 months and coincides with shoot maturation. The male buds become dormant first (about October 1 at Prince George, BC) followed by the vegetative and female buds about 2 weeks, later (118). Cone-crop potential can be predicted in several ways. An early indication of a potential crop can be abnormally hot, dry weather at the time of bud differentiation, particularly if the current and preceding cone crops have been poor. Estimates of cone crop potential can be made by counting female reproductive buds in fall or winter. Differentiating male and female buds from vegetative buds is difficult, but the external morphology of the buds, and their distribution within the crown, enables the practiced observer to make the distinction (35). Female buds are concentrated in the top whorls. On 17-year-old grafts, the most productive was the 4th whorl from the top, and the productive zone averaged 6.4 whorls (112). In light crop years, the, highest cone concentration is closer to the top than in intermediate or heavy crop years. Male buds generally are located in the middle to lower crown (38). In the spring, renewed cell division and growth begin before the first evidence of bud elongation. In British Columbia, this is 6 weeks before pollination at low elevations and 8 weeks before pollination at high elevations (119). Meiosis takes place during this period about 3 weeks before maximum pollen shedding. Female receptivity coincides with pollen shedding and usually lasts from 3 to 5 days in May, June, or July depending on geographic location and climate. The southern areas definitely have earlier dispersal than northern areas; however, peak dispersal at latitude 48-50° and 65° N. can occur on the same calendar date (106,108,149,193). Pollination is delayed up to 5 weeks at higher elevations (119,193). The latest pollen dispersal occurs near elevational and latitudinal treeline.' The time of pollen shedding and female receptivity is undoubtedly temperature dependent and may vary as much as 4 weeks from year to year (44). Pollen dispersal shows a marked diurnal pattern dependent on temperature, humidity, and wind (193). The period of peak pollination and female receptivity is a critical stage in seed production and is easily disrupted by adverse weather such as rain and frost (102,106,181). Such events can seriously reduce a promising seed crop. Before pollen dispersal, male flowers are red and succulent; water can be squeezed from the conelet in a substantial drop. Moisture content (percentage of dry weight) was 500 to 600 percent greater than dry weight before pollen dispersal began and dropped precipitously as the male flower dried and pollen was dispersed. Just before shedding, the males are approximately 10 to 12 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) long. Then the color changes from red to yellow and the conelet is almost dry when squeezed. This is the ideal time for collecting pollen. After the pollen is shed, the structure turns brown and soon falls. At maximum receptivity, females are erect, 20 to 25 mm (0.8 to 1.0 in) long, and vary in color from green to deep red. Within an individual tree, the color is uniform. When receptive, the scales are widely separated, but they close shortly after pollination and the cones begin to turn down and gradually dull in color. Turning down takes from 2 to 4 weeks and occurs when the cone is growing most rapidly. Fertilization occurs from 3 to 4 weeks after pollination (103,119,128). Full size and maximum cone water content and fresh weight are attained in late June or early July. The final cone size may vary considerably from year to year (193); it is determined by the weather the previous season, weather during cone expansion, and heredity. The primary period of embryo growth occurs after cones attain maximum size. Cotyledons appear in middle to late July and embryo development is completed in early to late August (103,119,128,188). Seed development can vary as much as 3 weeks from year to year (33), and cotyledon initiation may differ from 1 to 3 weeks between high and low sites. Embryos have matured on the same date at both high and low elevations (119); however, there can be large differences among elevations in time of seed maturation (188). The maturation process evidently continues after embryos attain physical and anatomical maturity (33,177,183). Cone dry weight generally increases during this period. Weather is critical to the production of high quality seed. In high elevation and high latitude populations, immature seed with poorly developed embryos are produced during cold growing seasons (183,193). In general, seed quality is highest in years of heavy seed production and lowest in years of low seed production. Cones ripen in August or September from 2 to 3 months after pollen shedding (21,167,177,183). Cone opening coincides with moisture contents of from 45 to 70 percent and specific gravities of from 0.6 to 0.8 (21,177,193). Cone firmness, seed coat color, seed brittleness, and various flotation tests are indicators of cone and seed maturity (141). Cone color can also be used; but because female cone color can be red, pink, or green (153), no standardized cone color changes are associated with maturity. Most authorities agree on the importance of observing cones closely during the last stages of maturity so that the optimum collection period is not missed. White spruce seeds can be collected from 2 to 4 weeks before they ripen and seed quality improved by storing under cool (4° to 10° C (40° to 50° F)), ventilated conditions. Collection date and method of cone handling affect prechilling required for germination and early seedling growth. No specifics have been recommended for the best cone handling procedures (33,177,183). Seed Production and Dissemination- Cones and seeds have been produced by 4-year-old trees (149). Production ""in quantity"" on 10- to 15-year-old trees has been reported, but it is usually low in younger trees and depends on site and season. Seed production in quantity begins at age 30 or older for most natural stands (44,117). The interval between good to excellent cone and seed crops varies with site and geographic location. On good sites, good to excellent years can occur at 2- to 6-year intervals but may be as many as 10 to 12 years apart (88,167,184,192). Excellent seed years may be related to hot, dry summers at the time of bud differentiation (112). They are always followed by poor ones; the alternation can result from carbohydrate and nutrient deficiencies or the lack of sites in the crown able to produce reproductive buds (117). A mixture of gibberellins, GA4/7, has been found to substantially increase female flowering in white spruce (15,121). Treatment of elongating shoots was effective, but application to dormant shoots was not (16). Fertilization with ammonium nitrate has also been successful in promoting flowering (68). Both the initiation and pattern of seed dispersal depend on the weather. Cool, wet, or snowy weather delays the onset of dispersal and causes cones to close after dispersal has begun. Cones reopen during dry weather. A small number of seeds are usually dispersed in August, but most of the seeds fall in September (30,167,186,192,193). Early- and late-falling seeds have a lower viability than seeds falling during the peak period (167). Cones can remain on the tree from 1 to 2 years after the majority of seeds are dispersed. Cone opening and seed dispersal pattern can vary among trees in the same stand (186). Average weight per seed varies from 1.1 to 3.2 mg (0.02 to 0.05 grains) (64,193), and there are approximately 500,000 seeds per kilogram (226,000/lb) (155). From 8,000 to 12,000 cones may be produced by individual trees in good years. This corresponds to approximately 35 liters (1 bushel) or about 250,000 seeds (64). Yields in the far north are less (184). Cone production in mature spruce stands occurs primarily in dominant and codominant trees with sporadic and low production in intermediate and suppressed trees (167). The total number of seeds per cone varies significantly among trees and regions-from 32 to 130 have been reported (87,167,192). Seeds produced on the apical and basal scales are not viable; therefore, the number of viable seeds per cone is much lower-from 12 to 34 and from 22 to 61 full seeds per cone for open and control pollinations, respectively (87). Seed dispersal as measured by seed trapping varies with seed year and from day to day. In Manitoba, the maximum annual total seedfall was 1400/m² (130/ft²) , and 59 percent were filled. The seed rain exceeded 290/m² (26.9/ft²) in 5 of the 10 years, and 40 to 71 percent of these were filled; for 3 years it was less than 10/m² (0.9/ft²), and of these 2 to 36 percent were filled (167). In Alaska, maximum total seed rain in one stand over a 13-year period was 4,000 seeds/m² (371.7/ft²). Seed rain exceeded 1,000 seeds/m² (92.9/ft²) in 3 years and was between 400 and 500 seeds/m² (37.1 and 46.4/ft²) in 2 other years. In the remaining years, seed rain was less than 100/m² (9.3/ft²) (184). White spruce is primarily wind-dispersed, and the time in flight and distance of flight for individual seeds was variable and depended on conditions at the time of dispersal (191). The quantity of seed reaching a given area drops precipitously with distance from the seed source. At 50, 100, 200, and 300 m (162.5, 325.0, 650.0, 975.0 ft), seed rain may be as low as 7, 4, 0. 1, and 0. 1 percent of that in the stand. The actual percentage of seeds reaching various distances may vary among sites within a local area and among geographical areas (30,186). White spruce seed collection is expensive, but cost can be reduced by robbing the cone-caches of red squirrels. The viability of seed from cached cones does not vary between the time squirrels begin to cache cones in quantity and the time the last cones are cached (164). Viability drops to near zero, however, after 1 to 2 years of storage in a cone cache. White spruce rapidly regenerates the crown after topping, thereby restoring the seed-bearing capacity. In fact, topping may temporarily increase cone production (112). Therefore, it is possible to reduce seed collection costs more than three times by collecting from downed tops (138). Seedling Development- White spruce seed shows conditional dormancy that varies in response to temperature and light conditions and therefore can be modified by stratification or prechilling. Optimum germination temperatures are from 10° to 24° C (50° to 75° F); maximum germination temperature is between 29° and 35° C (84° and 95° F). Minimum constant temperature is 5° C (41° F), but most germination ceases below 10° C (50° F). A diurnal fluctuation in temperature may be favorable (27,47). Prechilling or stratification at 2° to 4° C (36° to 39° F) is recommended for testing seed lots and for improving germination capacity, energy, and survival in the nursery of spring-sown seed. Stratification is not always a prerequisite for complete germination, however (27,47,171,172,193). Germination is epigeal (155). The period of germination under field conditions is mid-May through early August. With adequate water, seeds germinate as soon as soil surface temperatures are warm enough. Generally, germination (natural seedfall or artificial seeding in fall) is 75 to 100 percent complete by early July. Some white spruce seeds are able to withstand several wetting and drying cycles without losing their viability (63,70,168,189). Germination of spring-sown seeds begins somewhat later than in fall-sown seeds but is complete in 3 to 4 weeks (24,34). Adverse conditions offset germination and may delay it to the following year. Germinants developing after the middle of July have a lower survival probability than those originating in early summer (18,49,62,67,193). White spruce is capable of reproducing under mature stands of spruce and early succession tree species; however, the response is highly variable and density and percent stocking are low (89,170). In Saskatchewan, for example, advanced regeneration was not present in 88 percent of the stands studied, and one-half of the remaining stands had less than 1,240 seedlings per hectare (500/acre) (84). On upland sites in interior Alaska, advanced regeneration ranged from 1 to 25 percent stocking and density from 120 to 640 stems per hectare (50 to 260/acre) (70). Regeneration under established stands, whether spruce or other species, occurs on a variety of seedbeds and commonly on rotted logs (25,164,168). Feathermosses (e.g., Hylocomium spp., Pleurozium spp.) and associated organic layers are the most common seedbed surfaces in mature stands (92). Where the L- and F-layers are greater than from 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in), they greatly restrict regeneration. This is particularly true in drier western regions. Although this limitation is most often attributed to low water retention, it may be chemical inhibition (allelopathy) caused by some forest floor components, particularly lichens (42). In mature stands, exposed mineral soil after windthrow and floods are the best seedbeds (29,70,165). They can have stocking levels approaching 100 percent. The average number of seeds required to produce a seedling on recently exposed mineral soil ranges from 5 to 30 (30,36,50,69,193). The seed requirement increases with each year after exposure of the soil because of increasing plant competition and litter accumulation (95). Receptivity of organic seedbeds is generally believed to be extremely low; seed-per-seedling ratios of 500 to 1,000 seeds or more are commonly reported in harvested areas (36,70). These surfaces vary considerably, however, and their receptivity for germination and seedling establishment depend on the amount of solar radiation at the surface, type of organic substrate, degree of disturbance to the organic layers, weather conditions at the time of germination, amount of seed rain, and other biotic and abiotic factors. In undisturbed stands, seedlings are frequently found on organic matter, particularly rotted wood (32,170,187). Germination and seedling establishment, although not as efficient as on mineral soil in terms of seed-to-seedling ratios, are common on organic substrates after harvest in both clearcuts and shelterwoods (124,178). A key for identifying the seedlings of North American spruce species is available (95). Optimum conditions for seedling growth have been delineated for container production of planting stock in greenhouses. The most suitable temperature conditions are alternating day/night levels as opposed to a constant temperature regime. At 400 lumens/m² (37.2 lumens/ft², or footcandles) light intensity, a 25°/20° C (77°/68° F) day/night regime is recommended for white spruce (13,122,154). Temperature and light intensity effects interact: at low intensities, about 40 lumens/m² (3.7 lumens/ft²), a 28°/13° C (82°/55° F) day/night regime is favorable (11). A short photoperiod (14 hours or less) causes growth cessation, while a photoperiod extended with low light intensities to 16 hours or more brings about continuous (free) growth. Little is gained by using more than 16 hours low light intensity supplement once the seedlings are in the free growth mode. Long photoperiods using high light intensities of from 10,000 to 20,000 lumens/m² (930 to 1,860 lumens/ft²) increase dry matter production. Increasing the light period from 15 to 24 hours may double the dry matter growth (13,122). Seedling growth can be closely controlled by manipulating the environment. Short photoperiods induce dormancy and permit the formation of needle primordia. Primordia formation requires from 8 to 10 weeks and must be followed by 6 weeks of chilling at 2° C (36° F) (100,109,123). Prompt bud breaking occurs if the seedlings then are exposed to 16-hour photoperiods at the 25°/20° C (77°/68° F) temperature regime. Freedom from environmental stress (for example, lack of moisture) is essential for maintaining free growth (99, 100). It must be kept in mind that free growth is a juvenile characteristic. According to Logan (99), it is lost when seedlings are 5 to 10 years old, but our observations suggest that it would be extremely rare in seedlings older than 5 years. At the end of the first growing season, natural regeneration may be from 10 to 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 in) tall. Root length is from 20 to 100 mm (0.8 to 4.0 in), depending on site and seedbed type. The stem is unbranched; the taproot normally develops lateral roots that may be from 30 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) long (34,62,72,89,193). Natural regeneration usually does not exceed from 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 in) in average height after 4 to 6 years. The number of branches increases significantly during this period. Lateral root length may be as much as 100 cm (39 in), but rooting depth may not increase significantly. Shoot dry weight (including foliage) increases from 0.2 to 5 g (3.09 to 77.16 grains) and root dry weight from 0.06 to 1 g (0.92 to 15.43 grains) between ages 2 and 6 (37,70,72,89,165, 168,190). The length of time required to reach breast height under open conditions ranges from 10 to 20 years depending on site; under stand conditions, growth to this height may take 40 or more years (61). Growth is greatest at full light intensity (9,98). Reducing light intensity to 50 percent of full light reduced height growth by 25 percent, shoot weight by 50 percent, and rooting depth by 40 percent in 10-year-old seedlings; at 15 percent of full light, no spruce survived (37). Control of competing herbaceous vegetation has resulted in 38 and 92 percent increases in growth 3 years after planting (150). White spruce is sensitive to transplanting shock. Check-the prolonged period of minimal growth-is considered by some forest managers to be a problem serious enough to disqualify white spruce as a plantation species. The cause of check, though not fully understood, is thought to be nutrient stress resulting from the root's inability to develop in the planting zone. Check is difficult to predict and prevent (141,147), but seedling quality is a factor, and any treatment that will improve early root growth is undoubtedly beneficial (7,9). Vegetative Reproduction- Vegetative reproduction from layering is common at some latitudinal treeline sites in Canada and Alaska (26,39). Layering probably is an important means of maintaining the stand when sexual reproduction is limited or nonexistent because of climatic limitations. In the far north, the density of trees originating from layering may reach 1830/ha (740/acre) and generally is inversely related to site quality. Layering is most common in stands in which trees are open grown and the lower branches touch the ground. The branch roots when it is covered by moss, litter, or soil and organic material. The time required for an individual to become independent of the ortet (parent) is not known, but 30- to 50-year-old ramets are no longer connected with the ortet (26). Air layering on a 6-year-old tree has been successful; early May is the best time for preparing the air layers. Juvenile white spruce can be readily propagated by rooted cuttings (54,55). Rooting ability varies greatly from tree to tree, but it is too low for practical use by the time most trees are 10 to 15 years old. Older trees can be grafted. Results are best in the winter (February, March) in the greenhouse, with forced rootstock in pots and dormant scions, but fall grafting is possible. Late winter-early spring grafting in the field also is possible but should be done before bud swelling becomes pronounced (107).",Reproduction and Early Growth,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- In white spruce, strong apical dominance of the terminal shoot leads to the excurrent growth form. Crown form may deviate substantially from the idealized conical shape because of variation in the growth of lateral branches as a result of tree and branch age, damage, or growing conditions. The most significant deviations occur near the treeline where marginal growing conditions can result in shrub-like trees. During the juvenile phase, trees can be kept growing continuously if all growth factors are within the optimum range. This is called ""free growth."" In older trees shoot growth is determinate; that is, the annual complement of needles is preformed in the overwintering bud. The formation of the following year's buds in British Columbia (lat. 54° to 55° N.) begins in late April or early May with the initiation of the first bud scales. Needles for the next growing season are initiated in August and September after the period of shoot elongation. On productive forest sites, visible signs of shoot growth (flushing) are first observed in early May or early June (108), 6 to 7.5 weeks after the first cell divisions signal the end of dormancy. Up to 6 weeks delay in flushing may result from a 500-m (1,640-ft) increase in elevation (120). Growth of the leader and upper branches occurs over a slightly longer period than growth of lower branches (46). The time of flushing is primarily temperature dependent and therefore varies with the weather. The number of degree days accumulated at the time of flushing may vary from year to year, however, indicating that more than air temperature controls the initiation of the annual shoot-growth cycle (8). Within a stand, there can also be as much as a 3-week difference among individual trees (111,116). The period of shoot elongation is short. In northern Wisconsin, the period from flushing until the terminal leader had completed 95 percent of total elongation ranged from 26 to 41 days among individual trees. This is much shorter than the 6- to 11-week period reported by others (108,149) but agrees closely with data from central British Columbia (120). In interior Alaska (lat. 64° N.), 85 to 90 percent of terminal shoot growth was completed by June 14 and 100 percent by June 28 (70). The cessation of shoot growth is more dependent on photoperiod than on temperature (120). Cambial activity in Alaska (lat. 64° N.) and Massachusetts (lat. 42° N.) has been compared. The period of cambial activity is about half as long and the rate of cell division twice as great in Alaska as in Massachusetts (56). Wood production (mitotic activity) was observed to begin after 11 degree days (6° C (43° F) threshold) in Alaska (early May) and Massachusetts (late April). Eighty percent of the tracheids were produced in 45 and 95 days in Alaska and Massachusetts, respectively. Variation of the same magnitude depending on site and year has been reported within a small region in Ontario (46). Culture affects growth; thinned, fertilized stands begin growing about 2 weeks earlier (late May versus early June) and have greater growth during the grand period. Termination of growth is not influenced by thinning (157). Individual white spruce trees more than 30 m (100 ft) tall and from 60 to 90 cm (24 to 36 in) d.b.h. are found on good sites throughout the range. The tallest trees reported are more than 55 m (180 ft) and from 90 to 120 cm (36 to 48 in) d.b.h. (106,149). Maximum individual tree age appears to occur on stress sites at latitudinal or elevational treeline rather than on good sites where trees attain maximum size. A partially rotted 16.5 cm (6.5 in) tree growing on the Mackenzie River Delta (above lat. 67° N.) had a 589-year ring sequence, and trees nearly 1,000 years old occur above the Arctic Circle (51). On good sites, trees 100 to 250 years old are common, and the oldest trees (250 to 300 years) are frequently found in areas protected from fire, such as islands, and in relatively wet upland situations (83,185). Normal yield tables and harmonized site-index (base 100 years) curves provide estimates of growth and productivity for unmanaged stands in Alaska and western Canada. In Alaska, Farr (41) reported site indices at age 100 years from 15.2 m (50 ft) to 32.3 m (106 ft). Growth, yield, and selected stand characteristics for well-stocked white spruce stands in Alaska are summarized in table 2. The lowest recorded mean annual increment (0.5 m³/ha or 7 ft³/acre) comes from the Mackenzie River Delta-the northernmost area of white spruce in North America. Site indices ranging from 15.2 to 27.4 m (50 to 90 ft) (base 70-year stump age) have been reported for the Mixedwood region of Alberta (82), and in the Mixedwood section of Saskatchewan, growth and yield were reported for poor (site index 17.1 m or 56 ft), average (site index 21.9 m or 72 ft), and good (site index 26.8 m or 88 ft) sites (84). The Saskatchewan data are summarized in table 3. Mean annual increments of 6.3 to 7.0 m³/ha (90 to 100 ft³/acre) have been attained on the best loam soils, and the highest site index 36.6 m (120 ft) is for British Columbia white spruce (61). Site indices for the Lake States (14) are somewhat higher than the best in Saskatchewan (84), but below the best sites in British Columbia. Biomass production in white spruce is not well documented. In the Yukon Flats Region, AK, a 165-year-old stand with a density of about 975 trees per hectare (394/acre), 63 percent less than 20 cm (8 in) in d.b.h., had a standing crop of 12.61 kg/m² (2.58 lb/ft²). It was 97 percent spruce and 3 percent alder and willow. A 124-year-old stand (maximum tree age) with a density of about 3,460 trees per hectare (1,400/acre), 97 percent less than 10 cm (4 in) in d.b.h., had a standing crop of 4.68 k g/m² (0.96 lb/ft²). It was 91 percent spruce and 9 percent alder and willow. Of a total biomass of 57.13 k g/m² (11.70 lb/ft²), 44 percent was overstory, 34 percent forest floor, and 22 percent roots in a 165-year-old interior Alaska stand (194). Within-tree biomass distribution in two approximately 40-year-old trees (total biomass 25 kg or 55 lb) was foliage, 31 percent; branches, 31 percent; and stem, 38 percent. Proportionally, stem biomass was much higher (59 percent) in a 95-year-old tree with a total weight of 454 kg (1,000 lb) above ground; 21 percent was foliage and 18 percent branches (80). Total biomass in an unthinned white spruce plantation in Ontario has been measured at 13.89 kg/m² (2.84 lb/ft²); 19 percent was in roots, 9 percent foliage, and the remaining 72 percent was in the branches and main stem (142). Natural stands of white spruce can respond well to cultural practices. Released 71-year-old trees in Maine had a mean annual increase (10-year period) in circumference of 1 cm (0.4 in) compared to 0.6 cm (0.2 in) for control trees (45). Basal area increment in 70-year-old Alaskan spruce for a 5-year period was increased 330 percent by thinning and fertilization, 220 percent by thinning, and 160 percent by fertilization (157). Even old white spruce can respond to release. The ability to respond is related to type of release and degree of damage sustained during release (66). In Manitoba, diameter increment of spruce of all size classes (ages 10 to 60 years) was doubled by removing competing aspen (138). Spruce having their crowns in contact or immediately below those of aspen can be expected to double their height growth following release. The combined effect of increased diameter increment and height growth can increase spruce volume production by 60 percent. In unmanaged plantations, the onset of density-dependent mortality is determined by site quality and initial spacing. Yield tables for unmanaged white spruce plantations in Ontario (143) indicate that mortality at age 20 years will have occurred at 6,730 trees per hectare (2,722 trees/acre) at site index 15.2 m (50 ft) (base age 50 years). At site index 24.4 m (80 ft), mortality will have occurred at densities of 2,990 trees per hectare (1,210/acre) or more by age 20. At 1,080 trees per hectare (436/acre), predicted mortality begins between 30 and 35 years for site index 24.4 m (80 ft) and 40 and 45 years for site index 21.3 m (70 ft). Total volume production in unthinned plantations in Ontario (table 4) is higher than the production in natural stands in Saskatchewan. White spruce stands should be maintained at basal areas from 23.0 to 32.1 m²/ha (100 to 140 ft²/acre) to provide maximum volume growth and good individual tree development; below these levels, individual tree increment and resistance to some pests are greatly increased, but total volume production is reduced. For the sites studied, maximum mean annual increment occurred at about age 55 in unmanaged plantations; at this age, 10 percent of total volume is lost from competition (5,9,140,142). Rooting Habit- White spruce is frequently characterized as shallow rooted. This generalization stems, however, from the species' ability to occupy sites where soil conditions limit rooting depth (148); depending on soil conditions, competition, and genetics, different forms of taproots and layered roots do develop (145,166). The adventitious multilayered root systems that develop on floodplains in response to silt deposits are particularly noteworthy. Trees from 2 to 132 years old can grow new roots in this way; the response is probably important for maintaining tree vigor (77,164). Depth of rooting in white spruce is commonly between 90 and 120 cm (36 and 48 in), but taproots and sinker roots can descend to a depth of 3 m (10 ft). Eighty-five percent of the root mass was in the top 0.3 m (1 ft) on sites in Ontario, but on the most northern sites, large roots are heavily concentrated within 15 cm (6 in) of the organic-mineral soil interface. Lateral spread of the root system was reported to be as much as 18.5 m (61 ft) on sandy soils in Ontario, and lateral root extension was estimated at 0.3 m (1 ft) per year (141,145,148). Fine-root production in a Maine plantation was 6990 kg/ha (6,237 lb/acre); 87 percent of this material was located in the top 15 cm (6 in) of soil (136). In an Ontario plantation, fine roots 0.25 cm (0.10 in) in diameter and smaller comprised about 10 percent (2670 kg/ha or 2,382 lb/acre) of the total root biomass (143). Sixty-seven percent of the fine-root production in a mixed spruce-fir stand in British Columbia was in the forest floor and A horizon; the average depth of these horizons was 8.3 cm (3.3 in) (86). Mycorrhizae are an important component of the fine roots (143) of most conifer species (89), but only a few of the fungi that form mycorrhizae have been found on white spruce. Root grafting appears to be fairly common in white spruce. In one study, about 27 percent of the trees had root grafts with other trees (140,149). Reaction to Competition- White spruce is intermediate in tolerance to shade. It is equally or less tolerant to shade than black or red spruce, hemlock (Tsuga spp.), balsam and alpine fir, sugar maple, and beech (Fagus spp.). It is more tolerant than aspen, paper birch, and lodgepole pine. Large numbers of white spruce may become established immediately following disturbance and form even-aged stands. Because seedling and juvenile growth of white spruce is slower than its early successional associates, it remains in the understory for 50 to 70 years (25,104,160,169). Although white spruce survives this period of suppression, growth will be significantly reduced (139). White spruce shows a significant response to release resulting from natural causes or silvicultural treatment; ages of trees exhibiting good growth after release range from very young to 200 or more years (6,22,45, 139,185). White spruce also forms multi-aged pure stands or is a component of multi-aged, late-succession stands mixed with the true firs, maple, beech, and other species. In such stands, age ranges from 200 to 250 years in Alberta (25) and from 300 to 350 years in British Columbia (104) and at treeline in northern Alaska (26). Natural stands occurring within relatively small areas can show markedly different age structures depending on age of the site, stand history, soil conditions, and other variables (83). The distribution of ages is not continuous but consists of several groups of ages separated by periods when no white spruce become established. Damaging Agents- Throughout the range of white spruce, fire has been an important, sometimes dominant factor in forest dynamics (25,136,162). Mature forests are easily destroyed because of their high susceptibility to fire. Under certain circumstances, in unmanaged forests white spruce may be eliminated; the probability increases with latitude because seed years are infrequent and seed quality poor in some years in the north (136,183). During early- and mid-succession, white spruce is more susceptible to fire than aspen, birch, black spruce, and lodgepole pine (182). Fire frequency, intensity, and severity, and not simply the presence of fire, determine white spruce distribution and growth. Fire frequency may range from 10 years or less to more than 200 years; most commonly, it is from 60 to 200 years. If fires occur at short intervals (less than 40 or 50 years), the source of white spruce seed can be eliminated. The reduction in depth of organic matter depends generally on fire severity and is a critical factor because the organic substrate that remains following fire makes a poor seedbed. In general, even severe fires do not expose mineral soil on more than 40 or 50 percent of a burn, and this area is usually distributed in small patches. On floodplains in the northwestern part of the range, floods and silt deposits provide a seedbed for germination and seedling establishment. Flooding is detrimental to young seedlings, however, and establishment of spruce stands may be prevented until the flooding frequency declines. Fifty years may be required after initial sandbar formation before sedimentation rate declines enough for white spruce to colonize (104). As much as 20 percent of the seedlings may be killed on moist and wet sites that have been scarified by tractor and bulldozer blade (94). Slow initial root growth makes young seedlings and transplants particularly susceptible to frost heaving. The severity of damage generally is greatest on fine-textured and wet soils where water is adequate for ice crystal formation in the surface soil. Late fall and winter seeding and spring field planting are best in most cases (141). White spruce roots respond vigorously to pruning (146); spring planting with root pruning is likely to be of some protective value against frost heaving. Depending on soil texture and drainage, white spruce may be prone to windthrow. Windthrow is common along stand edges and in heavily thinned stands on shallow or poorly drained soils where root systems are surficial. On soils where a strong taproot, strong descending secondary roots, or multi-layered root systems develop, the species is much more windfirm. In mixed stands in which white spruce is overtopped by hardwoods, the leader and upper stem of spruce are frequently damaged by hardwood branches whipping in the wind. Snow and ice can break up to 70 percent of white spruce in stands and hail can cause defoliation, stem lesions, and leader or terminal bud mortality (31,52,156). White spruce vegetative and reproductive growth are particularly susceptible to frost damage at the time of flushing (116,181). The risk of frost damage is less for late flushing genotypes (110,116). Damage by fall frost is uncommon but has been observed in 1-year-old seedlings, when plantations heavily damaged by spring frost have responded with regrowth in August. Damage from spring frost is less serious after trees reach from 4 to 6 m (13 to 19 ft) in height. Because the species is so susceptible to frost damage, sites exposed to late spring frost should be avoided in all white spruce regeneration efforts. Young seedlings are damaged by rodents. The snowshoe hare can be a significant pest, but white spruce is not a preferred animal food (4,12). Environmental factors such as frost, mammals, birds, insects, and disease reduce the number of cones and the number of dispersed seeds (101,181). The impact of squirrels can be substantial. In Alaska, they may harvest as much as 90 percent of the cone crop (144,193). Small mammals such as deer mice, red-backed and meadow voles, chipmunks, and shrews can be an important cause of failure of natural regeneration and artificial regeneration by direct seeding. Seed consumption by individual animals can be very high-2,000 white spruce seeds per day for caged animals of the species mentioned- and the population density substantial but highly variable. Estimates range from 7 animals per hectare (3/acre) to as high as 44/ha (18/acre). Even at the low density, the impact on regeneration would be unacceptably high (126,141). The impact on seed varies with the time of seeding: 50 percent for spring-sown seeds as compared to 19 percent or less for winter-sown seeds. Coating seeds with repellent is effective and has little influence on seed germination even when coated seeds have been stored for 5.5 years (125,127). The impact of birds feeding on seeds is small compared to that of rodents (126), but chickadees, grosbeaks, crossbills, juncos, and sparrows feed on coniferous seeds. Seed losses from insects can be a serious problem. The spruce cone maggot (Hylemya (Lasiomma) anthracina), the fir coneworm (Dioryctria abietivorella), and the spruce seed moth (Laspeyresia youngana) are most important. Hylemya leaves the cone in midsummer and, as a result, Laspeyresia is blamed for the damage it does; however, where the infestation is severe, Hylemya may destroy 100 percent of the seed (59). Damage by D. abietivorella is particularly severe in years of heavy cone crops and appears to be found when cones develop in clusters. The following insects also attack seeds and cones but do less damage: the spruce cone axis midge (Dasineura rachiphaga), the spruce seed midge (Mayetiola carpophaga), the seed chalcids (Megastigmus atedius and M. picea), the cone cochylid (Henricus fuscodorsana), and the cone moth (Barbara mappana) (59). The only disease associated with cone production is the cone rust Chrysomyxa pirolata (151). Seeds produced from infected cones are about half the weight but the same size as healthy seeds. Seeds are fragile because seed coats are poorly developed, and seed mortality is almost 100 percent in severely affected cones (101,151). Even if viable seeds are produced, they are not readily dispersed because cone malformation and resinosis prevent efficient opening of the cone scales (151). White spruce seedlings are affected by disease during the dormant and growing seasons. Snow blight (Phacidium infestans) causes damage in nurseries and the field. Various species of Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Phytophthora, and Fusarium have been shown to be moderately to highly pathogenic to spruce seedlings in both pre- and post-emergent conditions (65). Pythium and Fusarium as well as Epicoccum and Phoma can also injure seedlings in cold storage; many of these damaged seedlings die when they are field planted (67). Nematodes have been shown to cause winterkill and reduce seedling vigor. Needle and bud rusts are common throughout the range of white spruce. The most important rust causing premature defoliation in Canada is Chrysomyxa ledicola. Losses of up to 90 percent of the current year's needles have been observed in Western Canada. Other needle rusts that infect white spruce are C. weiri, C. empetri, C. ledi, and C. chiogenis. The witches' broom rust (C. arctostaphyli) frequently causes dead branches, abnormally proliferating branches, deformed boles, and reduced growth. A bud rust (C. woroninii) is more prevalent in far northern areas and infects seedlings and vegetative and female buds of mature trees (65,101,195). Stem diseases of white spruce are not of major importance. A canker caused by Valsa kunzei has been reported. One of the most conspicuous and common stem and branch deformities is a tumor-like growth of unknown origin. These tumors occur throughout the range and may reach 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) in diameter. In a small test of grafts of tumored and tumor-free trees, tumor growth was transmitted to some, but not all, ramets in some clones of tumored trees (44). Root diseases of white spruce affect both seedlings and mature trees. Inonotus tomentosus is a major cause of slow decline and death of white spruce in patches of 0.4 ha (1 acre) or more in Saskatchewan. The disease has been called the ""stand-opening disease."" It develops slowly over a period of 20 to 30 years but the impact can be substantial- 87 percent of white spruce in mixed stands either dead or heavily rotted at the butt. Stand openings occur on soils of all textures but rarely on alkaline soils (174). Trees planted in infected areas are also damaged (175). Other root-rot fungi associated with white spruce are Coniophora puteana, Scytinostroma galactinium, Pholiota alnicola, Polyporus guttulatus, P. sulphureus, and Phaeolus schweinitzii. Trunk rots affecting white spruce include Haematostereum sanguinolentum, Peniophora septentrionalis, and Phellinus pini. These species produce rot development beyond the tree base. Coniophora puteana, Fomitopsis pinicola, and Scytinostroma galactinium are associated only with butt rot. In general, cull percentage in white spruce caused by rot is low, particularly for trees less than 100 to 120 years old. Most trees older than 200 years have significant amounts of rot, however. Although most spruce species are seriously injured by the European strain of scleroderris canker (Gremmeniella abietina), white spruce suffers only from tip dieback and eventually recovers (137). Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) is usually associated with black spruce, but it has killed white spruce in Minnesota (3), along the coast of Maine, and in the Maritime Provinces. White spruce is attacked by a number of bark beetles in the genera Dendroctonus, Ips, Trypodendron, Dryocoetes, Scolytus, Polygraphus, and others. Although most of these species attack trees of low vigor, dying trees, windthrows, and slash, the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) attacks trees of normal vigor and has killed large areas of white and other spruces. In areas with transition maritime climates, such as western and south-central Alaska, prolonged extreme cold (-40° C or -40° F) kills large numbers of beetles. Where spruce beetle outbreaks are common, resistance of trees is greater in mature stands with stocking levels of 18m²/ha (80 ft²/acre) or less because of wide tree spacing and rapid growth (58). Dense stocking contributes to cold soils in the spring and thus tree moisture stress, which predisposes the trees to beetle attack (57). Bark beetles bore or mine in the phloem. or inner bark and girdle the tree. Symptoms of beetle attack are pitch flow tubes and fine wood particles on the bark or at the base of the tree. The foliage of the attacked tree changes color and dies, but this may not occur until after the beetle has left the tree. The best method of preventing beetle outbreaks is to remove or destroy desirable habitat such as slash and damaged trees; trees weakened by budworms are particularly susceptible. Wood-boring insects (Monochamus spp., Tetropium spp., and Melanophila spp.) attack weakened or dead white spruce and are particularly attracted to burned areas. They can attack trees almost before the fire cools. The intensity of attack is determined by the condition of the individual tree (173). Lumber recovery from heavily infested trees declines rapidly because of extensive tunneling. The spruce budworm. (Choristoneura fumiferana) and the western spruce budworm (C. occidentalis) feed and mine in old foliage, in developing reproductive and vegetative buds, and in new foliage of the expanding shoot. True firs are the principal hosts, but spruces are readily attacked and injured. Budworms are the most destructive conifer defoliators; severe defoliation for 2 years reduces growth, and sustained outbreaks have killed all spruce in some stands (48,81). Plantations are not usually subject to serious damage until they are about 6 m (20 ft) tall (141). The yellowheaded spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis), another defoliator, is not important in closed stands but can seriously reduce growth or kill plantation-grown trees if defoliation continues for 2 or more years (141). A number of other sawflies including the European spruce sawfly (Diprion hercyniae), also damage the species. Spruce spider mites (Oligonychus spp.) build up in damaging numbers in early spring and summer and sometimes in fall. They are also common on young white spruce plants growing in greenhouses. Their feeding destroys the chlorophyll-bearing cells of the needle surface, causing a bleached look. Continuous attacks weaken and eventually kill the tree (81). The European spruce needleminer (Epinotia nanana) causes unsightly webbing and kills needles on spruces in the Eastern United States. Heavy attacks cause severe defoliation, and weakened trees succumb to secondary pests. Other needleminers of less importance are in the genera Taniva and Pulicalvaria (122). Other insects damaging spruce needles include needle worms, loopers, tussock moths, the spruce harlequin, and the spruce bud scale. The gall-forming adelgids (Adelges spp.), of which the eastern spruce gall adelgid (A. abietus) is the most prevalent, cause cone-shaped galls on the shoots. Other gall-forming insects belong to the Pineus and Mayetiola genera (122). Although not important for forest trees, these galls can deform and stunt the growth of seedlings, saplings, and ornamental trees (48,81). Spruce buds are damaged by bud moths, Zeiraphera spp., the bud midge (Rhabdophaga swainei), and bud and twig miners (Argyresthia spp.). None of these insects causes serious damage (122), but killing of the terminal leader by Rhabdophaga results in multiple leaders and thus poor tree form. White spruce is considered lightly susceptible to damage by the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi) and certainly is much less damaged than either black or Norway spruce (Picea abies). However, an ecotype of the insect, sometimes called the Engelmann spruce weevil, is an important pest in plantations in interior British Columbia and on natural regeneration in British Columbia and Alberta (141). Warren's collar weevil (Hylobius warreni) does cause appreciable damage on spruce. Small trees may be girdled and killed; on older trees, the wounds are entries for root rots such as Inonotus tomentosus (122). In controlled experiments, 4-year-old white spruce has shown high radio-sensitivity when exposed to chronic gamma irradiation. The trees were most sensitive in mid-July when the central mother-cell zone was enlarging.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,14,1
"White spruce grows on a wide variety of soils of glacial, lacustrine, marine, or alluvial origin. Substrata represent the geological eras from Precambrian to Cenozoic and a great variety of rock formations, including granites, gneisses, sedimentaries, slates, schists, shales, and conglomerates (134,158). Some bedrocks are acidic, such as granites, and others are basic dolomites and limestones. Mature northern white spruce stands have well-developed moss layers that significantly affect the mineral soil. The layer is most highly developed in regions with adequate moisture conditions and is dominated by feather mosses (e.g., Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, Ptilium cristacastrensis, and Dicranum spp.) rather than Sphagnum species (92,159). In the far north, total depth of the live moss-organic mat frequently is from 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 in) or more. Development is, in part, regulated by flooding and stand composition. Stands in which hardwoods are mixed with white spruce tend to have shallower, discontinuous moss layers. The layer is a strong competitor for nutrients and an effective insulator that reduces temperature in the rooting zone. The temperature reduction varies with latitude and climatic regime. In Alaska, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories, soil temperatures can reach the point at which permafrost is developed and maintained (53,158,161). Podzolic soils predominate over the range of the species, but white spruce also grows on brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic soils. On sandy podzols, it is usually a minor species, although white spruce is common on sand flats and other coarse-textured soils in the Georgian Bay area. It grows on shallow mesic organic soils in Saskatchewan, and in central Yukon on organic soils with black spruce (85,134,149). White spruce is able to grow on extremely diverse sites but to achieve the best development it is generally more demanding than associated conifers. The range of sites supporting the species becomes more limited northward with increasing climate severity (149). In the Algoma District of Ontario, the species is a major component of the stands on calcareous podzol loams and clays and shows exceptionally good development on melanized loams and clays. In Saskatchewan, it does best on moderately well-drained clay loams (84); in Alberta Mixedwoods, the best development is on well-drained lacustrine soils (60). Further north in Canada and Alaska, particularly productive stands are found on moist alluvial soils along rivers (78,79,90,162) and on south-facing upland sites (41,158). White spruce grows on both acid and alkaline soils and acidity (pH) values from 4.7 to 7.0 and perhaps higher are probably optimum (10,141,149,176). On the floodplains of the northern rivers, pH may vary from 5.0 to 8.2 (194). In the Northwest Territories, the species grows in the alpine fir forest on strongly acid soils with a surface pH of from 4.0 to 4.5, increasing with depth to pH 5.5 at 15 cm (6 in); but at somewhat lower elevations, the mixed coniferous forest soils have a pH of 4.0 at the surface with pH 8.0 at 38 cm (15 in) depth. Good growth of white spruce on alkaline soils has also been reported in Mixedwoods in the Prairie Provinces (141). In New York, one factor common to most white spruce locations is an abundant calcium supply. Of the wide range of sites and soils on which white spruce grows, soils in the orders Alfisols and Inceptisols are most common. The species also tolerates a range of fertility levels. On the alluvial soils along northern rivers, nitrogen may vary from 0.2 to 0.01 percent and phosphorus from 10 to 2 p/m. On adjacent upland soils derived from loess parent material, nitrogen may vary from 0.1 to 0.4 percent and phosphorus from 10 to 3 p/m (194). Good growth requires a dependable supply of well-aerated water, yet the species will tolerate a wide range of moisture conditions. It will not tolerate stagnant water that reduces the rooting volume. On the other hand, white spruce will grow on dry sites if they are fertile. Soil fertility, soil moisture, and physical properties are interrelated. Moisture alone will not improve yields unless it is associated with increased fertility (149). Nor will increased moisture be beneficial if soil structure is less than optimum. In Riding Mountain, Manitoba, for example, lower yields on the moist sites have been attributed to the higher clay content and massive structure when wet and columnar structure in dry conditions (73). Other soil factors that must be carefully considered include the depth to ground water, permeability (especially of surface layers), presence of hardpans or claypans, and the mineralogical composition of the parent material. Minimum soil-fertility standards for white spruce are higher than for other conifers commonly planted in the Lake States (176) (table 1). Fertility requirements for white spruce based on foliar analyses are in percent of dry matter: nitrogen 1.50 to 2.50; phosphorus 0.18 to 0.32; potassium 0.45 to 0.80; magnesium 0.10 to 0.20; and calcium 0.15 to 0.40. At the lower end of the range, plants will respond to fertilizer. These data are from sand-culture experiments and are definitely provisional (152); however, except for calcium, they are in line with values published for 3-year-old seedlings in the nursery (71). Little specific information is available on the effects of fertilizer in natural stands or plantations of white spruce, but growth gains have been reported after treatments to overcome nutrient deficiencies (141). Response of established older stands and new plantations to fertilization can occur within a year of treatment (9,156). Observations in progeny test plots in northern Wisconsin suggest that a hand application of 10-10-10 fertilizer may shorten the period of planting shock. In a nursery in which prolonged use may have depleted exchangeable bases and probably micronutrients, an application of micronutrient and major nutrient fertilizers resulted in a greatly increased volume of root systems and their absorbing capacity, and in a decreased top-root ratio. But indiscriminate use of micronutrient fertilizers together with nitrogen fertilizers may reduce seedling quality, making plants succulent, with a high top-root ratio (71). White spruce stand development can significantly affect forest floor composition and biomass and mineral soil physical and chemical properties. The magnitude of these effects will vary with site conditions and disturbance history of the site. On sites in Alaska, organic layers accumulate to greater depths in mature spruce stands than in hardwood stands growing on similar sites. As a result, soil temperatures decrease and, in extreme cases, permafrost develops (161,163). Acidity of the mineral soil in spruce plantations established on abandoned farmland in Ontario decreased by 1.2 pH units over a 46-year period (10). Soil conditions under 40-year-old white spruce differed significantly in some respects from that under aspen, red pine, and jack pine growing on the same soil type; relative differences among species varied with specific nutrients (2).",Soils and Topography,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,15,1
"White spruce trees yield many useful products (105,148). The manufacture of wood fiber and lumber products is well known and white spruce continues to be one of the most important commercial species in the boreal forest. Less well-known uses of white spruce wood are for house logs, musical instruments, paddles, and various boxes and containers. Historically, white spruce provided shelter and fuel for both Indians and white settlers of the northern forest. White spruce was the most important species utilized by natives of interior Alaska (105). The wood was used for fuel, but other parts of the tree also had a purpose; bark was used to cover summer dwellings, roots for lashing birchbark baskets and canoes, and boughs for bedding. Spruce pitch (resin) and extracts from boiled needles were used for medicinal purposes (163). White spruce stands are a source of cover and food for some species of game. Moose and hares frequent these forests but seldom eat white spruce, whereas red squirrels and spruce grouse live in these forests and also consume parts of the tree. Prey species (furbearers) such as marten, wolverine, lynx, wolves, and others utilize these forests. White spruce forests have significant value in maintaining soil stability and watershed values and for recreation. White spruce can be planted as an ornamental and is used in shelterbelts.",Special Uses,White Spruce,picea,glauca,conifer,16,1
"Whitebark pine is most frequently found growing with other high mountain conifers, although pure whitebark pine stands are common in dry mountain ranges. The forest cover type Whitebark Pine (Society of American Foresters Type 208) (70) is used to designate pure stands or mixed stands in which the species comprises a plurality. Whitebark pine is also a minor component of Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (Type 206) in the Rockies, eastern Cascades, and the Blue Mountains; Mountain Hemlock (Type 205) in much of the Cascades and British Columbia coastal mountains; and California Mixed Subalpine (Type 256) in the California Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and Klamath Mountains. In these open, upper subalpine forests, whitebark pine is associated with mountain hemlock, California and Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica vars. magnifica and shastensis), Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana), western white pine (P. monticola), and locally, foxtail (P. balfouriana) and limber (P. flexilis) pines. In the dry ranges of the Rockies south of latitude 47° N. and in south-central Oregon, whitebark pine is found within the highest elevations of the cover type Lodgepole Pine (Type 218). In the Rockies, whitebark pine adjoins Interior Douglas-Fir (Type 210) and Limber Pine (Type 219). In the East Humboldt, Ruby, Jarbidge, and Bull Run Ranges of northeastern Nevada, whitebark's principal associate is limber pine (23). In the timberline zone, conditions for tree development are so severe that any species that can become well established is considered a part of the climax community. In Montana and northern Idaho, the whitebark pine stands in the timberline zone (above forest line or where subalpine fir becomes stunted) make up the Pinus albicaulis-Abies lasiocarpa habitat types (24,66). Whitebark pine is also a climax species in other habitat types, mostly on dry sites, in Montana, central Idaho, and western Wyoming (71,72,83). Pinus albicaulis/Vaccinium scoparium is probably the most widespread and abundant habitat type that includes pure whitebark pine stands in the Rocky Mountains. Various aspects of the ecology of this habitat type in Montana and Wyoming have been described (26,27,83). In the subalpine forest of the Northern Rockies whitebark pine is a principal long-lived seral component of the Abies lasiocarpa/Luzula hitchcockii and Abies lasiocarpa-Pinus albicaulis/Vaccinium scoparium habitat types (66). Prior to the early 1900's, whitebark pine was apparently more abundant in the subalpine forest as a result of natural fires, which favored its survival and regeneration over competing fir and spruce (6,46,63). In the southern Canadian Rockies and the inland mountains of southern British Columbia, whitebark pine is also primarily a seral associate in the highest elevations of the subalpine fir-spruce forest (1,9,65). Principal undergrowth species in Rocky Mountain and northern Cascade stands include grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium scoparium), mountain arnica (Arnica latifolia), red mountain heath (Phyllodoce empetriformis), rustyleaf menziesia (Menziesia ferruginea), smooth woodrush (Luzula hitchcockii), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), elk sedge (Carex geyeri), Parry rush (Juncus parryi), Ross sedge (Carex rossii), and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis). In south-central Oregon the primary undergrowth species are long-stolon sedge (Carex pensylvanica) and Wheeler bluegrass (Poa nervosa) (41). Undergrowth is sparse in Sierra Nevada stands.",Associated Forest Cover,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,1,1
"Whitebark pine grows in a cold, windy, snowy, and generally moist climatic zone. In moist mountain ranges, whitebark pine is most abundant on warm, dry exposures. Conversely, in semiarid ranges, it becomes prevalent on cool exposures and moist sites. Weather data from several whitebark pine sites in the Inland Northwest suggest the climatic interpretations that follow (3,83). Summers are short and cool with mean July temperatures ranging from 13° to 15° C (55° to 59° F) in the whitebark pine forest and from 10° to 12° C (50° to 54° F) in the adjacent timberline zone. A cool growing season, as defined by mean temperatures higher than 5.5° C (42° F) (11), lasts about 90 to 110 days in the whitebark pine forest, but light frosts and snowfalls sometimes occur even in mid-summer. The hottest summer days reach temperatures of 26° to 30° C (79° to 86° F). January mean temperatures range from about -9° C (15° F) in Montana to about -5° C (23° F) in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Long-term record low temperatures in Montana and Wyoming stands are probably -40° to -50° C (-40° to -58° F). Mean annual precipitation for most stands where whitebark pine is a major component probably is between 600 and 1800 mm (24 and 72 in). The lower part of this precipitation range applies to mountain ranges in semiarid regions where whitebark pine forms nearly pure stands or is accompanied only by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). The highest precipitation occurs in inland-maritime ranges and near the Cascade crest where whitebark pine grows primarily with subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana). About two-thirds of the precipitation in most stands is snow and sleet, with rain prevailing only from June through September (3). Summer rainfall is often scant in the southern part of whitebark pine's distribution south of about 47° N. latitude. Thus, there is often a droughty period with scant rainfall or remaining snowmelt water for several weeks during mid- to late-summer. Snowpack usually begins to accumulate in late October. By April, the snowpack reaches maximum depth, ranging from about 60 to 125 cm (24 to 50 in) in stands east of the Continental Divide and in other semiarid areas, to 250 to 300 cm (100 to 120 in) in the relatively moist whitebark pine-subalpine fir stands of the Cascades and inland-maritime mountains. Most stands probably have mean annual snowfalls between 460 and 1270 cm (180 and 500 in). Whitebark pine also grows in stunted or krummholz (shrub-like) form on windswept ridgetops where little snow accumulates. Strong winds, thunder storms, and severe blizzards are common to whitebark pine habitats. Wind gusts of hurricane velocity in the tree crowns (more than 117 km/h or 73 mi/h) occur each year on most sites, but most frequently on ridgetops.",Climate,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,2,1
"Most of the wide phenotypic growth form variation in whitebark pine is apparently the result of differences in site and climate. Krummholz whitebark pines have apparently arisen from nutcracker caches of seeds from erect trees (77), implying that the prostrate form is environmentally induced. Conversely, Clausen (20) hypothesized that the alpine (krummholz) and subalpine (tree) forms have a genetic basis. Determination of this will have to await genetic tests. Enzyme studies suggest that high-elevation forms of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir do have a genetic basis (32), but another study showed that a prostrate form of the European stone pine (Pinus cembra), closely related to whitebark, can spontaneously produce an erect tree stem (40). Resistance to white pine blister rust is the most notable phenotypic variation observed in whitebark pine. The species was extremely susceptible to blister rust both in the field and nursery in artificial inoculation tests and has been rated by many people as the most susceptible of all the world's white pines (15). In stands where mortality has been as high as 90 percent, however, many individuals have survived and some are free of rust symptoms. Genetic testing, using artificial inoculation methods to expose seedlings from uninfected wild parents, has demonstrated resistance to be genetic (38). Four main defense mechanisms were observed: absence of infections of needles or stem, shedding of infected needles before the fungus could reach the stem, a chemical interaction between the fungus and short-shoot tissue that killed the fungus, and chemical reactions in the stem that killed host cells, with subsequent walling off of the fungus. A small trial plantation of first-generation wind-pollinated seedlings from resistant whitebark pine parents was established at Marks Butte near Clarkia, Idaho, in 1979 (37). A survey in 1989 revealed 10 surviving seedlings of 200 planted. The survivors were about 1 foot tall. Much of the mortality was due to vegetative competition, especially by beargrass. Survival of planted resistant seedlings would provide a first step toward returning whitebark pine as an important component of the subalpine plant communities, where the adverse impact of birds and rodents on the rust-induced mortality is high and where remaining seed supply is great. Many attempts have been made to cross whitebark pine with the other four white pine species in its subsection Cembrae and with most species in subsection Strobi. Almost all have ended in failure or inconclusive results (16). Only the cross with limber pine, from subsection Strobi, offers slight hope (22). No putative hybrids of whitebark pine have been identified in natural stands.",Genetics,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,7,1
"Whitebark pine grows in the highest elevation forest and at timberline. Its distribution is essentially split into two broad sections, one following the British Columbia Coast Ranges, the Cascade Range, and the Sierra Nevada, and the other covering the Rocky Mountains from Wyoming to Alberta. Whitebark pine is abundant and vigorous on the dry, inland slope of the Coast and Cascade Ranges. It is absent from some of the wettest areas, such as the mountains of Vancouver Island. In the Olympic Mountains, it is confined to peaks in the northeastern rain shadow zone. Whitebark pine also occurs atop the highest peaks of the Klamath Mountains of northwestern California. The Rocky Mountain distribution extends along the high ranges in eastern British Columbia and western Alberta, and southward at high elevations to the Wind River and Salt River Ranges in west-central Wyoming. A small outlying population of whitebark pine is found atop the Sweetgrass Hills in north-central Montana 145 km (90 mi) east of the nearest stands in the Rocky Mountains across the Great Plains grassland (73). The coastal and Rocky Mountain distributions lie only 100 km (62 mi) apart at their closest proximity (10). Even this narrow gap is not absolute; small groves are found on a few isolated peaks in between in northeastern Washington. In addition to the main distribution, whitebark pine grows in the Blue and Wallowa Mountains of northeastern Oregon and in several isolated ranges rising out of the sagebrush steppe in northeastern California, south-central Oregon, and northern Nevada. - The native range of whitebark pine.",Native Range,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,11,1
"Flowering and fruiting- Whitebark pine is monoecious. The female strobili and cones develop near the tip of upper crown branches while the male or pollen strobili develop throughout the crown on the current year's growth (10,60). Whitebark pine flowers are receptive and pollen is shed during the first half of July, but at some mid-elevation sites the species probably flowers in June. The ripe pollen strobili are a distinct carmine, which distinguishes them from the yellow pollen strobili of limber pine. The importance of various factors limiting pollination and fertilization is unknown. The isolation of some individual trees and small populations planted by birds, such as Clark's nutcracker, may prevent pollination. Also, animal planting of genetically similar seeds in a given area might increase the level of inbreeding, which might reduce regeneration success. The female or seed cones ripen by early September of the second year (81). Although there are no good exterior signs of cone and seed ripeness, the cone scales open slightly-but not enough to release the seeds-and can be pulled apart after September 1. Seed Production and Dissemination- Large seed crops are produced at irregular intervals, with smaller crops and crop failures in between. Cone crops may be produced more frequently in the southern parts of whitebark pine's distribution (10). In a Sierra Nevada study area, whitebark pine cone crops were moderate to heavy in each of four years, 1973 to 1976 (74). A study of 29 whitebark pine stands in the northern Rockies found that cone production averaged about 14,000 per hectare (6,000 per acre) over an 8-year period (84). Seeds number from 4,850 to 9,900/kg (2,200 to 4,500/lb) (60,81). The large, heavy, wingless seeds are borne in dense, fleshy, egg-shaped cones usually 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) long. The cone is dark purple, turning brown as it cures in late summer. It is unusual among cones of North American pines in remaining essentially closed (indehiscent) after ripening rather than spreading its scales to release seeds (75). Most of the cones are harvested by animals. Some fall to the ground where they disintegrate rapidly by decay and depredations by mammals and birds. A small percentage remain on the tree into winter. A few cones, complete with weathered scales but without seeds, remain on the branches for several years after ripening. Clark's nutcrackers and red squirrels attack most of the ripening cone crop in the tree tops during August and September. As a result, it is common to find no evidence of cones in a whitebark pine stand except when a careful search is made for cone scales on the ground (10). Clark's nutcrackers have an essential role in planting whitebark pine seeds (42,49,51,74,76,77). Nutcrackers can carry as many as 150 whitebark pine seeds in their sublingual (throat) pouch and they cache groups of one to several seeds in the soil at a depth of 2 to 3 cm (1 in), suitable for germination. Nutcrackers cached an estimated 33,600 limber pine seeds per hectare (13,600/acre) in one open, burned area during one summer; a similar pattern of seed caching would be expected for whitebark pine. Whitebark pine seeds sustain these birds and their young much of the year, but a large proportion of the seed caches go unrecovered. The effects of whitebark pine seed planting by Clark's nutcrackers are readily observable. Despite its heavy wingless seed, this species often regenerates promptly on burned or clearcut areas where a seed source is absent (46,59,76,77,78). Moreover, whitebark pine seedlings in open areas frequently arise together in tight clumps of two to five. The species has become established atop a young geologic formation-Wizard Island in Crater Lake, Oregon, (43)- where seed dispersal by birds would have been necessary. Lone whitebark pine trees grow along alpine ridges, often several miles from the nearest possible seed source (7). Numerous clumped whitebark pine seedlings and saplings can be found far from a seed source in lower elevation forests (for example with ponderosa pine), where whitebark pine does not develop beyond sapling stage. Clark's nutcrackers migrate down to these stands in autumn, bringing whitebark pine seeds with them (7,74). Various mammals also transport and cache whitebark pine seeds (42,74). Red squirrels harvest large quantities of whitebark pine cones and store them in rotten logs and on the ground. Black and grizzly bears raid many of these cone caches, scattering many seeds. Chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and deer mice eat loose seeds and also cache seeds that may ultimately germinate. Red squirrels also cache whitebark pine seeds; from 3 to 176 seeds per cache have been found (47). A few seeds probably fall onto favorable seedbeds near the parent trees. Rarely, seeds may be carried by snow avalanches into lower elevations. Because of periodic disturbances and cold air drainage in avalanche chutes, whitebark pine saplings often occupy these sites at low elevations. Presumably, most of these trees arise from nutcracker caches. The poor germination rate (8 to 14 percent) of whitebark pine seed under field conditions is apparently related to the development and condition of the embryo and to seed coat factors (60). Seeds from three Canadian sources germinated poorly, despite a variety of seed coat scarification techniques with and without cold stratification (68). The best results were obtained when a small cut was made in the heavy seed coat and the seed was placed adjacent to germination paper to facilitate water uptake. The seed coat is evidently a major cause of delayed regeneration or seed dormancy. Another factor explaining the low germination was the low proportion of seeds with fully developed embryos. In another test, using seed collected from Idaho, 61 percent of the seed germinated after clipping of the seed coat (67). Stratification for 60 days plus clipping resulted in 91 percent germination. Cold stratification for at least 150 days followed by cracking of the seed coat has been fairly successful, resulting in 34 percent germination (37). Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (81). The newly germinated seedlings of whitebark pine are large compared with other mountain conifers. Cotyledons number 7 to 9 (36), and while still in the cotyledon stage, the seedlings are 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in) tall, with a 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in) taproot (25). Vegetative Reproduction- Unlike associated subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock, whitebark pine spreads only to a minor extent through layering-rooting of lower branches that are pressed against moist ground. At the upper elevational limit of tree growth, whitebark pine forms islands of shrub-like growth (flagged krummholz and cushion krummholz, similar in general appearance to the layered krummholz of fir and spruce described by Marr (55). A recent inspection of whitebark pine krummholz in the Montana Bitterroot Range confirmed that layering occurs (5). Investigation revealed that much of the spread of an individual krummholz plant results from branches extending horizontally from a central point, but also that in some plants these long branches become pressed into the surface soil and have developed large roots, which clearly constitutes layering. Whitebark pine is easily grafted on rootstock of either whitebark pine or western white pine. The grafts grow much faster when the stock plant is western white pine (44).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,13,1
"Growth and Yield- Whitebark pine is a slow-growing, long-lived tree. It can attain small to moderately large size after 250 or more years depending on site conditions. Growth and yield information on this species is scarce because it is of little interest for commercial timber production. Occasionally, old growth whitebark pine makes up a modest proportion of the timber harvested on moist, high-elevation sites. In Montana, the best sites for whitebark pine timber growth are generally in the Abies lasiocarpa/Luzula hitchcockii habitat type, Menziesia ferruginea phase (66). Although whitebark pines of good form and moderately large size [dominant trees 50 to 75 cm (20 to 30 in) in d.b.h. and 21 to 30 m (70 to 100 ft) tall at 250 to 300 years of age] sometimes develop on these sites, associated Engelmann spruce grows larger and is the primary object of management. In some commercial forest sites between 1520 and 1830 m (5,000 and 6,000 ft) in southwestern Alberta, whitebark pine grows larger than associated lodgepole pine and spruce (25). In south-central Oregon, annual yields of merchantable timber in a lodgepole pine-whitebark pine type were estimated to be about 2.0 m³/ha (29 ft³/acre) (41). On the best sites, where whitebark pine is a component of the spruce-subalpine fir forest, it produces timber of good quality with only a moderate amount of defect. The resulting lumber has properties similar to those of western white pine (45) but is graded lower largely because of its slightly darker appearance (85). At higher elevations where the species is abundant, it forms a short tree with large branches and is unsuitable for timber production. Detailed information on productivity in some of the pure, high-elevation whitebark pine stands- Pinus albicaulis/Vaccinium scoparium habitat type suggests that annual yields of merchantable timber are low, about 0.7 to 1.4 m³/ha (10 to 20 ft³/acre) (27,83,66). On favorable sites near the forest line, this species develops into a large, single-trunk tree commonly 11 to 20 in (35 to 65 ft) tall and has a life span of 500 years or more. The oldest individuals on some cold, dry sites probably attain 1,000 years. The ancient trees often have a broad crown composed of large ascending branch-trunks. The largest recorded whitebark pine, growing in central Idaho's Sawtooth Range, is 267 cm (8 ft 9 in) in d.b.h. and 21 m (69 ft) tall (2). Upwards through the timberline zone, whitebark pine becomes progressively shorter and assumes multi-stemmed growth forms, evidently arising from the germination of nutcracker seed caches (30,52). Because seeds in these caches often come from the same tree, the individual trees that make up a single multi-stemmed tree are often siblings. As a result, tree ""clumps"" may be composed of individuals more closely related to one another than to adjacent clumps. At its upper limits, whitebark pine is reduced to shrublike growth forms (20). Such krummholz stands are often extensive on wind-exposed slopes and ridgetops. Primary causes of krummholz are thought to be inadequate growing season warmth, which prevents adequate growth, maturation, and hardening (cuticle development) of new shoots (79). As a result, shoots are easily killed by frost or by heating and desiccation on warm sunny days in early spring when the soil and woody stems are frozen and thus little water is available to replace transpiration losses. Mechanical damage from ice particles in the wind is also a factor limiting krummholz growth to microsites where snowpack accumulates and provides protection from sun and wind. Rooting Habit- On most sites, whitebark pine develops a deep and spreading root system. It is well anchored into the rocky substrate and is seldom uprooted despite its large, exposed crown and the violent winds to which it is subjected. Lanner (50), however, observed shallow rooting that allowed windthrow in whitebark pines growing on moraines in Wyoming. These trees had pancake like root systems only 40 cm (16 in) deep. Shallow rooting probably occurs also where the species inhabits high-elevation bogs. Reaction to Competition- Although whitebark pine has been tentatively rated very intolerant of competition or shade (12), recent observers (8,25,60,66,71) believe that it is intermediate or intolerant, about equivalent to western white pine or interior Douglas-fir. Whitebark pine is less tolerant than subalpine fir, spruce, and mountain hemlock; however, it is more tolerant than lodgepole pine and alpine larch. In moist, wind-sheltered sites where spruce, fir, or hemlock are capable of forming a closed stand, whitebark pine can become a long-lived seral dominant in the aftermath of fires, snow avalanches, or blowdowns. On a broad range of dry, wind-exposed sites, whitebark pine is a climax or near-climax species that persists indefinitely in association with subalpine fir and other tolerant species because it is hardier, more drought tolerant, more durable, and longer-lived. Even on these severe sites, however, a successional trend may be observable on a small scale: whitebark pine pioneers on an open site and is later surrounded and locally replaced by tolerant fir and hemlock (29). In dry areas of Wyoming's Wind River and in south-central Oregon, whitebark pine forms a co-climax with lodgepole pine in dense subalpine forest stands (41,72). Observations of whitebark pine natural regeneration suggest that this species could be perpetuated on dry sites under a variety of even-aged or uneven-aged silvicultural systems. To establish whitebark pine on moist sites, some stand opening and light, localized site preparation are probably necessary. Wind-throw and wind breakage are a danger to residual trees, especially spruce and fir, in partial cuttings. Watershed values (and often esthetic values) are high on whitebark pine sites, however, and use of heavy equipment could be damaging. Whitebark pine can be regenerated by outplanting seedlings, or sowing seeds in mineral soil or at the soil-litter interface (60). Damaging Agents- Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is by far the most damaging insect in mature stands of whitebark pine (13). Much of the mature whitebark pine in the northern Rockies was killed by this insect between 1909 and 1940 (3,19,31). Epidemics evidently spread upward into the whitebark pine forest after becoming established in the lodgepole pine forests below. In the 1970's, an epidemic developing in lodgepole pine in the Flathead National Forest of Montana killed most of the whitebark pine in some areas. This insect usually kills only the larger whitebark pine trees because such trees have an inner bark layer thick enough for the larvae to inhabit. Small trees are also killed in areas of intense infestation. Less damaging insect infestations are caused by aphids (Essigella gillettei) that feed on needles, mealybugs (Puto cupressi and P. pricei) that feed on trunks and branches, and the lodgepole needletier (Argyrotaenia tabulana), a potentially destructive defoliator. At least one species of Ips, the Monterey pine Ips (Ips mexicanus), infests the bole, and Pityogenes carinulatus and P. fossifrons also infest the bole (31). Two species of Pityophthorus (P. aquilonius and P. collinus) have been collected from whitebark pine (18). The ponderosa pine cone beetle (Conophthorus ponderosae) infests cones of whitebark pine (86). The principal disease is the introduced white pine blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola) (38). Blister rust is particularly destructive where the ranges of whitebark pine and blister rust coincide with good conditions for infection. This occurs where adequate moisture permits infection of local Ribes spp. (currant and gooseberry bushes, the rust's alternate hosts) in early summer and prevents drying of the infected Ribes leaves throughout the summer. Where there is a source of inoculum from lowland forests, the spores that infect pine can be carried by wind to the trees, but cool, moist conditions are needed for infection (14). Blister rust damage is severe and prevents tree development in some timberline areas of the northern Cascades, northern Idaho, and northwestern Montana where whitebark pine is the major pioneer species (48). (Resistance is discussed under ""genetics"".) Several other diseases infect whitebark pine, generally with minor consequences (34,35,69). These diseases are stem infections that produce cankers (some similar to blister rust), such as Atropellis pinicola, A. piniphila, Lachnellula pini (Dasyscypha pini), and Gremmeniella abietina; a wood rot organism Phellinus pini; several root and butt rots caused by Heterobasidion annosum, Phaeolus schweinitzii, and Poria subacida; and several needle cast fungi including Lophodermium nitens, L. pinastri, Bifusella linearis, and B. saccata. When foliage is covered by snow for long periods, a snow mold, Neopeckia coulteri, appears (34,35,69). The dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) cause severe local mortality. The most widespread species is the limber pine dwarf mistletoe (A. cyanocarpum), which causes extensive damage to whitebark pine on Mount Shasta and some nearby areas of northern California (56). In the northern Rockies, the lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe (A. americanum) occasionally occurs on whitebark pine where this tree grows in infested lodgepole pine stands. In the Oregon Cascades, the hemlock dwarf mistletoe (A. tsugense) is damaging to whitebark pine (33,56). In addition to these parasitic organisms, several harmless saprophytes grow on whitebark pine: Lachnellula pini (Dasyscypha agassizii) on dead bark and cankers of blister rust, D. arida, Tympanis pinastri, and Phoma harknessii on twigs (34). Cenococcum graniforme has been identified as an ectotrophic mycorrhizal fungus of whitebark pine (80). Wildfire is an important vegetation recycling force in whitebark pine stands, although long intervals (50 to 300 years or more depending on the site) usually occur between fires in a given grove (4). Lightning has been the major cause of fires in most stands; however, increased recreational use of forests results in accidental fires. Many of the fires have spread upslope into whitebark pine after developing in lower forests. Tiny spot fires are most common because fuels are generally sparse and conditions moist and cool. Nevertheless, occasional warm and dry periods accompanied by strong winds allow fires to spread. Spreading fires often remain on the surface and kill few large trees, but, under extreme conditions, severe wind-driven fires burn large stands (4). Wildfire (enhanced by fuels created by epidemics of Dendroctonus ponderosae in lodgepole and whitebark pine), followed by seed dissemination by Clark's nutcrackers, may be the principal means by which whitebark pine becomes established in the more productive sites near its lower elevational limits. Conversely, after a severe fire on dry, wind-exposed sites, regeneration of whitebark pine (often the pioneer species) may require several decades (6,77). Wind breakage of the crowns or holes occurs when unusually heavy loads of wet snow or ice have accumulated on the foliage. This damage is prevalent in large, old trees having extensive heart rot. Snow avalanches also are an important damaging agent in some whitebark pine stands.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,14,1
"Most whitebark pine stands grow on weakly developed (immature) soils. Many of the sites were covered by extensive mountain glaciers during the Pleistocene and have been released from glacial ice for less than 12,000 years (62). Chemical weathering is retarded by the short, cool, summer season. Also, nitrogen-fixing and other microbiotic activity that might enrich the soil is apparently restricted by low soil temperature and high acidity on many sites. Despite these general trends, substantial variations occur in local climates, geologic substrates, and degrees of soil development in whitebark pine habitats. Thus, several types of soils have been recognized. Most soils under whitebark pine stands are classified as Inceptisols (82). Many of these are Typic Cryochrepts, although deposits of volcanic ash may be sufficiently thick in some profiles to warrant recognition as Andic Cryochrepts. Some of the best-developed, ash-layered soils beneath spruce-fir/whitebark pine stands are Typic Cryandepts similar to the zonal Brown Podzolic soils (64). All of these are young soils, showing less leaching, weathering, and horizon development than Spodosols, although they are strongly acidic. Mean pH values of 4.8 to 5.0 were found for the upper mineral soil horizons in three habitat types, probably composed largely of Typic Cryochrepts (66). Data on nutrient availability in these soils have been provided (83). Throughout its distribution, whitebark pine is often found on soils lacking fine material. Sparse open stands often grow on coarse talus, exposed bedrock, or lava flows having minimal horizon development and only scattered pockets of fine material. These soils would be classified as fragmental and loamy skeletal families within the order Entisols (Cryorthents in granitic substrates) (82). They have been referred to as azonal soils, and more specifically as Lithosols in earlier classifications. Some dry-site whitebark pine stands in semiarid regions have open, grassy understories, particularly on calcareous rock substrates. The soils have a thick, dark surface horizon and a nearly neutral reaction. The pH is near 6 in Montana (66) and Idaho (71) stands, but in Alberta average values are 7.8 to 8 (9). These soils would evidently be classified as Typic Cryoborolls within the order Mollisols (82). Also, in some of the same areas, soils that have a dark surface but low base saturation are classified as Typic Cryumbrepts. In all but the driest regions, whitebark pine is most abundant on warm aspects and ridgetops having direct exposure to sun and wind. It is less abundant on sheltered, north-facing slopes and in cirque basins, where subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), mountain hemlock, or alpine larch (Larix lyallii) become prevalent. Nevertheless, the tallest and best formed whitebark pine trees are. often found in high basins or on gentle north slopes. Near the northern end of its distribution in the British Columbia coastal mountains, whitebark pine is a minor component of timberline communities at about 1580 m (5,200 ft) elevation (58). In the Olympic Mountains and on the western slope of the Cascades in Washington and northern Oregon, it grows primarily on exposed sites near tree line between 1770 and 2130 m (5,800 and 7,000 ft). (Elevational ranges mentioned are mostly from 7). East of the Cascade crest it becomes abundant within both the subalpine forest and the timberline zone. For instance, it is common between 1620 and 2440 m (5,300 and 8,000 ft) in central Washington's Stuart Range, generally forming krummholz above 2130 m (7,000 ft). The lowest reported natural stand of whitebark pine throughout its range is at 1100 m (3,600 ft) near Government Camp on the southwest slope of Mount Hood in Oregon (28). Whitebark pine becomes a major component of high-elevation forests in the Cascades of southern Oregon and northern California, growing between 2440 and 2900 m (8,000 and 9,500 ft) on Mount Shasta. In the central and southern Sierra Nevada it is found between 3050 and 3510 m (10,000 and 11,500 ft) but occasionally reaches 3660 m (12,000 ft) as krummholz cushions. Near the north end of its distribution in the Rockies of Alberta and British Columbia, whitebark pine is generally small, scattered, and confined to dry, exposed sites at timberline, 1980 to 2290 m (6,500 to 7,500 ft). It becomes increasingly abundant southward, especially in Montana and central Idaho. It is a major component of high-elevation forests and the timberline zone between about 1800 and 2500 m (5,900 and 8,200 ft) in northwestern Montana and 2130 and 2830 m (7,000 and 9,300 ft) in west-central Montana. In western Wyoming, it is abundant at 2440 to 3200 m (8,000 to 10,500 ft).",Soils and Topography,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,15,1
"Whitebark pine's greatest values are for wildlife habitat, watershed protection, and esthetics. Seeds are an important, highly nutritious food source for many seed eating birds and small mammals, as well as for black bears and grizzly bears (47,57,61). Blue grouse feed and roost in whitebark pine crowns during much of the year. This tree provides both hiding and thermal cover in sites where few if any other trees grow. The large, hollow trunks of old trees and snags provide homesites for cavity-nesting birds. The seeds of whitebark pine were occasionally used as a secondary food source by Native Americans (17,54). Whitebark pine helps to stabilize snow, soil, and rocks on steep terrain and has potential for use in land-reclamation projects at high elevation (68). It provides shelter and fuel for hikers and campers and is an important component of the picturesque setting that lures hundreds of thousands of visitors into the high mountains (21).",Special Uses,Whitebark Pine,pinus,albicaulis,conifer,16,1

"The climate in which willow oak grows is humid and temperate, characterized by long, hot summers and mild, short winters. It grows mainly in the zone where daily normal temperatures are above 0° C (32° F). Frost-free days number 180 to 190 in the north-northeastern range and 300 in the south-southwestern range (29). Average summer temperatures vary from 21° to 27° C (70° to 80° F), with extremes of 38° to 46° C (100° to 115° F). Average winter temperatures range from -4° to 13° C (25° to 55° F) with extremes to -29° C (-20° F). Average annual temperatures throughout the range are 10° to 21° C (50° to 70° F). Across the entire range, surface winds in the summer are off the Gulf of Mexico and winter winds are variable. Normally there are about 2,700 hours of sunshine annually in willow oak's range. Relative humidity at noon ranges from 60 to 70 percent in January and 50 to 70 percent in July. Annual precipitation varies from 1020 to 1520 mm (40 to 60 in) and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year; there is slightly more precipitation in the summer in the southeastern portion of the range. Greatest precipitation is in the central Gulf area. Average annual snowfall varies from 0 to 127 cm (0 to 50 in) over the range.

"Flowering and Fruiting- Willow oak is monoecious; male and female flowers are in separate catkins on the same tree. Staminate flowers are in slender yellow-green hairy catkins, pistillate flowers are tiny, in few flowered clusters at junction of leaf stems. Flowering occurs from February to May, about a week before the leaf buds open. Late freezes, after the flower and leaf buds have opened, kill the flowers and defoliate the trees. New leaves develop after the freeze, but a second crop of flowers is not produced. Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production starts when the tree is about 20 years old. The acorns are small, 10 to 15 mm (4 to 0.6 in) in length, about as broad as long, occurring solitary or in pairs (28). They mature between August and October of the second year after flowering. The first acorns to fall usually are not mature, as indicated by failure of the cup to detach easily. Good mature acorns are heavy and have a bright color with a brown micropylar end (3). Good seed crops are produced nearly every year. Mature trees produce between 9 and 53 liters (0.25 to 1.5 bu) or about 5.2 to 31.3 kg (11.5 to 69 lb) of acorns per year. Since willow oak averages 603 seeds per liter (21.250/bu) (27), the number of seeds per tree ranges from about 5,400 to 31,900. Seeds are disseminated by animals and, in areas subject to overflow, by water. Prolonged submersion of willow oak acorns reduces their germination ability slightly, but not enough to affect the species capability to regenerate an area (13). The acorns can be stored under moist, cold conditions. For germination, acorn moisture content must not drop below 40 percent; a 50 percent moisture content is preferable. Seeds should be stored at temperatures of 2° to 4° C (35° to 40° F) for 60 to 90 days before planting. Seedling Development- Seeds germinate the spring following seedfall. Germination is hypogeal (27). The best seedbed is a moist, well-aerated soil with an inch or more of leaf litter. Early height growth is moderate; on good sites in the southern part of the range, seedlings average 1.4 in (4.5 ft) in 2 years. Willow oak normally reproduces as a single tree or in very small groups. Reproduction occurs in small to large openings created either naturally or as a result of logging. Successful regeneration usually is the result of the presence of advance regeneration before the stand is disturbed. If willow oak regeneration does not exist on the ground before disturbance, there is little chance that successful regeneration of this species will occur. Seedlings are very intolerant of saturated soil conditions except during the dormant season, when they can tolerate complete submergence without appreciable mortality. After spring foliation, complete submergence longer than 5 to 7 days can be fatal, but seedling mortality usually does not occur unless saturation periods exceed 60 days (10). During saturation periods, some secondary roots are killed and no adventitious shoots are formed, height growth essentially halts. After the saturation period ends, growth of roots and shoots resumes. Although willow oak exhibits only medium tolerance to shade, seedlings may persist for as long as 30 years under a forest canopy. They continually die back and resprout. As a result they may become misshapen. These seedling-sprouts respond to release (12). Vegetative Reproduction- Willow oak readily sprouts from stumps of small trees. Sprouts from advance reproduction are a principal method of natural regeneration. Larger diameter stumps do not sprout readily. Cuttings taken from young parent trees can be propagated if treated with indoleacetic acid; success decreases with increasing age of the parent tree. Untreated cuttings fail completely. Layering and budding are not effective as a means of vegetative reproduction.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Willow Oak,quercus,phellos,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Willow oak is medium size to large, attaining 24 to 37 m (80 to 120 ft) in height and commonly 100 cm (39.5 in) in d.b.h. On good sites it makes moderately rapid growth. Diameter growth is dependent upon tree size. In unmanaged stands on good sites, trees 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) in d.b.h. averaged 6.6 cm (2.6 in) diameter growth in 10 years (18). In the 36 to 46 cm (14 to 18 in) class, they grew 7.9 cm (3.1 in) in 10 years; in the 51 to 71 cm (20 to 28 in) class, 7.1 cm (2.8 in). Dominant crop trees in a well-stocked managed stand probably average 8.9 to 10.2 cm (3.5 to 4.0 in) in d.b.h. growth in 10 years, with a maximum of 15.2 cm (6 in) (7,26). Willow oak commonly exists as a major component in mixed bottom-land stands. In a fairly typical stand near Stoneville, MS, willow oak basal area averages 7.1 m²/ha (31 ft³/acre) out of a total of 21.1 m²/ha (92.0 ft²/acre) (19). The same willow oak component of the stand averages 57 273 kg/ha (51,100 lb/acre) of total dry fiber, 64 percent of which is contained in the bole; 87 percent of the total is contained in trees larger than 43.2 cm (17 in). Willow oak has been successfully planted in stream bottoms or branch heads. After 17 years, trees averaged 10.9 cm (4.3 in) in d.b.h. and 14 m (46 ft) in height (6). Rooting Habit- Where it occurs on alluvial soils, willow oak feeder roots are concentrated in the aerated layer above free water. Here they form extensive ectomycorrhizal associations that aid the tree in taking up nutrients and water and offer some protection against root diseases. Roots do not penetrate into the zone of free-standing water. In the soil region of best growth, root growth usually begins during early March. Since complete soil saturation during the growing season inhibits root growth of seedlings, it probably has the same effect on mature trees. Production of ectomycorrhizae also is inhibited under saturated soil conditions, but once the excess soil moisture in the upper root zone dissipates, both root and mycorrhizae growth resume (9). Permanent standing water, however, kills the root system and ultimately the tree. Reaction to Competition- A straight, tall, slender trunk is common. Not a rapid pruner on good sites, it is a very ineffective natural pruner on poor sites. A tendency exists for the production of epicormic branches if the dormant buds along the main stem are stimulated to grow by some disturbance. Among the causal disturbances are breakage of the tree crown, wounding of the stem, drought, flooding, suppression, and unsuitable sites (16). Release stimulates epicormic branching on intermediate or suppressed trees, but dominant or codominant trees are much less susceptible. Thinning should aim at releasing undamaged trees pole size and larger that occupy dominant and codominant positions. Although slow to heal from artificial pruning, live-branch wounds initially heal more rapidly than dead-branch wounds, but up to 4 years are required for healing more than 96 percent of either kind of wound (11). Willow oak is a subclimax species and is classed as intolerant of shade. All trees, except those of poor vigor, respond well to release. Damaging Agents- Squirrels, birds, and insects (mainly acorn weevils) reduce the fruit crop, as do hogs. A principal enemy of willow oak is fire. Seedlings and saplings are killed by even a light burn; hot fires kill larger trees. Trees not immediately killed by the fire are often wounded and become susceptible to butt rot fungi. A common canker on bottom-land willow oaks is caused by Polyporus hispidus (25). This insidious fungus grows rapidly, cankers lengthening 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) per year, and may cause as much as 25 percent cull in some areas. Cankered trees should be removed as soon as possible, both to salvage the log and to remove the tree as a source of infection (15). Perhaps the most serious insect pests are the trunk borers. They cause serious degrade in saw log quality. Three of the more common are the red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), carpenterworm (Prionoxystus robiniae), and living-beech borer (Goes pulverulentus) (23,24). Willow oak has been shown to be susceptible to acid rain, the foliage showing yellow or brown necrotic zones when exposed to simulated rain of less than 3.2 pH (20).",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Willow Oak,quercus,phellos,hardwood,14,0
"Willow oak grows on a variety of alluvial soils and is found on ridges and high flats on first bottoms of major streams. On second bottoms it grows on ridges, flats, and sloughs and can be very common in some minor stream bottoms. It develops best on clay loam ridges of new alluvium. Studies show that site quality of willow oak decreases from the higher to the lower topographic positions within a floodplain. Willow oak is rarely found on upland sites but is occasionally seen on hardpan areas of very old terraces and on hammocks or bays. Trees on these sites are usually of poor quality. In addition to topography, willow oak quality and growth rate are affected by soil characteristics and available moisture. In the Mississippi Delta, site quality decreases within each topographic position as clay content 30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) below the soil surface increases. For the non-Delta region in the South, site quality decreases within a topographic position as available potassium in the top 15 cm (6 in) of soil increases (26). The best soils for willow oak growth are those that are deep (more than 1.2 in or 4 ft), without a pan, and relatively undisturbed (1). They are medium textured, silty or loamy, with no compaction in the surface for 30 cm (12 in) and are granular in the rooting zone below. In contrast, the worst soils are shallow, have an inherent pan, or have been intensively cultivated for more than 20 years. They are fine textured, clayey, with a strongly compacted surface for 30 cm (12 in) and have a massive structure in the rooting zone. Moisture must be readily available in the soil during the growing season for best willow oak growth. The ideal water table depth is 0.6 to 1.8 in (2 to 6 ft), while depths less than 0.3 in (I ft) and greater than 3 m (10 ft) are unsuitable. Radial growth is not affected by standing water during the growing season (February to July) (4) but is greatly increased if the water table is artificially raised by impoundments to within 1.2 in (4 ft) of the soil surface (5). For best growth, the topsoil should be at least 15 cm (6 in) deep, with more than 2 percent organic matter. Optimally, soil pH in the rooting zone should be 4.5 to 5.5. The site quality worsens as the topsoil becomes more shallow, organic matter decreases, and pH departs from optimum. The soils on which willow oak is most commonly found are in the orders Inceptisols and Alfisols.",Soils and Topography,Willow Oak,quercus,phellos,hardwood,15,0
"Since it produces an acorn crop almost every year, willow oak is an important species for wildlife food production. In addition to being a major supplier of food for game animals such as ducks, squirrels, deer, and turkey, willow oak supplies many other animals. Blue jays and red-headed woodpeckers are major consumers, while grackles, flickers, mice, and flying squirrels utilize the tree itself (8). A favored shade tree, it is widely planted as an ornamental. It is also a good species to plant along margins of fluctuating-level reservoirs (21). Willow oak can be harvested when quite young and utilized as biomass (17). Pulp yields per unit volume of young versus old trees do not differ greatly and chemical demand in pulping is not greatly increased (2). Willow oak is being utilized in hardwood plantations, since it gives a good combination of pulping characteristics and growth rate.",Special Uses,Willow Oak,quercus,phellos,hardwood,16,0
"Winged elm generally grows only as scattered trees in mixture with other hardwoods (14).

"Flowering and Fruiting- The perfect flowers of winged elm are borne on threadlike pedicels in short, few-flowered drooping fascicles before the leaves appear in March and April (22). The fruit is a reddish or greenish samara, ovate to oblong and 6 to 8 mm (0.25 to 0.33 in) long. Fruits ripen in April and seeds are dispersed the same month (3). The seed is solitary and it and its wing are flat and hairy, especially on the margin. The reddish samaras give the tree a reddish appearance when fruiting. Seed Dissemination- Seeds are disseminated by wind and water. They are eaten by a variety of birds and small animals which likely serve as another means of dissemination. Seedling Development- Germination is epigeal (3). The cotyledons are oval with shallowly notched apexes and heart-shaped bases (9). They are light green and smooth on both surfaces and persist on the plant for 1 to 2 months. The first leaves appear within 1 week after germination. They are small and sharp-pointed and have typical elm venation. The stem is circular, zig-zag, and slightly hairy to smooth. Two corky wings develop opposite each other on the stem late in the first year. The buds are slender and sharp-pointed, chestnut brown, slightly hairy, and 1.6 mm (0.06 in) long. Winged elm is a light-demanding species and reproduction is often sparse in an understory (1). It is an invader of forest openings, old fields, and rangelands. It survives grazing as bushes and sprouts prolifically (15). Winged elm is difficult to kill with herbicides and its eradication has been the subject of several rangeland studies during the past decade (18). Vegetative Reproduction- No information is currently available on the sprouting and rooting habits of winged elm.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Winged Elm,ulmus,alata,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Winged elm is a mediumsized tree, usually 12 to 15 m (40 to 50 ft) in height but occasionally 24 to 30 m (80 to 100 ft), and is rarely more than 61 cm (24 in) in d.b.h. This species develops a short bole with branches ascending into a fairly open, round-topped crown. It has a lacy, or somewhat drooping habit. One special characteristic is the corky, persistent wings or projections often found on the branches. Winged elm grows rapidly in the open. Under forest conditions its growth rate is usually considered poor in relation to its associates. Diameter growth in a natural stand averages 50 to 64 mm (2.0 to 2.5 in) in 10 years (12). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Of all species of elms native to the United States, winged elm is perhaps the least tolerant of shade. It is, nevertheless, classed as a shade tolerant species (15). Normally, winged elm is not associated with standing water except in intermittent pools and shallow sheets of water after heavy rains. Winged elm is classified as tolerant of flooding (19). Damaging Agents- A large variety of insects and diseases are reported for winged elm (2,7,8). This is not because the species is generally more susceptible to pathogens than other native hardwoods. The primary reason is that the species is susceptible to Ceratocystis u1mi, which causes Dutch elm disease, and to the mycoplasmalike organism which causes elm phloem necrosis. Both have been devastating to the elms native to North America and since these diseases are both transmitted by insects, a large amount of research has been done on all insects and diseases of elms in the United States. The Dutch elm disease is most prevalent across the northern portion of the natural range of winged elm. As of 1976, it had not been found in Louisiana and Florida (21). Phloem necrosis was distributed throughout much of the north and central range of winged elm by 1975 (6). Both diseases have spread into the Southeastern States from the north; whether or not the warmer climate or other factors in these States will eventually stop the epidemics remains uncertain.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Winged Elm,ulmus,alata,hardwood,14,0
"Winged elm is found on a great variety of soils. It grows fairly well on dry as well as on rich, moist soils. The species does particularly well in the silty uplands in Mississippi where site index values at base age 50 years are 21.3 to 27.4 rn (70 to 90 ft) on Memphis soils (4). On the Delta bottom lands it grows on terrace flats with tight silty soils of the order Inceptisols. In southern Illinois, it grows in old abandoned fields and along fence rows on upland clay soils. The species is generally associated with intermittent streams and other moist, lower slope sites. In the hill country of Tennessee and North Carolina, it may be found on upper or middle slopes, however. It is listed in forest types that are found at elevations up to 760 m (2,500 ft). The species is also common on sandy soils in bottom lands near Dallas, TX (11).

"For commercial purposes the wood of winged elm is classed as hard elm or rock elm (5,13). Elm wood is used principally for furniture, hardwood dimension and flooring, boxes, and crates. Elm's excellent resistance to splitting has made it a choice wood for the manufacture of high quality hockey sticks. The manufacture of furniture continues to increase the demand for elm for bent parts of chairs such as rockers and arms. The mast from winged elm is eaten by birds and animals, and the twigs and leaves are important for white-tailed deer (16). Both twigs and leaves are most succulent, nutritious, and digestible during spring and are less useful as food the rest of the year because after abscission, the leaves lose most of their quality and digestibility.",Special Uses,Winged Elm,ulmus,alata,hardwood,16,0
"Vegetative morphology of yagrumo hembra throughout the islands of the Caribbean differs from that of mainland (Central and South America) representatives of the same species. On the mainland, yagrumo hembra maintains a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants. The species Azteca constrictor and A. alfaroi have been reported from Venezuela (27). There the tree also has adaptations, such as a trichilium or highly modified petiole bases that produce mullerian bodies or food bodies rich in glycogen. The stinging, aggressive ants live in the hollow internodes and feed upon glycogen produced by the tree. Neither the adaptations nor the ants are present on trees in Puerto Rico. In the Caribbean islands from Trinidad to Puerto Rico there is a progressive loss of these ant-related traits (25). Mainland individuals maintain trichilia in the greenhouse; these appear to be genetic traits and do not depend on ant stimulation for development (14,25). Approximately 80 species of the genus Cecropia have been described; however, only one species is found on the islands of the Caribbean. A chromosome number of 2n=28 has been reported (27). Velazquez (27) consolidated three Venezuelan Cecropia species into a variety of C. peltata: Cecropia peltata L. var. candida. Recently, Howard (14) describes Puerto Rican species as Cecropia schreberiana rather than C. peltata, stating that the latter is restricted to mainland Central and South America and Jamaica. C. schreberiana is mentioned as occurring throughout the remainder of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. Some place it in its own family, cecropiaceae, with the genus Cecropia as the type genus.",Genetics,"Yagrumo Hembra, Trumpet-Tree",cecropia,peltata,hardwood,7,0
"Yagrumo hembra is also native throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles and in Central America from Yucatan, Mexico, to Costa Rica. In South America it has been reported from Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and the Guianas (19). In Puerto Rico, yagrumo hembra is found most frequently in the wetter life zones: Subtropical Moist Forest, with 990 to 2010 mm (39 to 79 in) of precipitation annually; Subtropical Wet Forest, with 2010 to 3990 mm (79 to 157 in); Subtropical Rain Forest, with 3810 mm (150 in) and greater; Subtropical Lower Montane Rain Forest, with 2010 to 3990 mm (79 to 157 in); and Subtropical Lower Montane Wet Forest, with 3810 mm (150 in) and greater. Mean annual temperatures in the lower montane life zones range from 12° to 18° C (54° to 64° F), whereas in the lower elevation life zones the range is from 18° to 24° C (64° to 75° F). The species is rare or absent in the Subtropical Dry Forest life zone. Yagrumo hembra grows on the Ultisols of the central and eastern mountains of Puerto Rico, the Mollisols and Alfisols of the limestone hills of the northwest, the Oxisols of the western mountains underlain by serpentine, and also the Mollisols and Inceptisols of the northern coastal plain. It is found from 50 to 1300 in (164 to 4,265 ft) in elevation on ridges, slopes, and flats but appears to be at its optimum in coves or protected areas. It is often found on steep slopes where landslides or tree falls have occurred, and in these areas its prop or stilt roots may be conspicuous. Yagrumo hembra grows on alluvial, colluvial, and residual soils neutral to acidic in nature. These soils may be derived from tuffs; volcanic rock, andesitic or dioritic in composition; limestone; or serpentine. Soil texture may range from heavy clay to sandy, but a clay-loam soil is optimal. As a secondary species, yagrumo hembra frequently invades forest gaps or openings, roadsides, streamsides, and landslides in moist, wet, and rain forest life zones of Puerto Rico. In the Luquillo Mountains in eastern Puerto Rico and in the central mountains it is widely distributed in the Lower Montane Forest, Montane Rain Forest, and Elfin Woodland formations of these life zones (1). In the Elfin Woodland it is short in stature and gnarled, as are its associated species in this formation. Yagrumo hembra is frequently associated with other secondary species such as yagrumo macho (Didymopanax morototoni) and guano (Ochroma pyramidale). The scattered presence of this secondary species among species more characteristic of a mature stand indicates that a disturbance, such as tree fall, storm damage, or landslide, occurred at some time in the past. Although initially dependent upon the size of the openings, pure dense stands of yagrumo hembra, once established, may persist for several years following the disturbance. The species may also be found, in a dominant or codominant canopy position, associated with primary species such as tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), motillo (Sloanea berteriana), and ausubo (Manilkara bidentata) in the Lower Montane Rain Forest; palo colorado (Cyrilla racemiflora), caimitillo (Micropholis chrysophylloides), and camasey jusillo (Calycogonium squamulosum) in the Montane Rain Forest; and roble de sierra (Tabebuia rigida) and nemoca (Ocotea spathulata) in the Elfin Woodland. Yagrumo hembra is less common in the hotter lowlands of Puerto Rico. Here it may be an infrequent component of succession primarily on the wetter sites following cultivation, associated with the secondary species listed above as well as with many introduced species. In the mogotes or limestone hills of northwestern Puerto Rico, yagrumo hembra is associated with those secondary species described previously as well as others such as ucar (Bucida buceras), almacigo (Bursera simaruba), and espino rubial (Zanthoxylum martinicense).",Habitat,"Yagrumo Hembra, Trumpet-Tree",cecropia,peltata,hardwood,8,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Yagrumo hembra is dioecious, with staminate flowers borne in slender, stalked aments 5 to 6 cm (2.0 to 2.4 in) in length, arranged in clusters of as many as 15, and pistillate flowers in thicker, stalkless aments grouped in clusters of only 2 to 5. Both staminate and pistillate trees may be observed in flower and fruit all year long; however, a peak flowering and fruiting period occurs in Puerto Rico during the months of January to March, the drier season. This is also the period of minimum temperatures and minimum day-length (8,26). A winter flowering and fruiting peak for yagrumo hembra has also been noted in San Pedro de Montes de Oca (1200 m or 3,937 ft) in Costa Rica (9). The slightly fleshy multiple fruit is at maturity gray-green in color and may be 10 cm (4 in) in length and 15 mm (0.6 in) in diameter. It is composed of numerous individual fruits, pentangular or hexangular in shape, each of which contains one brown seed of about 2 mm (0.08 in) in length. There are 2,500 seeds per gram (70,875/oz), air dried. The extraction factor for seeds is about 20 percent, because of the gummy material surrounding each seed (16). Maturation, from emergence of the inflorescence from the terminal bud to full ripening, requires from 3.5 to 4 months. Staminate inflorescences remain on the tree for only 1.5 months and produce copious amounts of wind-borne pollen approximately 1 to 1.5 months following emergence from the terminal bud (26). Seed Production and Dissemination- Although as many as 15,000 flowers may be produced per inflorescence, the number of seeds that mature fully may be as low as 18 percent, or 2,725 viable seeds per inflorescence. Seed production by a mature tree during one reproductive year has been estimated to be as high as I million (13,26). Seed production is size or age specific, however, and increases throughout the lifetime of the tree. In an estimated life span of 30 years, as many as 6 to 7 million seeds may be produced by a single tree. Reproductive maturity is reached at an earlier age, 3 or 4 years by pistillate than by staminate trees, which mature at 4 to 5 years. Reproductive age may depend upon need for allocation of resources to rapid initial height growth and therefore the height and proximity to surrounding vegetation. Roadside trees, in a more open environment, reached reproductive maturity sooner (3 to 4 years) than forest gap trees (5 to 6 years) (26). Seed production probably decreases as a tree approaches the senescent state. In this stage there appears to be an increase in branch loss. Seeds are dispersed primarily by bats and birds (3,7,11,18,24); seeds pass through the digestive tracts unharmed (24). In Puerto Rico, 15 species of birds and bats have been reported to feed on mature yagrumo hembra fruit. Some of the more common species include the Jamaican fruit eating bat, the banana quit, the pearly-eyed thrasher, the red-legged thrush, and the reina mora (18,26). These species frequent both open and forested areas, so that seeds are dispersed widely and are available in forest soil in the event of a disturbance (12). As many as 398 seeds per square meter (37/ft²) have been reported to be present in undisturbed lower montane rain forest soil (2,26). Blum (3) reported that yagrumo hembra seedlings grew in 4 to 10 soil samples taken from mature forests in Panama. Other secondary species such as yagrumo macho, cachimbo comun (Psychotria berteriana), and guano were also present in these soils. Seeds may also be dispersed when the entire fruit cluster falls to the ground upon ripening, but these seeds show a reduced viability as the embryos are damaged by fungi and insects of the family Nitidulidae. Laboratory- stored seeds retained viability for a minimum of 6 months, whereas seeds stored on the forest floor retained viability for only 2 to 3 months. This reduced viability under natural conditions indicates that a constant addition of seeds to the seed bank of the forest floor is necessary for rapid and successful colonization of a forest gap. Seedling Development- Seeds require full sunlight for successful germination. Thus, seeds present on the floor of closed forests germinate only when some type of canopy gap occurs. Given full light conditions, germination may be as high as 80 to 90 percent (3,16,26). Germination is epigeal and in an open field was shown to be reduced by the presence of a layer of leaf litter. Other factors that may interact with increased light intensity in promoting germination include higher surface soil temperatures, fluctuations in air temperature, and changes in soil moisture. With the decreased light intensity beneath the closed forest canopy, spectral composition (an increased proportion of infrared light) may also become critical to germination (26). A decreased ratio of infrared to red light has been shown to inhibit germination of successional species. In open fields there was less yagrumo hembra seed germination than was observed in light gaps. This may result from the extremely high and fluctuating surface soil temperatures or to fluctuating but frequently low soil moisture, or both (table 1). ¹Values are means for all months, August 1977 to January 1878 (25). In the nursery, seed is germinated under light shade on a seedbed prepared from equal parts of clay, sand, and filter press cake. Light shade is maintained until seedlings shade the germination media (16). Seedling leaves are distinct from those of the mature plant. They are downy on both surfaces, lanceolate, unlobed, and finely toothed. In the early sapling stage, 0.5 m (1.6 ft) tall, leaves begin to show signs of lobing. Ultimately, new leaves have 7 to 11 palmate lobes and resemble those of the mature plant, dark green and scabrous above and covered with a dense surface of white hairs below. Seedlings grow rapidly in height, reaching 10.0 to 15.0 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) in 10 weeks (16) and as much as 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in the first year (21). The ratio of photosynthesis to respiration of yagrumo hembra seedlings has been reported to be much greater than 1 (20). Under natural conditions, seedling mortality may be extremely high. In a forest opening, 99 percent of germinating seedlings may die within the first year. This is the life stage during which the greatest mortality occurs. During nursery trials, volunteer seedlings suffered 45 percent mortality during the first 9 months (10). However, seedlings transferred when 25.0 to 60.0 cm (9.8 to 23.6 in) in height to the field following a 2-week shaded period and gradual diminishing of shade showed a survival of as high as 80 percent. In 7 months they had reached 2.0 m (6.6 ft) in height (16). -Survivorship curve for yagrumo hembra. A is based on disturbed areas; B is based on life cycle stages (26). Growth in height is most rapid during the first 4 to 5 years, but the tree grows relatively little in diameter during the same period (6). In the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico, maximum seedling height growth under natural conditions was 1.14 in (3.7 ft) and the mean 0.73 m (2.4 ft) per year. Maximum diameter growth measured immediately above the root collar was 5 mm (0.20 in) and the mean growth was 3.6 mm (0. 14 in) during an 8 month period (26). Seedlings which are overtopped and thus shaded for extended periods of time do not survive for long. Potted seedlings transferred from a forest gap to closed forest died within several months and showed little if any growth. Potted seedlings remaining in the gap exhibited 100 percent survival as well as diameter and height increases. A disturbed area that is invaded rapidly by grasses, ferns, or vines shows a decreased density of yagrumo hembra during the seedling and sapling stages (26). Vegetative Reproduction- Yagrumo hembra sprouts easily. Growth and Yield- The sapling life stage begins when lobing of new leaves increases. Diameter growth of nonsuppressed saplings is significantly faster than that of seedlings. At an elevation of 400 m (1,312 ft) in the eastern mountains of Puerto Rico, saplings grow a maximum of 3.0 cm (1.2 in) and a mean of 6.5 mm. (0.26 in) in diameter per year. Mean growth in d.b.h., as opposed to maximum d.b.h. growth, is low due to the presence of numerous suppressed saplings in the dense stands which often occur following disturbance. These saplings grow as much as 2.16 m (7.1 ft) in height per year (26). A method has been developed for determining the age of yagrumo hembra based on past height growth (6). The tree has conspicuous rings and large triangular leaf scars at each node. Turrialba, where the study was conducted, has a distinct dry season, and internodes are arranged in short and long series. Short internodes represent growth during the drier season and long internodes growth during the wetter season. Annual height growth was found to be faster in wetter (5.9 m or 19.3 ft and 7.6 m or 24.9 ft) than in drier (1.9 in or 6.2 ft and 2.4 m or 7.9 ft) regions. It should be stressed that this method is only reliable for trees less than 5 years in age as height growth slows significantly later in life (6). Another method for aging yagrumo hembra is based on regressions of height and diameter on age. Since this method was developed for young trees and uses mean d.b.h. and mean height of a stand, it may more accurately estimate stand than individual age (26). -Estimation of age of yagrumo hembra from diameter adn height. A = regression of age of disturbed area on mean height (solid dot). Y = 0.91 + 1.3X, r² = 0.8. B = regression of age of disturbed area on mean d.b.h. (open dot). Y = 0.90 + 0.86X, r² = 0.9 (26). Periodic diameter growth of 4.6 to 5.1 mm. (0.18 and 0.20 in) was measured for yagrumo hembra (5). Growth rates were among the slowest measured in the Luquillo Mountains. A mean annual growth rate in d.b.h. of 2.0 mm (0.08 in) has been reported for mature yagrumo hembra trees (23) and an annual diameter growth rate of 6.4 mm (0.25 in) was measured in mature dominant trees (26). Once yagrumo hembra trees reach maturity, diameter growth appears to decrease. Growth is greatly improved by a dominant crown position, but little difference is found among codominant, intermediate, and suppressed trees. Trees in plantations reach a diameter of 25.0 cm (9.8 in) and a height of 14.0 m (45.9 ft) in 21 years (25). Height growth in yagrumo hembra predominates over diameter growth (23). This pattern fits well the ecological role of yagrumo hembra as a gap species. In the Luquillo Mountains, the density of yagrumo hembra in the tabonuco forest association (Subtropical Wet) is 83 trees per hectare (34/acre), and at a higher elevation in the Colorado forest association (Lower Montane Wet) it is 17 trees/ha (7 trees/acre) (28). Yagrumo hembra had a mean basal area of 18.3 to 22.9 m² /ha (79.7 to 99.7 ft²/acre) in the tabonuco forest (16). In a 2-ha (4.9-acre) sample of tabonuco forest, approximately 25 percent of the trees were 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) in d.b.h, 26 percent were 15 to 20 cm (5.9 to 7.9 in), 20 percent were 20 to 25 cm (7.9 to 9.8 in), and 13 percent were 25 to 30 cm (9.8 to 11.8 in). Only 6 percent had diameters of greater than 50 cm (19.7 in). Trees reach canopy height at about 10 years of age and thereafter survive in the canopy for approximately 20 years. Mean further life expectancy, 10.25 years, is greatest as the tree approaches the canopy. High mortality occurs between the production of seed and the establishment of seedlings (fig. 2). Rooting Habit- The root system of yagrumo hembra tends to be superficial, and therefore the tree is easily uprooted, particularly when immature. Prop or stilt roots are a prominent feature and are often as much as 1.0 m (3.3 ft) in height. Reaction to Competition- Yagrumo hembra is most accurately classed as intolerant of shade. This is especially true during the seedling and sapling stages. Competition for light and space during these stages may be the principal factor influencing growth and survival. Damaging Agents- In the seedling and sapling stages a major cause of mortality is defoliation by the larvae of the following: Prepodes spp., Gynaecia dirce, Historis odious, Correbidia terminalis, and Sylepta salicalis (22). The cotton or melon aphid (Aphis gossypii) is also commonly observed on leaves of yagrumo hembra. The above species often cause heavy damage to the leaves of mature trees. Strangulation by vines, including those of the families Leguminosae, Convolvulaceae, and Malpighiaceae (27), as well as many species of Philodendron, is also a major cause of mortality, particularly during the sapling stage. Mortality of mature trees may be caused by storm damage to the easily broken branches, by advancing age, or by environmental changes, such as shading and root competition, caused by the reestablishment of the climax forest.",Life History,"Yagrumo Hembra, Trumpet-Tree",cecropia,peltata,hardwood,10,0
"As a dominant secondary species, yagrumo hembra is invaluable in regeneration of the forest following disturbance. As it rapidly forms a dense stand, nutrients may be conserved and the environment beneath ameliorated sufficiently to allow species characteristic of a later stage of succession to germinate and grow. In this manner the soil may be stabilized following a disturbance such as a landslide. Its broad canopy protects the soil from excessive erosion and reestablishes shade conditions to the forest floor. With a specific gravity of 0.29, the wood of yagrumo hembra is only slightly heavier than local balsa. The wood is used in the finish of ""puertorrican cuatros,"" a local guitarlike musical instrument. Principal uses for wood in Puerto Rico once included excelsior. The wood also was shredded and mixed with cement to form a building or insulation board (4). Elsewhere, yagrumo hembra is used to produce paper pulp. Fiber yield per cord of fresh material is low, but it cooks rapidly, giving unbleached pulps that approach the best northern deciduous neutral sulfite pulps, e.g., aspen, in quality. A yield of 56 kg (123.5 lb) of pulp per 100 kg (220.5 lb) of wood has been estimated (17). The wood may be substituted for use in products made from heavier grades of balsa. It is also used for boxes, crates, and matchsticks (19). The hollow branches are often split and used for gutters or troughs, and entire branches are used for pipe floats, life preservers, and tamborines. Various substances have been extracted from yagrumo hembra for medicinal use (19), including one that increases cardiac muscular contraction and acts upon the kidneys as a diuretic. A substance extracted from the roots is said to heal wounds, and the leaves are often used as a poultice to reduce swelling and as an abrasive (27).",Special Uses,"Yagrumo Hembra, Trumpet-Tree",cecropia,peltata,hardwood,16,0
"Throughout its range yagrumo macho is a common species in secondary forests, in natural or man-made openings in mature forests, or along roadsides and river banks. In Puerto Rico's Subtropical Wet Forest it is often associated with yagrumo hembra or trumpet-tree (Cecropia peltata) and guano or balsa (Ochroma pyramidale), which are also fast-growing, large-leafed successional species having similar physiognomies (10). In openings caused by blowdowns it is also associated with tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), the mature component in natural remnants of the Subtropical Wet Forest in Puerto Rico. In the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, yagrumo macho grows with other thicket species like pegoge (Tabernaemontana arborea), mata-raton (Gliricidia sepium), Vernonia patens, Acacia globulifera, camasey (Miconia spp.), Belotia cambellii, and cerezo (Cordia glabra) (32). Three locally important and associated hardwood species in Trinidad are gommier (Protea insigne), Sterculia caribaea, and serette (Byrsonima spicata) (2). In Venezuela yagrumo macho and yagrumo hembra form a transition zone between guaba (Inga spp.) stands growing along the rivers and high forest stands of Parkia pendula occurring further inland (34). In the Bajo Atrato region of Colombia it is associated with Simarouba spp., boxwood (Jacaranda copaia), and Schizolobium parahybum (20,22).",Associated Forest Cover,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,1,0
"In Puerto Rico yagrumo macho grows in Subtropical Moist, Subtropical Wet, and Subtropical Rain Forest life zones (10). Mean annual temperatures in these life zones range from 24° to 26° C (75° to 79° F), 22° to 24° C (72° to 75° F), and 22° to 23° C (72° to 73° F) with mean annual precipitation of roughly 1500, 3000, and 4000 mm (60, 120, and 160 in), respectively. Elsewhere, yagrumo macho grows in similar life zones, and mean annual precipitation may exceed 5000 mm (200 in) in some parts of the range, as in Colombia (28).",Climate,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,2,0
"Existing literature shows no references to genetic or tree breeding research for yagrumo macho. Wide natural variation in genetic traits would be expected for yagrumo macho because of its extensive natural range and the fact that it grows in several life zones under varied environmental conditions. Since there are also several other species within the same genus throughout Latin America, undescribed hybrids may exist or might be possible if species were brought together under controlled laboratory or field conditions.",Genetics,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,7,0
"Yagrumo macho is the most widely distributed species within the genus Didymopanax. The range is extensive, roughly from latitude 17° N. to 25° S., and covers wet and moist forests of the West Indies, from Cuba to Trinidad, and continental tropical America from the States of Oaxaca and Veracruz in Mexico, through Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Brazil, and Argentina (4,12,15,23,25,26,33). The species was introduced to Jamaica and has been planted in southern Florida. In Puerto Rico it is quite common, growing in over half of the municipalities and in 8 of 13 State Forests, but it is not common anywhere else in its range. In Panama it is reportedly more abundant on the Pacific side than on the Atlantic side. Local or regional range maps are known only for Colombia and Puerto Rico (13,16,28).",Native Range,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,11,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Yagrumo macho has perfect flowers and reproduces in a yearly cycle. Of 96 trees observed for 14 months between 1976 and 1977 in the Luquillo Mountains and at the Rio Piedras Agricultural Experiment Station in Puerto Rico, 58 flowered mainly from October through December (21). There was significantly less flowering in other months. Minimum sizes of trees producing fruits were 6.4 in (21 ft) tall and 10.2 cm. (4 in) in d.b.h. In Trinidad, flowers have been observed mainly in October but also in April and September (19). information on flowering in other countries is not available, but with yagrumo macho's rather extended range, great latitudinal variation in flowering and fruiting can be expected. Flowers are numerous and grouped at ends of branches into many rounded clusters, from 0.3 to 0.6 in (1 to 2 ft) long. The 5petaled, fine brownish and gray hairy flowers are about 5.0 min (0.2 in) across, with white petals about 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long, and five stamens and two styles (16,21). Pollination mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Bees of the Rigona and Mellipona genera have been observed on yagrumo macho flowers in Costa Rica. Ants of the Crematogaster genus may also play a role. It takes approximately I to 2 months for flowers to develop into fruits. Immature fruits are dark green or deep purple. They are fleshy, 4 to 6 min (0. 16 to 0,24 in) long, 7 to 10 min (0.28 to 0.39 in) wide, and about 2 min (0.08 in) thick. Fruits usually contain two and occasionally three oblong and flattened brown seeds, about 5 min (0.2 in) long. Mature fruits are dropped almost every month in Puerto Rico, but production peaks from November through June (21). In Costa Rica fruits mature in January and fall from February through May Seed Production and Dissemination- Seed production for yagrumo macho is an almost continuous process, as it is for other successional species. Seeds have a hard, impermeable outer coat; they can thus remain on the ground for a long time and still retain viability to germinate when openings in the canopy occur. When seed is collected and taken away from field conditions, the number of viable seeds is quite small and germination is extremely poor. Of over 800 individual seeds collected at one site in Puerto Rico, only 5 were viable (21). Highest germination percentages recorded were 30 percent after 70 days in Brazil and 35 percent after 40 to 90 days in Costa Rica. In Brazil the seeds were soaked for 9 to 10 hours in an unspecified chemical, covered with a thin layer of soil, and protected from direct sunlight. Seeds in Costa Rica were treated with a 3 percent solution of sodium hypochlorite (21). After germination periods of 52 to 120 days, only 12 of 300 seeds germinated in three trials in Puerto Rico. Several soaking treatments with 9 N sulfuric acid were used. Old records from Trinidad show that treating with unknown plant hormone solutions and human urine aided seed germination. Some 16 bird species feed on yagrumo macho seed or fruits in Puerto Rico. This may provide a plausible reason why good germination in the field cannot be duplicated in laboratory or nursery conditions. Studies have shown that after seeds are ingested by birds, they are subjected to scarification in the gizzard and chemical treatment by gastric juices in the stomach (20). Although attempts to germinate seeds taken from bird feces have failed in Puerto Rico, they have been successful in Costa Rica. It is also proposed that some species feed only on the outer coat of yagrumo macho seed and others feed on the seed endosperm. Thus dormancy could be broken by mechanical puncturing or breaking of the seed coat. Until further evidence is gathered, it can be assumed that birds play the primary role in germination and dissemination of yagrumo macho seed. In Trinidad, bats also act as dispersal agents (3). Yagrumo macho seed is unwinged and heavy. Of 341 fruits and 125 individual seeds collected beneath one tree in Puerto Rico, all came from one quadrant around the tree's base. Seedling Development- Germi nation is epigeous. Few studies document seedling growth of yagrumo macho in either field or nursery conditions. Early growth is fairly rapid and best when seedlings are exposed to direct sunlight. In Brazil, d.b.h. and height mean annual increments (MAI's) were 3.0 cm (1.2 in) and 1.7 in (5.6 ft) for 2-year-old plantations (5). A 7-year-old plantation had mean annual height and d.b.h. increments of 1.7 in (5.6 ft) and 19 min (0.8 in). A 20-month-old plantation in Bajo Atrato region of Colombia, planted at 3- by 3-m (9.8- by 9.8-ft) spacing, had very good form and fine branching, with a branch angle usually greater than 70°. Height and d.b.h. averaged 8 in (26 ft) and 12 cm (4.7 in) (2 0). An MAI of 5.6 mm (0.22 in) in diameter was recorded in Puerto Rico for 20 individuals, where the initial overbark d.b.h. was mostly between 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) (table 1). Growth was somewhat irregular when related to size class, perhaps because of crown position and the fact that some trees were exposed to direct sunlight and others were not. Mortality for the 20 individuals was 5 percent in I year and was attributed to vine overgrowth (21). Vegetative Reproduction- Yagrumo macho wildings transplant readily and the species apparently reproduces by coppicing (19,22). In Puerto Rico sprouting was seen from stems broken off by wind but not on stems killed by lightning (21). Cuttings were used in Brazil (5).",Reproduction and Early Growth,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- Mature yagrumo macho may reach a height of 30 m (100 ft) and a d.b.h. up to 36 cm (14 in) (6,29). More commonly, as in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico (17), the tree is of medium height and diameter, 15 to 17 m (49 to 56 ft) and 20 to 22 cm (8 to 9 in). The bole is cylindrical, swollen at the base, and has a ringed appearance. Natural pruning in the lower half is excellent (fig. 1). Yagrumo macho cannot be included in biomass estimations from regression equations because of its unusual umbrella-like crown (8). The outer bark is smooth and gray and the inner bark has a slightly bitter or spicy taste (16). Maximum age is probably between 35 and 50 years (21). Rooting is reportedly superficial. Growth or yield data for mature trees are scarce since yagrumo macho is harvested for local markets and is seldom grown under intensive plantation conditions. Limited data on diameter growth are available for older stands in Puerto Rico. Ten-year d.b.h. measurements in mature tabonuco forests in the Luquillo Mountains showed an MAI from 1.5 to 4.6 mm (0.06 to 0.18 in) (30). Observed growth differences appeared to be related to crown position, with suppressed trees growing least. Eighteen-year d.b.h. measurements showed MAI rates from 3.3 to 5.3 mm (0.13 to 0.21 in) on three sites (table 2) (9). The highest rate was found at Sabana 4, where yagrumo macho is a component of mature tabonuco forests. When analyzed across all three sites, growth differences between crown classes were not positively correlated with increasing crown dominance. Measurements in the Toro Negro State Forest from 1951 to 1976 showed MAI growth for yagrumo macho at 5 mm (0.2 in) (31). Mean annual d.b.h. growth rates observed in Puerto Rico do not even approach the 10 mm (0.39 in) figure sometimes quoted for mature rain forest tree species in the tropics. They are also surprisingly slow for a reportedly fast-growing successional species. Yet caution should be used in interpreting these data because of the long measurement intervals used that could cancel initial fast growth spurts occurring after successful regeneration was established (table 1). Data from Puerto Rico for yagrumo macho and yagrumo hembra, also a successional species, show that periodic diameter growth for codominant, intermediate, and suppressed trees is comparable. This suggests that a dominant position is required before good diameter growth is shown. Finally, although periodic d.b.h. growth of older yagrumo macho in Puerto Rico was not related to initial diameter classes, it was statistically lower at lower elevations, where it was 1.9 mm (0.07 in) per year, than at higher elevations, where it was 3.7 mm (0.15 in) per year (9). Rooting Habit- No information available. Reaction to Competition- Yagrumo macho is classed as intolerant of shade. When planted in full sunlight it exhibits its best growth and reproduction and may be very aggressive against other species. Over a 2- to 6-year d.b.h. measurement period in tabonuco forests in Puerto Rico (1), MAI of yagrumo macho was 3.3 mm (0.13 in). Two more tolerant species found in the same locality, palo de matos (Ormosia krugii) and ausubo (Manilkara bidentata), averaged 5.1 and 6.6 mm (0.20 and 0.26 in). Other work in Puerto Rico indicates that many species growing in association with yagrumo macho have larger periodic diameter increments, probably because they are more tolerant of shade (31). Few special silvicultural systems for yagrumo macho are found in existing literature. Some 30 years ago in Trinidad, a policy of ""let nature heal herself' was followed when reforesting degraded or poor sites (3). Yagrumo macho was one of 18 timber species whose natural regeneration was allowed to grow under a high shelterwood system (2). In Brazil there are pure yagrumo macho plantations designed to produce wood for match splints (5,27). Because yagrumo macho rapidly colonizes open areas and is intolerant, some sort of selective clearcutting is needed to promote adequate regeneration by natural seeding. After cutting, yagrumo macho is one of the first species to become established. It should then be one of the first to be cut for commercial use, selectively leaving more valuable species to be harvested later in the established rotation cycle. Damaging Agents- Several agents cause damage or death to saplings or mature trees. The most common is probably wind, which can break off branches or uproot entire trees. Wind damage is most acute on very wet, steep sites where saturated unstable soils cannot provide adequate anchorage for roots. In the Luquillo Mountains, climbers or stranglers like Clusia griesebachiana and morning glory (Ipomoea spp.) are common to wetter sites and have caused branch breakage or death of larger seedlings or saplings. Yagrumo macho is apparently free from serious diseases in nursery and field conditions, but several insects (Scarabaidae and Pyraustidae) consume either foliage or woody tree material in Puerto Rico. Young trees are sometimes killed by grazing cattle in rural areas. Clearing land for agricultural or other development often causes widespread mortality.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,14,0
"Yagrumo macho is not exacting in soil requirements. Therefore, it grows well on a variety of soils, especially those that have been abandoned after agricultural use. In Trinidad, stands are found on flat areas having deep, bleached sands (Entisols) and on gently undulating areas having outcrops of acidic clays (Ultisols or Inceptisols) (2,19). In Puerto Rico the species grows most commonly on either deep or shallow acid clays (Ultisols and Inceptisols) in the mountains or on calcareous soils (Mollisols) in the ""haystack"" (mogote) limestone hills. Although yagrumo macho grows on flat areas in Puerto Rico, particularly near streams, it is more predominant in upland dissected terrain (17) from 100 to 900 m (330 to 2,950 ft); slopes are usually 45 percent or more. On the western end of Puerto Rico, it grows almost at sea level (21). The highest elevations reported for yagrumo macho are in Colombia, where it can be found from 500 to 1700 m (1,640 to 5,580 ft) (28).",Soils and Topography,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,15,0
"Yagrumo macho's specific gravity is between 0.35 and 0.60. Mechanical and physical properties of the wood are somewhat higher than those of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) (6,14). Yagrumo macho is used for general carpentry and interior construction (18). It is also suited for crates and boxes, utility plywood or core stock, match splints, even particleboard, and could probably be substituted for heavier grades of balsa (16). Felled timber is very susceptible to decay and fungal attack if not converted almost immediately. Penetration and absorption of treating solutions, either in open or pressurized tanks, is fair but can be improved considerably by incising untreated material first. Nonincised posts, cold-soaked for 5 days in a 10-percent solution of pentachlorophenol dissolved in diesel fuel, lasted from 9 to 26 years in graveyard tests in Puerto Rico. Double diffusion treatment with several chemicals gave similar results, but cold-soaking with only a 5-percent solution of pentachlorophenol dissolved in diesel fuel was far inferior, the life expectancy being only about 3 years (7). Yagrumo macho leaves are used for home remedies in some countries (16). Special uses of the wood in Guyana include drums and canoes (11). Brazil has tested yagrumo macho suitability for ethanol production along with 24 other tree species (24). Yield was 299 liters (79 gal) per ton of raw material, close to the maximum yield of 315 liters (83 gal) per ton registered for Protium spp.",Special Uses,Yagrumo Macho,didymopanax,morototoni,hardwood,16,0

On bottom lands and on the better drained soils of the Coastal Plain, yellow-poplar grows in mixture with the tupelos (Nyssa spp.), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), oaks Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). In the Piedmont, associated species include oaks, sweetgum, blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), red maple, loblolly pine, shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), Virginia pine (P virginiana), hickories (Carya spp.), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), and redcedar (Juniperus virginiana). At lower elevations in the Appalachian Mountains, yellow-poplar is found with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), white pine (Pinus strobus), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), hickories, white oak (Quercus alba), other oaks, black walnut (Juglans nigra), yellow pines, flowering dogwood, sourwood, sweet birch (Betula lenta), blackgum, basswood (Tilia americana), and Carolina silverbell (Halesia carolina). At higher elevations, associated species include northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), cucumber tree (Magnolia acuminata), yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). Trees associated with yellow-poplar in nonmountainous areas of the North and Midwest include white oak, black oak Quercus velutina), northern red oak, ash, beech, sugar maple, blackgum, dogwood, and hickories. Pure stands of yellow-poplar occupy only a small percentage of the total land within the range of the species, but they are usually on productive sites that include some of the most valuable timber-producing forests in eastern North America. It has been repeatedly observed in the southern Appalachians that the percentage of yellow-poplar increases noticeably with increasing quality of the site. Where yellow-poplar grows in pure, or nearly pure, stands on medium and lower quality sites, it probably originated on abandoned old fields.",Associated Forest Cover,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,1,0
"Because of its wide geographic distribution, yellow-poplar grows under a variety of climatic conditions. Low temperature extremes vary from severe winters in southern New England and upper New York with a mean January temperature of -7.2° C (19° F) to almost frost-free winters in central Florida with a mean January temperature of 16.1° C (61° F). Average July temperature varies from 20.6° C (69° F) in the northern part of the range to 27.2° C (81° F) in the southern. Rainfall in the range of yellow-poplar varies from 760 mm (30 in) to more than 2030 mm (80 in) in some areas of the southern Appalachians. Average number of frost-free days varies from 150 to more than 310 days within the north-to-south range of yellow-poplar. Effects of temperature and moisture extremes are tempered somewhat by local topography. At the northern end of its range, yellow-poplar is usually found in valleys and stream bottoms at elevations below 300 m (1,000 ft). In the southern Appalachians, it may grow on a variety of sites, including stream bottoms, coves, and moist slopes up to an elevation of about 1370 m (4,500 ft). Toward the southern limit of the range, where high temperatures and soil moisture probably become limiting, the species usually is confined to moist, but well-drained, stream bottoms. Optimum development of yellow-poplar occurs where rainfall is well distributed over a long growing season.",Climate,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,2,0
"At least one distinct ecotype of yellow-poplar has been confirmed. First evidence came from a plantation near Charleston, SC, where trees from a Coastal Plain source in eastern North Carolina were twice as tall 3 years after outplanting as those from a mountain source in western North Carolina (29). Later, a source from the Coastal Plain of North Carolina performed poorly in comparison to upland sources when planted at a Piedmont location but was far superior to upland sources when planted on organic soils of the Coastal Plain where pH values seldom exceed 4.0 (19). Yellow-poplar of the coastal source has a distinctive leaf pattern and color-rounded lobes and copperish-red leaves. It is apparently adapted to the highly acidic, water-saturated organic soils of the Coastal Plain and is able to withstand periodic inundation without harm (32). Sources with the distinctive leaf characteristics have been found as far south as Florida.",Hybrids,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,9,0
"Yellow-poplar grows throughout the Eastern United States from southern New England, west through southern Ontario and Michigan, south to Louisiana, then east to north-central Florida (22). It is most abundant and reaches its largest size in the valley of the Ohio River and on the mountain slopes of North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Appalachian Mountains and adjacent Piedmont running south from Pennsylvania to Georgia contained 75 percent of all yellow-poplar growing stock in 1974. -The native range of yellow-poplar.",Native Range,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,11,0
"The significant variation in many traits among individual trees, among stands, and between geographic sources of yellow-poplar (15,29,34) is of interest to forest managers and users of wood products. Varying degrees of genetic control have been demonstrated for wood and tree properties such as specific gravity and fiber length; straightness; branch angle; natural pruning ability; leaf, fruit, and seed characteristics; disease resistance; growth of seedlings; and length of growing season. For other important traits, such as the tendency to produce epicormic sprouts, evidence exists that the trait is strongly inherited although this has not yet been demonstrated conclusively. A growth chamber study revealed that seedlings of northern and southern origin responded very differently to day-length treatments (43). A day length of 18 hours inhibited the northern source but not the southern. The most consistent difference among geographic seed sources has appeared in dormancy relationships. In general, the more northern sources start growth later and cease earlier than the more southern sources. Few studies are old enough to permit good comparisons of volume differences for different seed sources, but significant differences in early height growth have been reported. While most geographic differences are associated with latitude of source, there are good indications that environmental differences associated with altitude are also important. In North Carolina, a clinal pattern of variation existed from coast to mountain for a number of seed and leaf characteristics (19).",Population Differences,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,12,0
"Flowering and Fruiting- Yellow-poplar has a singly occurring, perfect flower 4 to 5 cm wide (1.5 to 2 in), with six petals varying in color from a light yellowish green at the margin to a deep orange band at the center. Yellow-poplars usually produce their first flowers at 15 to 20 years of age and may continue production for 200 years (29,31). Flowering occurs from April to June depending on location and weather conditions. The flowering period for each tree varies from 2 to 6 weeks depending on the size and age of the tree and number of flowers per tree. Pollination must occur soon after the flowers open while the stigmas are light colored and succulent; brown stigmas are no longer receptive to pollen. Normally the receptive period is only 12 to 24 daylight hours. Insects are important pollinators; flies, beetles, honey bees, and bumble bees (in decreasing order of abundance) were observed on opened flowers. However, uncontrolled insect pollinations do not result in effective pollination of all stigmas, and a great deal of selfing occurs (7). Higher percentages of filled seed result from cross-pollination and crosses among widely separated trees (37). By controlled cross-pollination, as many as 90-percent filled seed per cone was obtained; the highest percentage for an open-pollinated tree was 35 percent. Cross-pollinated seedlings tended to be more vigorous than seedlings obtained from open pollination. Seed Production and Dissemination- The conelike aggregate of many winged carpels ripens and matures from early August in the North to late October in the South. In the Piedmont of North Carolina, seedfall begins in mid-October and reaches its peak early in November. High seedfall occurs during dry periods with high temperatures, while periods of heavy rainfall result in low seed dissemination rates. Viable seed is disseminated from mid-October to mid-March; the percentage of viability, which ranges from 5 to 20 percent, is about equal throughout the period. Yellow-poplar is a prolific seeder, and large crops are produced almost annually (29,31). In North Carolina, a 25-cm (10-in) tree produced 750 cones with 7,500 sound seeds, and a 51-cm (20-in) tree produced 3,250 cones with 29,000 sound seeds. A seedfall of 741,000 to 1,482,000/ha (300,000 to 600,000/acre) is not uncommon. Measurement of the 1966 seed crop in 19 southern Appalachian stands showed an average of 3.7 million seeds per hectare (1.5 million/acre). Seed size is highly variable, the number per kilogram ranging from 11,000 to 40,000 (5,000 to 18,000/lb). In general, southern seeds are larger than northern ones. The individual, winged samaras may be scattered by the wind to distances equal to four or five times the height of a tree. In southern Indiana, a seedfall pattern was shown to be oval, with the center north of the seed tree. Prevailing south and southwest winds occasionally carried seeds more than 183 m (600 ft). Distribution of filled seeds occurred in satisfactory numbers-2,470 to 24,700/ha (1,000 to 10,000/acre)-as far as 60 rn (200 ft) from a good seed tree in the direction of the prevailing wind and 30 m (100 ft) in all other directions. Yellow-poplar seeds retain their viability in the forest floor from 4 to 7 years (11). Large quantities of seeds in the forest floor are capable of producing seedlings when suitable environmental conditions exist. In West Virginia, a study in three 40-year-old stands with 101 to 470 yellow-poplar trees per hectare (41 to 190/acre) showed from 240,000 to 475,000 sound seeds per hectare (97,000 to 192,000/acre) in the forest floor (17). These seeds produced between 138,000 to 190,000 seedlings per hectare (56,000 to 77,000/acre) when transferred to an open area and kept well watered. Seedling Development- Yellow-poplar seeds must overwinter under natural conditions, or be stratified under controlled conditions, to overcome dormancy. Under controlled conditions, stratification in moist sand within a temperature range of 0° to 10° C (32° to 50° F) for periods of 70 to 90 days resulted in satisfactory germination. However, seedling yield increases with increasing time of stratification. Germination is epigeal. Germinating yellow-poplar seedlings need a suitable seedbed and adequate moisture to survive and become established. Seed germination and seedling development is better on mineral soils or well-decomposed organic matter than on a thick, undecomposed litter layer. Scarification and fires, which put seeds in contact with mineral soil, increases the number of seedlings established significantly (10,33). Under normal conditions, however, the site disturbance caused by logging the mature stand is the only seedbed preparation needed to provide enough yellow-poplar seedlings for a new stand. In Indiana, I year after cutting, there were 9,900 yellow-poplar seedlings per hectare (4,000/acre) on a plot that was clearcut, and 12,000/ha (4,800/acre) on partially cut plots. In western North Carolina, more than 124,000 seedlings/ha (50,000/acre) followed both clearcuts and partial cuts that removed as little as one-third the basal area (26). On occasional sites, deep accumulations of litter may require some seedbed treatment, particularly on the drier sites dominated by oaks or beech, and both disking and burning have proven effective. These treatments have also been recommended for sites with few seeds in the forest floor, especially if the site is covered with dense herbaceous growth. Yellow-poplar seedlings reach maximum or near-maximum photosynthetic efficiency at relatively low light intensities, as low as 3 to 10 percent of full sunlight (29,31). Growth was poor, however, under an overstory canopy where the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor was limited to 1.33 percent; where herbaceous cover existed, it was only 0. 13 percent. Sufficient sunlight can be admitted by various cutting practices. Harvest cuts ranging from removal of 30 percent of basal area to complete clearcuts have resulted in establishment and growth of large numbers of seedlings. Clearcutting, seed-tree cutting, and shelterwood cutting have all been used successfully to regenerate yellow-poplar (26,28,38,45). However, when partial cuts such as shelterwood are used, height growth is severely limited by the overstory. Seedlings in clearcuts may be two to three times taller than seedlings under a shelterwood after the first 5 to 10 years. The minimum size opening that can be used to regenerate yellow-poplar is fairly small (10). Numbers of seedlings per hectare vary little in openings of 0.12 to 12.36 ha (0.05 to 5 acres). Opening size, however, does affect growth significantly. Both diameter and height are retarded in openings smaller than 1.24 to 2.47 ha (0.5 to 1 acre). Season of logging, though not of critical importance, does have some effect on establishment and growth of yellow-poplar seedlings (40). In West Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana, summer logging produced fewer seedlings than logging at other times of the year. Apparently, in summer-logged stands most of the seeds did not germinate until the following year, and these small seedlings were not as well able to compete with the rank vegetation that started the previous year. Nevertheless, cuttings in summer months usually have produced sufficient seedlings where a good seed source previously was present. If seed supply is expected to be scarce, logging in fall, winter, or early spring might be advisable. After germination, several critical years follow. During this period sufficient soil moisture must be available, good drainage and protection against drying and frost heaving are necessary, and there must be no severe competition from nearby sprout growth. In a study in which various mulches were used to induce soil temperature variation, seedlings grew faster in warm soil than in cool soil. Soil temperatures as high as 36.1° C (97° F) had a beneficial effect on seedling growth. Yellow-poplar seedlings normally survive dormant-season flooding, but it was found that 1-year-old seedlings were usually killed by 4 days or more of flooding during the growing season (23). This vulnerability during the growing season explains why yellow-poplar does not grow on flood plains of rivers that flood periodically for several days at a time. After the first growing season, vegetative competition may become the most important factor affecting survival and growth. Reducing competition by cutting, burning, disking, or by using herbicides may be needed to assure success. On favorable sites the success of regeneration can usually be determined by the size and vigor of the seedlings at the end of the third year. Height growth during the first year ranges from a few centimeters to more than 0.3 m (1 ft) on the best sites. With full light, rapid height growth begins the second year, and at the end of 5 years trees may be 3 to 5.5 in (10 to 18 ft) tall. During its seedling and sapling stages, yellow-poplar is capable of making extremely rapid growth. An 11-year-old natural seedling 15.2 m (50 ft) tall has been recorded. The behavior and duration of height growth of yellow-poplar vary by latitude. In a Pennsylvania study, seedlings had a 95-day height-growth period beginning late in April and ending about August 1. A sharp peak in height growth was reached about June 1. In a northwestern Connecticut study, yellow-poplar had a 110-day height-growth period beginning in late April and ending in mid-August. Ninety percent of this growth took place in a 60-day period from May 20 to July 20, and a sharp peak in height growth was noted in the middle of June. In a study conducted in the lower Piedmont of North Carolina, yellow-poplar had a 160-day height-growth period beginning in early April and ending about the middle of September. Growth was fairly constant, and there was no peak in growth rate during the growing season. Vegetative Reproduction- Yellow-poplar sprouts arise chiefly from preexisting dormant buds situated near the base of dead or dying stems, or near the soil line on stumps. Sprouts may occur as high as 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in) on high stumps, but more than 80 percent arise at or below the soil line (44). The percentage of stumps sprouting and the number of sprouts per stump decrease with increasing stump size. Stumps as large as 66 to 76 cm (26 to 30 in) sprouted 40 percent of the time, however, with an average of eight sprouts per stump. Yellow-poplar of the age and size harvested in second-growth stands sprouts prolifically. Trees of sprout origin are more subject to butt rot than those of seedling origin (42). Nevertheless, a high percentage of stumps that sprout produce at least one stem that is well anchored, vigorous, and of desirable quality for crop-tree development (20). In this respect, position on stump is important to subsequent development. Sprouts arising from roots or from the stump below groundline usually lack a heartwood connection with the stump heartwood because the roots and below-ground portions of the stump do not normally contain heartwood. Sapwood tissues separating heartwood columns of stumps and sprouts may prevent heart rot fungi, which enters the stump heartwood, from spreading to the heartwood of the sprout. The initial growth rate of yellow-poplar sprouts far exceeds that of young seedlings. In western North Carolina, the dominant sprout on each of 60 stumps on a good site grew an average of 1.4 m (4.7 ft) per year over the first 6 years (2). At age 24, these sprouts averaged 24.4 in (80 ft) in height and 24 cm (9.6 in) d.b.h. In West Virginia, the dominant stem of each sprout clump grew at the rate of 0.9 in (2.9 ft) per year for 11 years on a medium-quality site for yellow-poplar (44). The rapid, early growth rate begins to drop off rnarkedly somewhere between 20 and 30 years. At this time, seedlings of similar age may catch up and exceed sprouts in rate of height growth. A number of investigators have attempted to root yellow-poplar cuttings, but most early attempts were not successful. In a more recent study, cuttings were rooted successfully after they were dipped in dolebutyric acid and a mist of water was sprayed over the propagation bed (6). It is not known, however, whether these rooted cuttings would have successfully survived outplanting. Yellow-poplar has been successfully rooted from stump sprouts of 7-year-old trees; soft-tissue cuttings placed in a mist bed began rooting in 4 weeks and successfully survived transplanting. A system of splitting seedlings longitudinally and then propagating the halves was also highly successful. However, splitting seedlings provides only one additional new plant from the ortet, while rooting stump sprouts provides several. A technique for propagating yellow-poplar by making use of its epicormic branching ability has recently been described (24). Partial girdling into the outer one or two annual rings results in a profusion of epicormic sprouts that can then be rooted in the same way as stump sprouts. This method has the advantage of preserving the selected ortet for repeated use. Experience with this method, however, reveals that not every girdled tree will sprout well. Young trees and trees with low vigor are better sprouters than old trees and rapidly growing trees.",Reproduction and Early Growth,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,13,0
"Growth and Yield- The mature yellow-poplar has a striking appearance. In forest stands its trunk is very straight, tall, and clear of lateral branches for a considerable height. It is among the tallest of all Eastern United States broadleaf trees. On the best sites, old-growth trees may be nearly 61 in (200 ft) high and 2.4 to 3.7 in (8 to 12 ft) d.b.h., but more often they are from 30.5 to 45.7 in (100 to 150 ft) at maturity, with a straight trunk 0.6 to 1.5 m (2 to 5 ft) in diameter. Age at natural death is usually about 200 to 250 years. However, some trees may live up to 300 years. Height and d.b.h. expected of the 25 largest trees per acre in unthinned second-growth southern Appalachian stands are shown in table 1. These data represent an average dominant tree grown under fully stocked stand conditions. The largest trees would be 7.6 to 12.7 cm (3 to 5 in) larger than the average dominant at comparable ages. Table 2 shows selected empirical yields for natural stands (3,27). Mean annual increment in total cubic volume ranges from 5.2 to 11.6 m³/ha (75 to 165 ft³ /acre), depending on site, at culmination around 70 years of age. Rooting Habit- Yellow-poplar has a rapidly growing and deeply penetrating juvenile taproot, as well as many strongly developed and wide-spreading lateral roots. It is considered to have a ""flexible"" rooting habit, even in the juvenile stage. Reaction to Competition- Although classed as intolerant of shade, yellow-poplar can overcome much competition because it produces numerous seedlings and sprouts, and grows very rapidly. On land of site index 23 m (75 ft) and higher in the southern Appalachians, yellow-poplar has faster height growth than any of its associates except white pine up to 50 years of age (29). If not overtopped, yellow-poplar takes and holds its place in the dominant crown canopy of the developing stand. It is often a pioneer on abandoned old fields or clearcut land and may form essentially pure stands on very good sites. More often it regenerates as a mixed type with other species, and it commonly persists in old-growth stands as scattered individuals. Yellow-poplar expresses dominance well and seldom, if ever, stagnates because of excessive stand density. It prunes very well in closed stands. Although it produces epicormic sprouts when the bole is exposed, this trait is less pronounced than in many other hardwood species. Because of these growth characteristics, yellow-poplar stands can develop and produce considerable quantities of large, high-quality products with no intermediate stand management. In the seedling-sapling stage, dominant and codominant trees are little affected by thinning or cleaning (21,39). Intermediate or overtopped trees of good vigor respond to release in both diameter and height growth (46). Cultural treatment of seedling-sapling stands is seldom needed or justified, however, except to remove vines (12). By the time stands reach pole size at 20 to 30 years of age, the peak rates of growth and mortality are past and the crown canopy is closed. Crown size on surviving trees is reduced and diameter growth is considerably slowed. Thinnings that salvage or prevent mortality, increase the growth of residual trees, shorten rotations, and increase the yield of high-value timber products are the essence of intermediate stand management. The net result of numerous thinning experiments is that individual yellow-poplar trees tend to use the space and accelerate diameter increment (4,5,9,29). Response occurs across a wide range of sites and stand ages, even in stands as old as 80 years that have never been thinned previously. Total cubic-volume growth is greatest at the highest densities and would be maximized by very light, frequent thinnings that prevent or salvage mortality. On the other hand, board-foot volume growth is maximum at densities well below those that maximize cubic-foot volume growth. Board-foot growth is near maximum over a wide range of density. Thus, there is considerable leeway to manipulate stocking levels to achieve diameter growth and quality goals without sacrificing volume growth of the high-value products. Damaging Agents- Yellow-poplar is unusually free from damage by pests compared with many other commercially important species. While more than 30 species of insects attack yellow-poplar, only 4 species are considered to have significant economic impact (8). The tuliptree scale (Toumeyella liriodendri) causes loss of vigor by removing large quantities of phloem sap. Scale attacks often kill leaders of seedlings and saplings causing them to be overtopped by competitors. The yellow-poplar weevil (Odontopus calceatus) feeds on buds and foliage and may occur in outbreaks over large areas. The rootcollar borer (Euzophera ostricolorella) attacks the phloem tissue at the base of the tree and provides entry points for rots and other pathogens. Attacks by the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus) do not kill the tree but may degrade the wood. The defect consists of black-stained burrows and discolored wood called ""calico poplar."" Fire scars, logging damage, animal and bird damage, top breakage, dying limbs, and decaying parent stumps all provide entry for decay-causing fungi (16). Probably the most common type of decay associated with basal wounding and decaying stumps is a soft, spongy, white or gray rot caused by the fungus Armillaria mellea. A white heartwood rot caused by Collybia velutipes often is associated with top breakage and dying limbs. Species of the genus Nectria have been associated with stem cankers. Incidence of this disease and mortality from it was greatest on low-vigor trees. A canker caused by Fusarium solani was isolated from large yellow-poplars in Ohio and was shown to cause characteristic cankers through pathogenicity studies. Some mortality results during periods of drought, but F solani apparently is not a virulent pathogen and causes damage only when the host is weakened by unfavorable environmental factors. Dieback and associated stem canker of yellow-poplar saplings were reported to have resulted in considerable mortality in some stands. A fungus of the genus Myxosporium was associated with dead bark of infected trees and was shown to cause canker formation after experimental inoculations. Identical dieback symptoms were reported for scattered areas throughout the South. Symptoms included chlorosis of leaves, sparse crown, dieback, trunk and branch cankers, and epicormic sprouting. Several fungal species were consistently isolated from cankered trees, but there was uncertainty about the causative agent. The severity and extent of infection are greater in upland sites than in bottom-land sites. All canker-forming diseases reported for yellow-poplar appear to be confined to, or most severe on, trees that are low in vigor because of drought, poor site, or competition. A nursery root-rot disease caused by Cylindrocladium scoparium causes root and stem lesions. It is frequently lethal in nursery beds and causes low survival and poor growth when infected seedlings are outplanted. Extensive root damage and mortality in a 27-year-old yellow-poplar plantation have been reported. Yellow-poplar logs, especially when cut in warmer seasons, are subject to rapid deterioration because of attacks of wood-staining fungi that feed largely on the starch and sugars in the green sapwood and penetrate deeply while the wood is moist. The most common rapid-staining species is Ceratocystis pluriannulata. Yellow-poplar seedlings and saplings have thin bark and are extremely susceptible to fire damage. Even a light ground fire is usually fatal to small stems up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. These stems resprout after fire, but repeated fires may eliminate yellow-poplar from a site. When the bark becomes thick enough to insulate the cambium (about 1.3 cm; 0.5 in), yellow-poplar becomes extremely fire resistant. Sleet and glaze storms, which occur periodically within the range of yellow-poplar, may cause considerable damage. Stump sprouts are particularly susceptible to injury, slender trees may be broken off, and tops of dominant and codominant trees are often broken. Top damage is often the point of entry for fungi. Although yellow-poplar usually makes remarkable recovery after such storms, repeated damage can result in a growth reduction and loss of quality. The leaves, twigs, and branches of yellow-poplar are tender and palatable to livestock and white-tailed deer, and young trees are often heavily browsed. Seedlings are grazed to the ground, small saplings are trimmed back, and even large saplings may be ridden down and severely damaged. In areas where animals are concentrated, young yellow-poplar is frequently eliminated. Rabbits also eat the bark and buds of seedlings and saplings and can be quite destructive at times. When the sap is running in the spring, yellow-poplar is very susceptible to logging damage. If a falling tree strikes a standing poplar, there is often considerable bark loss up and down the bole of the standing tree. Even if the bark appears only lightly bruised, it may subsequently dry up and fall off in long strips. Frost, especially in frost pockets, can affect the early growth and development of yellow-poplar. Following a late spring frost in a 20-year-old plantation, it was found that leaf mortality varied from 5 to 100 percent of the leaves on the individual trees. Leaf mortality was lowest on trees with a high foliar content of potassium. Frost may also cause bole damage in the form of shake, a separation of growth rings resulting in cull. A weather-induced defect called blister shake, related to frost shake, was described in 30-year-old yellow-poplar trees in West Virginia. Vines can be extremely damaging to yellow-poplar. Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), kudzu (Pueraria lobata), and climbing bittersweet (Celastrus scandens) have been known to have deleterious effects on yellow-poplar in isolated cases. However, the most widespread damage throughout the Appalachians results from wild grapevines (Vitis spp.) (36,41), particularly on good sites that have been regenerated naturally by clearcutting. Many forest managers and researchers consider grape the most serious threat to production of high-quality yellow-poplar timber in the Appalachian region. Grapevines damage young trees by breaking limbs and tops, twisting and bending the main stem, and intercepting solar radiation. The result is reduced growth, malformation of stem and crown, and sometimes death of the trees. Grapevines also worsen winter storm damage in some areas by furnishing increased surface area for accumulation of ice and snow.",Sapling and Pole Stages to Maturity,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,14,0
"Yellow-poplar thrives on many soil types with various physical properties, chemical composition, and parent material. Within the major portion of the range of yellow-poplar, these soils fall in soil orders Inceptisols and Ultisols. Exceptionally good growth has been observed on alluvial soils bordering streams, on loam soils of mountain coves, on talus slopes below cliffs and bluffs, and on well-watered, gravelly soils. In general, where yellow-poplar grows naturally and well, the soils are moderately moist, well drained, and loose textured; it rarely does well in very wet or very dry situations. Studies in locations as varied as the Coastal Plain of New Jersey, the Central States, the Great Appalachian Valley, the Carolina and Virginia Piedmonts, the Cumberland Plateau, and the mountains of north Georgia have isolated soil features that measure effective rooting depth and moisture-supplying capacity as the most important determinants of growth (13, 18, 25, 30, 35). These variables have been expressed in quantitative terms such as relative content of sand, silt, and clay; depth of humus accumulation; organic matter content of different horizons of the soil profile; percent moisture retention; available water; and depth to impermeable layers. The same studies also stressed that topographic features plus latitude and elevation, which partially determine the amount of incoming solar radiation and rate of evaporation or otherwise influence the moisture supplying capacity of soil, are important variables in assessing site suitability for yellow-poplar growth. The best growth usually occurs on north and east aspects, on lower slopes, in sheltered coves, and on gentle, concave slopes. Low levels of soil nutrients-most frequently nitrogen-have occasionally been linked to slow rates of growth for yellow-poplar. Also, naturally occurring levels of phosphorous and potassium can limit growth. However, soil physical properties far overshadow chemical properties in determining distribution and growth of yellow-poplar.",Soils and Topography,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,15,0
"Yellow-poplar is an extremely versatile wood with a multitude of uses. Most important recent uses of the wood have been for lumber for unexposed furniture parts and core stock, rotary-cut veneer for use as crossbands in construction of furniture parts, in plywood for backs and interior parts, and as pulpwood. Considerable attention is being given to its use as structural framing material and for veneers in structural plywood as a substitute for increasingly scarce softwoods. Yellow-poplar, with its shiny green leaves, distinctive flower, and statuesque appearance, is an excellent ornamental for park and garden where there is adequate space to accommodate its large size. It has distinctive value as a honey tree (25). In one season a tree less than 20 years old reportedly yields 3.6 kg (8 lb) of nectar equal to 1.8 kg (4 lb) of honey. It has nominal value as a source of wildlife food in comparison to some other species, but its seeds are eaten by quails, purple finches, rabbits, gray squirrels, and white-footed mice. Because of its greater volume per acre, which is due to its greater density and height, yellow-poplar on very good sites may produce more dry-weight yield per acre than species such as oak with much denser wood. It may have potential as a producer of wood fiber for energy and other uses.",Special Uses,Yellow-Poplar,liriodendron,tulipifera,hardwood,16,0
