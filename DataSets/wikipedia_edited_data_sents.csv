13499,"In response to forest fires, the trees have developed various adaptations.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13500,"The thick, fibrous bark of coast redwoods is extremely fire-resistant; it grows to at least a foot thick and protects mature trees from fire damage.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13501,"In addition, the redwoods contain little flammable pitch or resin.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13502,"If damaged by fire, a redwood readily sprouts new branches or even an entirely new crown, and if the parent tree is killed, new buds sprout from its base.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13503,"Fires, moreover, appear to actually benefit redwoods by causing substantial mortality in competing species while having only minor effects on redwood.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13504,Burned areas are favorable to the successful germination of redwood seeds.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13505,"A study published in 2010, the first to compare post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species, concluded fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13506,Redwoods often grow in flood-prone areas.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13507,"Sediment deposits can form impermeable barriers that suffocate tree roots, and unstable soil in flooded areas often causes trees to lean to one side, increasing the risk of the wind toppling them.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13508,"Immediately after a flood, redwoods grow their existing roots upwards into recently deposited sediment layers.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13509,A second root system then develops from adventitious buds on the newly buried trunk and the old root system dies.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13510,"To counter lean, redwoods increase wood production on the vulnerable side, creating a supporting buttress.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13511,These adaptations create forests of almost exclusively redwood trees in flood-prone regions.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13512,The height of S. sempervirens is closely tied to fog availability; taller trees become less frequent as fog becomes less frequent.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13513,"As S. sempervirens' height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly difficult due to gravity.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13514,"Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100 cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13515,This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13516,"Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13517,"To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13518,Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6

13520,Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark.,Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
13521,"The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms, which occur when cavitations form in the xylem preventing the transport of water and nutrients.",Ecology,,Sequoia,sempervirens,,6
